[00:00.000 --> 00:11.300]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:19.300 --> 00:23.420]  Well nature has come out in an official policy
[00:24.420 --> 00:27.740]  statement and said that cyber attacks directed by Russia
[00:27.740 --> 00:30.400]  against any Western infrastructure
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.560]  Any computer systems will be seen as an act of war and that NATO may respond with military force
[00:37.960 --> 00:42.600]  That is really an unprecedented statement. We'll be looking at that today speaking of living on the edge
[00:43.040 --> 00:46.800]  Bright Bart is now reporting on something that we began to expose five years ago
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.220]  The Syrian conflict started by NATO and the Clintonistas along with the Obama crew
[00:51.840 --> 00:53.640]  Obama and men
[00:53.640 --> 00:55.080]  aided group
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.560]  That became ISIS to control area where ISIS formed its caliphate
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.080]  And the point is is that there are now more government memos and Pentagon reports coming out
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.680]  Confirming everything the Pentagon told us five years ago
[01:10.240 --> 01:16.760]  And of course, we didn't need the Pentagon to tell us we were already exposing it the Pentagon just confirmed that to info wars
[01:17.160 --> 01:18.400]  dot-com
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.000]  They also told Psyhurst that they also told many others that who did not run with a story at the first
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.320]  Because they were too afraid to and I'm not criticizing those people. It's just everyone needs to understand
[01:30.320 --> 01:33.080]  I don't get up here and make things up
[01:33.880 --> 01:37.320]  Sometimes I'm satirical sometimes we you know have a little bit of fun
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.360]  But we're very clear and demarc with demarcation when we're being silly versus when we're being serious and more and more
[01:44.760 --> 01:50.880]  I'm not silly even though that's something that takes the edge off and gallows humor is certainly needed more and more
[01:50.880 --> 01:55.240]  We are about 98% very serious around here these days because
[01:55.880 --> 02:03.040]  The time is getting late as Jimmy Hendricks would say or I guess as Bob Dylan would say when he wrote all along a watchtower
[02:04.600 --> 02:06.920]  Boy, I tell you this is going to be a broadcast today
[02:06.920 --> 02:13.600]  I had dr. Tony bark coming on an amazing medical doctor exposing the dangers of vaccines with all the terror heating up
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.520]  And what's happening in the economy?
[02:14.520 --> 02:18.480]  I'm offering to move her into the fourth hour Rob do because he loves to talk about vaccines
[02:18.480 --> 02:24.000]  So do I but he really is into that even more than I am such a central issue or she can come on this next week
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  But we've got jacari Jackson
[02:26.280 --> 02:32.880]  Coming on at the bottom of the next hour. He got some really eye-opening just some of the most amazing of a giant
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.040]  system
[02:35.040 --> 02:40.680]  Constellation of amazing footage that our crew have gotten in the last year at Trump rallies
[02:40.920 --> 02:44.680]  He got some really amazing footage that we're going to be going over
[02:44.680 --> 02:51.360]  Today, we'll be playing some of those clips. He's been on the road covering anti-trump events the last three days
[02:52.240 --> 02:59.520]  several of our reporters as we speak are in a car driving to Dallas to cover the Trump event tonight that
[03:01.480 --> 03:07.360]  Is it seven o'clock there are reportedly socialist and Democrats in battleground Texas groups
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.600]  That's an illegal alien promoting group basically that are saying they are giving you know
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.320]  Thousands of people free bus rise from all the state to confel great
[03:17.200 --> 03:25.640]  Up in big D and that kicks off tonight at seven will have coverage of that on the nightly news tonight seven o'clock central
[03:26.600 --> 03:33.240]  So definitely stay with info wars comm for all of that today. We also have
[03:34.920 --> 03:41.840]  Citizens for Trump the head of that organization on highly recommended by Roger stone and then hold Trump operation
[03:41.840 --> 03:43.600]  separately
[03:43.600 --> 03:50.760]  They have been basically denied permits for myself and Roger Scott and others to hold free speech rallies in Cleveland
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.800]  And so the ACLU has asked some myself and others to become co-signatories to a lawsuit
[03:57.480 --> 04:03.680]  Demanding access to the First Amendment. They're in Cleveland and we're going to be doing that. I'm going to be a plaintiff
[04:04.040 --> 04:08.040]  To that and I'm going to demonstrate. So that's just the end of it
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.400]  And the communists of course will be running around attacking police and everything will be coddled and protected by the police
[04:14.400 --> 04:17.440]  It's a Democrat run city and I'm sure will will be
[04:18.320 --> 04:25.320]  excoriated for being horrible and evil and just peacefully engaging the First Amendment, but it's it's going to happen. So that's that's just the way it is
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.600]  Black lives matter can organize it's you know latest move to shoot cops in the back of the head and be given all the permits
[04:31.600 --> 04:34.240]  They could ever want of course they just don't even get permits that are left alone
[04:34.240 --> 04:40.880]  Because it's all this George Soros funded garbage the same people that fund ISIS and that fund the Nazis in Ukraine and every other evil
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.440]  Organization are just trying to overthrow this country and bully us into submission and I don't know how all this is going to end
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.440]  But I know this I'm not backing down. I'm not giving in I'm not giving up
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.640]  Especially when we're starting to turn the tide against the slime big transmission huge news across the board
[04:55.120 --> 04:57.640]  Straight ahead they're coming after our guns big time
[04:57.640 --> 05:02.840]  Everyone Obama and Trump as well as the NRA and
[05:03.440 --> 05:08.920]  LGBT lobbyists are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.520]  National security Democrats in Congress just ended a 15-hour filibuster
[05:14.080 --> 05:20.080]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist
[05:20.080 --> 05:27.240]  Remember this is secretly and without trial people are put on terror watch lists and no fly watch lists without their knowledge
[05:27.240 --> 05:34.400]  Without being told of the charges against them without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.040]  Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them
[05:38.040 --> 05:45.000]  This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop terror attacks are not a gun control issue
[05:45.000 --> 05:52.240]  They're a border control issue without background checks for migrants terrorists are free to use nuclear biological or chemical weapons a
[05:52.360 --> 05:56.080]  Rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon
[05:56.080 --> 05:58.080]  We're info wars calm. I'm David Knight
[05:58.920 --> 06:05.560]  More than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy
[06:05.560 --> 06:11.960]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government
[06:12.200 --> 06:18.400]  Knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[06:18.400 --> 06:25.840]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today
[06:25.840 --> 06:29.840]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in
[06:30.600 --> 06:37.960]  2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now
[06:37.960 --> 06:39.960]  Saying could be the biggest
[06:40.080 --> 06:43.800]  Revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself
[06:43.800 --> 06:50.240]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen
[06:50.240 --> 06:58.360]  Stock up on survival shield x2 today at info wars life calm or by calling 888-253-3139
[06:58.760 --> 07:04.520]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price
[07:04.520 --> 07:08.680]  You are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why my friends
[07:08.680 --> 07:14.920]  We already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen solar generators really do provide
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.960]  Life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[07:19.960 --> 07:25.620]  I'm at no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the Sun whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts
[07:26.200 --> 07:30.480]  Intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[07:30.480 --> 07:36.480]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge
[07:36.480 --> 07:44.280]  Solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for info Wars listeners
[07:44.280 --> 07:49.400]  So it's a good time to check it out go to grid Wars calm. That's grid wars calm
[07:49.400 --> 08:07.000]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money go to grid Wars calm. That's grid Wars calm
[08:07.000 --> 08:16.160]  The world is a dangerous place not because of evil
[08:16.280 --> 08:19.680]  But because of those who look on and do nothing
[08:20.440 --> 08:24.840]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[08:24.840 --> 08:41.120]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center. It's Alex Jones
[08:41.120 --> 08:54.200]  Matt Roger came out yesterday and told the head of Homeland Security
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.120]  If you want us to turn our guns in you say that's a matter of Homeland Security turn your guns in
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.400]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway
[09:06.160 --> 09:08.160]  Use it only in emergency
[09:08.160 --> 09:12.240]  What it comes down to the fact the song continues on
[09:16.360 --> 09:23.000]  Guns aren't going to save us in the final equation, but if they do get the guns, that's the final symbol of slavery
[09:24.840 --> 09:31.160]  It's one of the final pieces in making us domesticated slaves with almost no chance of returning things around
[09:31.160 --> 09:37.280]  And that's why tyrants have a hunger an
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.080]  Instinct to disarm us, but it will be free speech and ideas and intellectual freedom
[09:44.480 --> 09:51.400]  That will lead the vanguard of the new renaissance and if the enemy then wants to offensively attack us it will be
[09:51.960 --> 09:53.760]  guns and
[09:53.760 --> 10:01.920]  Weapons in the physical war that will complete the circle and deliver us back into the good graces of Liberty
[10:03.920 --> 10:07.640]  And that's why today I thought I would just display this
[10:09.080 --> 10:10.760]  Flat black
[10:10.760 --> 10:15.480]  Judge I've been buying judges since tourists came out with them 20 years ago
[10:15.480 --> 10:20.720]  And I think I've probably got four or five of these. This is the this is the self-defense weapon
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.720]  I tend to have around the house
[10:22.720 --> 10:25.960]  A quick access but that way you don't shoot through walls
[10:26.840 --> 10:35.080]  That way you don't kill your neighbors and you don't have to be as good a shot if you're half asleep or startled
[10:35.680 --> 10:38.160]  The safest thing in your house is about a number seven
[10:38.800 --> 10:42.440]  Here at the office. I may need a little bit more distance on somebody. I've got
[10:43.800 --> 10:46.520]  What is it triple-ot buck for?
[10:47.960 --> 10:49.960]  44 caliber pellets in each
[10:49.960 --> 10:51.960]  shotgun
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.480]  Cartridge and and and Taurus isn't a sponsor though. They should be because for me. This is just a really great
[11:02.200 --> 11:07.240]  Firearm, this is one two two five zero zero zero buck Remington
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.800]  Ultimate home defense and I've tested these out on wet phone books and I've also tested these out on
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.120]  On small game and I have found this to be the best round
[11:19.120 --> 11:24.320]  They've got a lot of other supposedly fancier ones that have different odd shapes and things or shoot darts out
[11:24.320 --> 11:30.680]  That's all just a gimmick. You want to go with good old-fashioned buckshot because it's philosophy is a lot higher
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.800]  Unless you're getting you're in your house
[11:32.800 --> 11:37.440]  then you want to go like a number seven seven and a half but up close it'll kill somebody dead in a hammer and
[11:38.240 --> 11:41.480]  This is what it's all about that way. You don't shoot at somebody
[11:41.480 --> 11:48.680]  It goes through them and then kills somebody on the other side. It just dissipates its force on the target
[11:49.600 --> 11:51.600]  And then you're done
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.920]  And of course with a shotgun cartridge it dissipates not just because of there being more
[11:59.880 --> 12:07.520]  Pellets but also because there's a shorter shorter barrel, but they don't weigh as much and so they dissipate and lose force and you really aren't lethal it
[12:07.920 --> 12:09.920]  passed maybe a hundred yards with
[12:09.920 --> 12:11.920]  Triple-Ot buckshot
[12:13.160 --> 12:15.160]  With the number seven and a half bird shot
[12:15.880 --> 12:17.880]  You're not really lethal
[12:17.960 --> 12:19.960]  Anywhere past 20 30 40 feet
[12:21.560 --> 12:25.640]  But up close somebody's breaking in your house shoot somebody 10 feet away
[12:26.280 --> 12:28.280]  it's gonna go
[12:28.280 --> 12:30.280]  almost through them and
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.320]  Disappear all its force inside their body and then you are alive and they are dead imagine if
[12:36.040 --> 12:38.040]  the
[12:38.040 --> 12:41.120]  Security guard licensed to carry hadn't turned and run
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.520]  In Orlando imagine if someone would have fired back
[12:47.040 --> 12:51.200]  Imagine what would have happened because it doesn't matter if the person's wearing a bulletproof vest
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.120]  You shoot at somebody with a shotgun handgun or shotgun
[12:56.800 --> 12:58.800]  rifle style
[12:59.040 --> 13:05.680]  You aim towards their head you're going to end up hitting them with some pellets and they're not going to be in a position to continue to kill people
[13:05.680 --> 13:08.240]  and that's the whole point of
[13:09.920 --> 13:13.440]  Defending yourself you shoot somebody with a seven millimeter mag
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.360]  Let's say in that place. It's gonna go through the body armor through them and out the back and hit somebody else
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.200]  But again, I'm not even mr. Firearms expert, but compared to these disarmed slaves
[13:23.640 --> 13:26.360]  I'm a completely different animal completely different creature
[13:27.400 --> 13:32.400]  And so again, I would just recommend that everyone go out and get a firearm
[13:32.400 --> 13:36.400]  There is also a video that Tim Kennedy talked about yesterday
[13:37.200 --> 13:44.000]  Right at the end of the interview I did with him and I'm gonna ask one of our great editors Darren McBreen or whoever can do it to real fast
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.920]  Grab the last five minutes of the Tim Kennedy interview and he brought up
[13:49.640 --> 13:57.600]  One of these Buzzfeed videos. They're pushing the left is showing a leftist shooting a M4 or an AR 15
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.720]  That basically has no kick a five-year-old could shoot these all day
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.520]  Now if you held it totally listlessly with no force it might jerk a little bit into your shoulder
[14:11.520 --> 14:18.520]  But they sell this perception that firearms are just these devastatingly, you know dangerous explosive things
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  That no one can control
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.320]  But somebody's not scared of a nail gun or scared of a chainsaw or scared of something else that on average
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.360]  You're gonna get injured with a lot more often a lawnmower. It's a big spinning
[14:33.920 --> 14:40.840]  Sling blade Kaiser blade. I mean super deadly chop your foot right off chop your toes right off happens all the time
[14:40.840 --> 14:42.320]  It didn't even make the news
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.320]  There's just an accident
[14:44.320 --> 14:53.000]  Firearms are built for safety. They fire a projectile out the front where you're aiming them if you just learn basic safety and get past the
[14:53.720 --> 14:58.080]  mystic awe and fear around it we can win this culture war
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.880]  But we've got to take trendies out and we've got to get them to be able to fire firearms and learn how to use them
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.320]  Responsibly, that's why they're putting out all these videos. I've noticed
[15:08.880 --> 15:12.280]  Where people fire two two threes
[15:12.280 --> 15:14.280]  people fire
[15:16.920 --> 15:18.920]  Five six six
[15:18.960 --> 15:22.920]  However, you do dominate it and it shows them being knocked over and falling down
[15:22.920 --> 15:29.480]  That is being done like the old police academy movies where the little old lady shoots the 357 Magnum and it blows her back through the wall
[15:29.480 --> 15:33.640]  I mean, I was firing 357 Magnums when I was six years old
[15:33.640 --> 15:41.280]  The secret is you just hold it with a little bit of force and control in your hand and it just kicks back
[15:42.440 --> 15:47.520]  With the force of a puppy pushing its paw into you, I mean, it's just nothing
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.520]  Now I will say I've gone out and shot a hundred rounds of 50 cal before and not really paid attention
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.520]  It just done it like I'm relaxed and
[15:54.800 --> 15:57.440]  Then it you know kind of knocked my back out of play
[15:57.440 --> 15:59.720]  But as long as you tense up when you're firing it, it's not a problem
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.840]  But that's that's different when you're holding some, you know, 50 pound Barrett
[16:05.280 --> 16:10.120]  Naval, you know version or army version and you're sitting there, you know
[16:10.760 --> 16:14.240]  Firing and over and over again. Yes, then then you can have some issues
[16:14.840 --> 16:17.000]  But it's just a lot of folks I tell them
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.760]  I think the judge is a great firearm because it's a legal
[16:21.640 --> 16:23.520]  shotgun cartridge
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.240]  In a handgun the equivalent of a sawed-off shotgun and it's just a lot of power
[16:28.240 --> 16:33.640]  And it's just versatile on so many fronts and doesn't kill people on the other side of the wall unless you're shooting
[16:34.160 --> 16:35.640]  triple-ot buck or
[16:35.640 --> 16:37.640]  slugs and
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.280]  There's almost no kick from this I
[16:41.920 --> 16:48.440]  Mean my children at age seven or eight have you know gone out and fired these even with slugs out in the country?
[16:48.440 --> 16:58.960]  And you just teach them to sit there and hold it with some force have control keep their finger off the trigger until they're ready
[16:58.960 --> 17:02.480]  Cock the firearm aim at the target pull the trigger and
[17:04.160 --> 17:05.840]  Then
[17:05.840 --> 17:12.160]  Forever they are free of the anti-gun brainwashing cult now. I've already digressed into that
[17:12.160 --> 17:14.640]  But I'm gonna obviously get into the news on that front
[17:14.640 --> 17:20.760]  They're coming for the Second Amendment. They want executive orders to ban semi-autos to ban their manufacture to ban their sale
[17:20.760 --> 17:23.720]  Obama actually said it as you know two days ago and again yesterday
[17:23.720 --> 17:29.440]  We spent most the first hour yesterday playing that clip going over to now J. Johnson came out and said that
[17:30.360 --> 17:35.000]  It's Homeland Security's job and that for Homeland Security and public safety. We must restrict
[17:35.720 --> 17:40.840]  Firearms and he said because of growing American terrorism the same quotes we heard out of Obama
[17:40.840 --> 17:43.360]  They also want people to be put on a
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.720]  A no-gun buy list just like you're on a no-fly list
[17:47.560 --> 17:52.080]  When they sit there and say if you're on a no-fly list, we want you on the no-gun buy list
[17:52.080 --> 17:54.320]  It's the same thing. No one knows how you're put on it
[17:54.760 --> 18:01.120]  You can't get off of it. We had Tim Kennedy top anti-terrorism expert 15-year special forces a
[18:01.880 --> 18:03.880]  lot of that in
[18:03.880 --> 18:06.680]  Domestic anti-terrorism operations. I'll just stop right there, but that's known
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.960]  Agreeing with me that it destroys the process. It's horrible. It's out of control Johnson's pushing that too
[18:12.960 --> 18:20.160]  And drudge came out with the tweets drudge to DHS secretary give up your guns first the reason it's important when drudge came here last year
[18:20.600 --> 18:22.520]  And he said to Obama
[18:22.520 --> 18:24.520]  Give up your guns first
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  That became a meme and and then you saw
[18:32.880 --> 18:35.040]  Other people like Ted Nugent pick it up
[18:35.040 --> 18:39.880]  You saw Donald Trump pick it up and and now the general public's picked it up because that's an idea that's unstoppable
[18:39.880 --> 18:43.200]  Michael Moore has bodyguards Hillary Clinton has bodyguards
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.880]  Steven Spielberg has armed bodyguards. They've all got former special forces
[18:49.760 --> 18:54.960]  Commandos they might be American but most of those are conservatives, so they're not they're either Israeli or French and
[18:55.120 --> 18:57.120]  I mean, I've been to a lot of those people's houses
[18:57.440 --> 18:59.440]  That's who's there?
[19:00.200 --> 19:05.760]  Usually at least two of them and they've got armed commandos protecting
[19:05.760 --> 19:16.560]  And most of commandos Hollywood have I guess you're far and not even so much because they're not libertarian or conservative because usually they're
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.760]  You know their listeners when I talk to them even though they're French or Israeli or German or whatever a lot of them are Israeli
[19:21.760 --> 19:23.760]  I guess that's kind of you know cool in Hollywood
[19:24.400 --> 19:30.420]  But Hollywood hires foreign commandos because they don't like American soldiers really what it comes down to that's how
[19:30.420 --> 19:38.260]  Anti-America the whole mindset is is just oh, we just don't have a lot of I mean a former American special forces here
[19:38.260 --> 19:39.300]  just because
[19:39.300 --> 19:41.900]  They just don't quote service Hollywood. That's a side issue
[19:42.380 --> 19:47.580]  Once everybody realizes that they've all got bodyguards a lot of the taxpayer expense. It's game over
[19:47.580 --> 19:49.580]  They live in a total gunculture themselves
[19:49.940 --> 19:55.500]  But just don't want us to be part of it because they want a bunch of domesticated slaves that they can totally control
[19:56.140 --> 19:58.140]  It's that simple
[19:58.140 --> 20:04.760]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate
[20:04.780 --> 20:08.340]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives
[20:08.580 --> 20:13.220]  You never know when there will be another Katrina an economic collapse or a serious drought
[20:13.460 --> 20:16.980]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times
[20:17.060 --> 20:23.380]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that a US company named Harvest Wright has a kitchen appliance
[20:23.380 --> 20:30.060]  That can help you be prepared. It's a home freeze-dryer with the product you can preserve the food your family loves
[20:30.060 --> 20:34.980]  And the best part is the food will last 25 years and still tastes great
[20:35.260 --> 20:39.380]  I've tried it and it's amazing with a home freeze-dryer from Harvest Wright
[20:39.380 --> 20:46.860]  You can literally freeze dry anything you eat even things like ice cream to learn more call Harvest Wright today at

[20:59.380 --> 21:03.660]  Hi, I'm 54 years of age and at Christmas time last year a resident
[21:03.660 --> 21:07.820]  I take care of at work accidentally rolled over my right foot with his motorized scooter
[21:07.820 --> 21:11.340]  I was back into a corner and he put it in reverse and did it again
[21:11.340 --> 21:15.300]  The bones in my foot weren't actually broken, but damage was done
[21:15.300 --> 21:20.700]  The remedy was to just let the foot heal on its own and this was expected to take many weeks as a caregiver
[21:20.700 --> 21:24.140]  I do a lot of walking and I was sort of okay when I was in motion
[21:24.420 --> 21:27.140]  It's when I stopped to rest that I really felt the pain
[21:27.180 --> 21:30.060]  The pain was there getting out of bed in the morning, too
[21:30.060 --> 21:34.100]  So I got on the one-world way and he was back and I just had to write this testimony
[21:34.100 --> 21:36.100]  No more pain, nothing
[21:36.100 --> 21:41.100]  I can only attribute this to the one-world way since I haven't introduced anything else into my life
[21:41.100 --> 21:47.220]  It's product of the true godsend. It gives me energy and did whatever magic this stuff does to heal my poor foot

[24:14.580 --> 24:18.580]  I'm your host Alex Jones and this is The Info War
[24:18.580 --> 24:25.580]  The Info War
[24:25.580 --> 24:31.580]  So Rolling Stone came out yesterday with it's time to repeal the Second Amendment
[24:31.580 --> 24:33.580]  Just take the guns
[24:33.580 --> 24:38.580]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in to quote
[24:38.580 --> 24:42.580]  Diane Feinstein
[24:42.580 --> 24:49.580]  Well now, this is up on infowars.com, UCLA professor, Congress should secretly suspend Second Amendment
[24:49.580 --> 24:53.580]  Ah, that's how they do it, just put you on a no gun by list
[24:53.580 --> 24:59.580]  So that's just some of what's going on, but we have this being called for everywhere
[24:59.580 --> 25:04.580]  There's the headline for TV viewers, why it's time to repeal the Second Amendment
[25:04.580 --> 25:09.580]  It needs to be repealed because it's outdated, a threat to liberty
[25:09.580 --> 25:15.580]  And a suicide pack, even though overall crime using guns is down upwards of 60% since 1992
[25:15.580 --> 25:20.580]  FBI unified crime statistics and mass shootings are flat
[25:20.580 --> 25:27.580]  Everyone thinks that alligator attacks are over the top and everyone now in Florida and all over is scared to swim
[25:27.580 --> 25:35.580]  One child's been eaten, they should have killed the alligator two weeks ago when it came running out of the bushes and tried to eat another little kid
[25:35.580 --> 25:44.580]  Disney World was politically correct and didn't, so the gator half-child the poor little toddler, cute little photos
[25:44.580 --> 25:53.580]  But the point is still, imagine how scary that is, a big lizard, a big amphibious lizard eating your child
[25:53.580 --> 26:00.580]  See, that's sensational, just like it's sensational that 49 people got killed in Orlando and it is terrible
[26:00.580 --> 26:08.580]  And it is happening and it's a lot more dangerous than all the shark attacks in the world in the last seven, eight years
[26:08.580 --> 26:13.580]  On average it's about maybe 12, 13 shark attack deaths a year, worldwide
[26:13.580 --> 26:20.580]  There might have been 50 gay people beaten to death in the last 20, 30 years
[26:20.580 --> 26:26.580]  You know, being mugged because of their sexual preference, 49 died
[26:26.580 --> 26:33.580]  And you don't hear a word about Islam, so it's all how they present things
[26:33.580 --> 26:39.580]  And they're presenting it right now that it's the fault of the Second Amendment and Americans' rights
[26:39.580 --> 26:45.580]  And I know you as an audience get this better than I do, but that's why I'm hammering Islam so hard
[26:45.580 --> 26:52.580]  Because we can't just give it a pass and just hope the jihadi stop killing us, that's bad enough
[26:52.580 --> 26:58.580]  But they're going to go find liberal victim disarmament zones where they feel safe to cowardly kill as many people as they can
[26:58.580 --> 27:01.580]  They're not going to hit harder targets, patriot targets
[27:01.580 --> 27:08.580]  Look how it went for them at a conservative event in Dallas, dead before they could even get out of their cars
[27:08.580 --> 27:14.580]  Dead within seconds of starting to fire shots, dead, dead, dead
[27:14.580 --> 27:20.580]  No, we're not just talking about hundreds getting killed every year by Islamists now here in the United States
[27:20.580 --> 27:26.580]  And thousands and thousands per country in the Middle East every month
[27:26.580 --> 27:29.580]  Hundreds of thousands every year, and hundreds and hundreds in Europe
[27:29.580 --> 27:33.580]  No, no, no, we're talking about them killing our right of free speech
[27:33.580 --> 27:36.580]  And killing our Second Amendment, the right to self-defense
[27:36.580 --> 27:40.580]  And then killing our Fourth Amendment saying none of us have any rights to privacy
[27:40.580 --> 27:44.580]  Because they've got to protect us from the very jihadis the traitor government brought in
[27:44.580 --> 27:50.580]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean, between the two they lick the platter clean
[27:50.580 --> 27:55.580]  That's why I say the jihadis the magic, magic, magic skeleton key of the New World Order
[27:55.580 --> 28:02.580]  The West brings them in, they get to make us be politically correct and submit to them, the terrorist attack
[28:02.580 --> 28:06.580]  They get to take more of our rights, they get to have civil emergencies, restricting our freedoms
[28:06.580 --> 28:11.580]  In the name of countering the threat they brought in all because of the death of logic
[28:11.580 --> 28:19.580]  Merkel is to blame, Hollande is to blame, Hillary Clinton is to blame, Barack Obama is to blame
[28:19.580 --> 28:25.580]  And the Republican leadership going along with the open borders is to blame
[28:25.580 --> 28:30.580]  I am not to blame when I try to get on an airplane and they want to after I go through the scanners and everything
[28:30.580 --> 28:33.580]  Want to touch my genitals, that's why I went with the naked body scanners
[28:33.580 --> 28:36.580]  Because I know they save the images, that was confirmed years after we documented it
[28:36.580 --> 28:41.580]  But on top of that, it's all fake, so the former head of Homeland Security Cherdoth makes money
[28:41.580 --> 28:45.580]  His company's made billions, he's made more than 30 million last time I checked
[28:45.580 --> 28:51.580]  And then when Saudi Arabians come through, they don't even put them through the machines, because it's against their religion
[28:51.580 --> 28:58.580]  It's a joke, and then even if you go through the scanner, a lot of times they want you to go over and get groped some more
[28:58.580 --> 29:02.580]  And oh, let's check your bag to see if there's explosives
[29:02.580 --> 29:10.580]  When they already ran my ID and put me through a database and no, I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in like three years
[29:10.580 --> 29:18.580]  They know full well, they've got an entire digital dossier on me
[29:18.580 --> 29:23.580]  Doesn't matter though, I've got to be trained, my children have to be trained, how to be prisoners
[29:23.580 --> 29:26.580]  As the border stays wide open
[29:26.580 --> 29:30.580]  So I'm going to talk more about this attack on the Second Amendment and then tie it together
[29:30.580 --> 29:35.580]  Oh, government documents released, Obama administration aided group that became ISIS to control area
[29:35.580 --> 29:38.580]  Where ISIS formed the caliphate
[29:38.580 --> 29:41.580]  We're going to get into NATO, says it might now have grounds to attack Russia
[29:41.580 --> 29:44.580]  Oh yes, this is official, this is really big
[29:44.580 --> 29:48.580]  We'll look at a bunch of communists and socialist utopias that are currently collapsing into flames
[29:48.580 --> 29:50.580]  We're on the march
[29:50.580 --> 29:52.580]  The Empire's on the run
[29:52.580 --> 29:55.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:55.580 --> 29:59.580]  Social justice warrior footage that Jakarta Jackson got
[29:59.580 --> 30:05.580]  2017 National Defense Authorization Act as summarized by the Senate Armed Services Committee
[30:05.580 --> 30:10.580]  Proposes a 25% reduction in generals and admirals across the board
[30:10.580 --> 30:12.580]  Reports The Daily Collar
[30:12.580 --> 30:17.580]  A summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers
[30:17.580 --> 30:21.580]  Also applies at the three, two and one star levels
[30:21.580 --> 30:24.580]  The committee reasons that over the past 30 years
[30:24.580 --> 30:33.580]  The strength of the joint force has decreased 38% but the ratio of four star officers to the overall force has increased by 65%
[30:33.580 --> 30:38.580]  The bill's summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the three and four star level
[30:38.580 --> 30:42.580]  It can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders
[30:42.580 --> 30:46.580]  The summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction
[30:46.580 --> 30:51.580]  Saying that the Pentagon must proactively work to shift as many personnel as possible
[30:51.580 --> 30:55.580]  From staff functions to operational and other vital roles
[30:55.580 --> 31:21.580]  To find more reports at infowars.com

[33:32.580 --> 33:42.580]  And then they brought in a bunch of incompatible people from the Middle East that had been killing each other for over a thousand years
[33:42.580 --> 33:57.580]  And then they launched a worldwide Saudi Arabian and Western-backed Islamic offensive of terrorist attacks, sex slavery and radicalization
[33:57.580 --> 34:06.580]  And they shipped Stinger missiles and anti-tank missiles to them by the thousands and gave them billions of dollars
[34:06.580 --> 34:20.580]  And then had the nerve to protect these radical networks, these radical mosques who openly get on TV and say to their practitioners, to their flock of weasels
[34:20.580 --> 34:31.580]  Go out and kill gays and kill single women having sex out of wedlock
[34:31.580 --> 34:36.580]  No one goes to jail, no one gets investigated and the FBI is ordered to stand down
[34:36.580 --> 34:44.580]  I'm living in the Twilight Zone and let me tell you something, if you think this screw job you're living under is bad, yet get ready
[34:44.580 --> 34:50.580]  Because they have brought people in from the most backward third world, nut house countries
[34:50.580 --> 34:57.580]  Where the people are so backstabbing and so psychotic, they can't even get their act together to have running water
[34:57.580 --> 35:00.580]  Countries where they wipe their butts with their hand
[35:00.580 --> 35:04.580]  Yes, that's why a Muslim will shake your hand with one hand not the other
[35:04.580 --> 35:11.580]  I'm not trying to be gross here, I'm just telling you, these aren't industrialized Muslim nations they're bringing these people in from
[35:11.580 --> 35:15.580]  They are bringing them in from Hill-Billy Central
[35:15.580 --> 35:22.580]  And they are here and they are flipping out when they walk into a movie theater and they've got men and women in the same bathroom
[35:22.580 --> 35:27.580]  What do you think they're going to do? They're going to go nuts, they're going to go out to their car, they're going to get a knife
[35:27.580 --> 35:32.580]  They're going to come in and start stabbing people or they're going to flip out and go get a gun and shoot people
[35:32.580 --> 35:41.580]  And then I'll be blamed, you'll be blamed by the very leftist media combine that knows exactly what they're doing
[35:41.580 --> 35:46.580]  But I'm going to stop right there because I want to get to some of this other news here in a moment
[35:46.580 --> 35:54.580]  Briefly, I want all the listeners and viewers to know that I want to thank you for your support
[35:54.580 --> 36:02.580]  Spreading the words, sending out the videos, the articles, you're the reason that InfoWars is just really when it comes to actually reaching people exploding
[36:02.580 --> 36:10.580]  But it's a paradox, there's a global depression in most areas, our economy is really in a depression, though it's not evenly distributed obviously
[36:10.580 --> 36:16.580]  And the mainstream media has everything it can to cover that up
[36:16.580 --> 36:38.580]  But when you do buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com, all really great products, things that everybody needs, water filtration systems, non-GMO, heirloom seeds and nutraceuticals, books, films, libertarian, patriot, Americana apparel that promotes a message of freedom and resistance to tyranny, it's all there
[36:38.580 --> 36:44.580]  When you purchase products there, it makes what we do here completely and totally possible
[36:44.580 --> 37:00.580]  So Tim Kennedy has joined InfoWars to start promoting a weekly series on preparedness, on combat training, on humet, on identifying criminal operatives, jihadi operatives, you name it, in your area
[37:00.580 --> 37:16.580]  It's great to have the top army soldier, he's recognized as like the top army soldier in every score, fighting, combat, shooting, analysis, photography, it just goes on and on
[37:16.580 --> 37:32.580]  It's great to have him advising and working with InfoWars now, and he is a big supporter of the products, BrainForce, Secret12, SuperMobileItality, the three products, he's got the anti-doping agency that oversees the UFC to approve him to take these
[37:32.580 --> 37:50.580]  And he's just blown away by him, I mean he kind of poo-poo's a lot of other supplements, SuperMobileItality really blew him away, quite frankly he said libido was the strongest thing, he's already right up there at the top one-tenth of one percent but he said he did field gains of strength, of recovery
[37:50.580 --> 38:06.580]  He said unlike any other workout enhancement herbal product out there because we really did set out to make cold pressed, concentrated, it's an oil basically, the most pure, unadulterated, unpasteurized, it hasn't been heated, that's what's so important
[38:06.580 --> 38:24.580]  Product, it's like wine, but it's really a blend of essential oils and herbs, SuperMobileItality, SuperMobileItality, I mean it's got almost five star reviews, thousands of reviews, it's like a 4.8, third party sites, it's so powerful, it's 15% off the Tim Kennedy Special
[38:24.580 --> 38:44.580]  SuperMobileItality, BrainForce and Secret12, you can get them all three together or get them separately, 15% off, again but it's also 15% off on those individually, you can also get free shipping on orders of $50 or more and when you sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off

[39:00.580 --> 39:19.580]  We've got four or five more slots in the reporting area to fill, we need more camera people, we need more editors, we need more writers, I'm maxed out though financially, but every time I expand we end up getting the support we need so I'm just going to go ahead and spend our reserves, put everything all in going through this election into next year
[39:19.580 --> 39:38.580]  And if we have the downsides next year we will, but I don't think that's going to happen, I think you're going to support us, m4store.com is the umbrella site m4slife.com is the nutraceuticals, as part of our partnership with Special Forces operator and UFC fighter Tim Kennedy we're giving you 15% off the top m4s life formulas used by Tim Kennedy

[39:51.580 --> 39:57.580]  Which he said wasn't a huge next level but very noticeable and real after working out six hours a day
[39:57.580 --> 40:08.580]  And the guy is a freak by the way, I mean that's well known, all three products have hundreds of five star reviews and contain the known herbs that help boost the body naturally

[40:42.580 --> 40:55.580]  Okay I'm done, done plugging except for this fact, continue to spread the word about the local AFM stations you're on, don't take that for granted that we're in a serious info war and the globalists are in everything they can to try to block this information
[40:55.580 --> 41:05.580]  Spread the word, become a sponsor, let the sponsors know why you're supporting them whether a dry cleaners or a car dealership or whoever it is or become a sponsor
[41:05.580 --> 41:17.580]  Or start your own show or send them $100 or put the frequency of the station on the side of your business or the side of your barn or put an ad in the paper for the local station and tell them I'm doing this because you're carrying the Alex Jones show
[41:17.580 --> 41:21.580]  And chances are if they're carrying this broadcast they're carrying other good projects
[41:21.580 --> 41:29.580]  Man I tell you we're all in this fight, I know a lot of you have done a lot of great things, there's no way for me to thank you all, I read your letters, I see your emails, I'm working
[41:29.580 --> 41:43.580]  I'll be honest I only work like 10-12 hours a day now that I'm 40 something and I've got three children and a lot of them because I physically work 18 hours a day sometimes but then it degrades my other work, I just work intensely and more focused now
[41:43.580 --> 42:03.580]  But I did work 18 hours a day for many years and you saw it into my body and so I just need to have a long run here so I've cut back to a huge media load, probably one of the biggest media loads anybody has out there but not the joke level when I used to do six hours a day on radio and a TV show
[42:03.580 --> 42:18.580]  And basically even sometimes get in the shipping department and package packages myself, I mean I started out doing that 20 years ago making my first film and I would sit there in my apartment putting the VHS tapes in the package and mailing them out
[42:18.580 --> 42:34.580]  And that's how I built from that base totally zero all the way up to what we're here at now, I have responsibility to go for broke, be all in right now to hit the globalist with broad side after broad side, forget the maneuvers and go straight at them
[42:34.580 --> 42:41.580]  I'm going straight at them and I'm counting on Providence and it's been coming through so thank you for your prayers as well, I'm praying for you
[42:41.580 --> 42:55.580]  Okay, I got a bunch of Donald Trump clips that I've got to get to that are very powerful but first I want to play this incredible statement here, CIA director tells Congress he's focused on diversity after Pulse Club Massacre
[42:55.580 --> 43:11.580]  So the answer is run around and have feel good stuff about gay, gay, gay and everything's wonderful you know when you're part of a team and let's just propagandize everyone about how we should be nice to gay people and somehow radical Islamic extremist
[43:11.580 --> 43:27.580]  Whose father gets on the YouTube every week and says you know kill the gays and the guys emom says kill the gays the issue isn't hey we have people calling for murder the issue is oh you're the cause celeb that's like when breast cancer does up almost 3,000% in the United States and every other western country
[43:27.580 --> 43:43.580]  because glyphosate grows it amongst other things I mean admittedly grows it like miracle grow for tumors you know round up it's in the water table you might want to filter your water or you might want to dial up my breast cancer I don't know it's your choice it's hit my family hit her I mean I got daughters it just it really makes me angry and it's just it's just admitted fact by the way just you know like miracle
[43:43.580 --> 44:07.580]  grow, grow plants well glyphosate grows big giant estrogen based tumors it looks like estrogen in the body a very funky form of it and it tells weeds to die folks I know they told you you could drink it it was pure bulk the lobbyist that started that 20 years ago was asked that on Canadian TV and he said of course I'm not going to drink that I'm not crazy I just say that to the to the idiots but
[44:07.580 --> 44:19.580]  I told you it'll all be cause celeb you say what's breast cancer have to do with gays being killed they don't ever ask why is it exploding and is everybody getting it even 12 year olds getting it
[44:19.580 --> 44:39.580]  they they just say let's find a cure and then oh you know it's pink day at the restaurant you want to pay extra $10 for your food no I don't oh you don't care about breast cancer no I know what's causing a lot of it and I'm trying to warn people I'm really angry about it and as a man I don't like being hit with it and prostate cancer going up and I don't like the fact that men have
[44:39.580 --> 44:58.580]  to basically do all the stuff to block estrogen or we get female breast I don't like the fact that we're being messed with I want to stop the source of it oh but it's all let's have a run for breast cancer let's all wear pink let's all wear pink ribbons let's all remember our grandma that died no no I want somebody else's
[44:58.580 --> 45:13.580]  grandma to not die I had one grandmother die cancer mother grandmother has breast cancer he's had it for four years he's refusing to be operated on I get it she's 91 years old the point is that I want to stop it I want to cut it back
[45:13.580 --> 45:26.580]  I want to remove it it's like they back in the 50s they had tranquilizers for women that would cause the babies to have short arms and legs remember that they took it off the market imagine nowadays they if it came on the market today
[45:26.580 --> 45:42.580]  what was the name of that famous tranquilizer if it came on the market today they would just have runs and jogs and galas and fundraisers and events to try to figure out why the cure for people not having short arms and legs and giant heads and deformities
[45:42.580 --> 46:00.580]  instead you just stop giving people the tranquilizer but they're not taking the glyphosate out no no no no sir and they're not going to stop the Islamics going around and killing the homosexuals they're going to pistol whip you politically and tell you how you somehow weren't nice and you weren't
[46:00.580 --> 46:23.580]  you weren't tolerant and how you've got to go out and pledge your support to the Democratic Party Philetimide yeah look up Philetimide sold under the brand name Immua print among others and then it went on to that cause massive birth defects and about five years they figured it out and stopped it
[46:23.580 --> 46:34.580]  hundreds of thousands of birth defects worldwide it was what seven thousand in the United States but I'm going from memory go read it for yourself now
[46:34.580 --> 46:46.580]  we know what's causing a lot of the breast cancer and see that's how my little brain works I see the CIA with a statement about we're going to we're going to focus on diversity all that's going to do is cause more people to get killed
[46:46.580 --> 46:59.580]  when you've got a bunch of people parading around and jumping around in front of jihadis why don't you the CIA director who is an admitted Wahhabist who's converted to Islam that's admitted okay lived over there for many years
[46:59.580 --> 47:10.580]  an Arabist as they would say this guy is saying we all need to just be more diverse why don't you tell the gay people to go to Saudi Arabia and do that and then they get their heads chopped off
[47:10.580 --> 47:17.580]  oh no no no he doesn't tell the Saudis to do that he just he just lectures us yeah there it is pubmed.gov
[47:17.580 --> 47:29.580]  Glyphosate induces human breast cancer cells growth via estrogen receptors oh 2013 they knew that 30 years ago and they approved that weapon
[47:29.580 --> 47:34.580]  you know what grows big fat juicy brain tumors in all monkey species is given to it
[47:34.580 --> 47:52.580]  you know what kills more than half the Reese's monkey babies when it's added in a regular dose that you get in Diet Coke to the milk in 1975 study aspartame equal
[47:52.580 --> 48:05.580]  it'll equalize you all right but they just changed the name when he was the head of Searle rumsel couldn't get it approved so then they just changed the name and got it approved in 1981
[48:05.580 --> 48:17.580]  and it's killed tens of millions of people just like Glyphosate as but don't worry when your mommy or your daughter is in there getting radiated and dying from breast cancer
[48:17.580 --> 48:27.580]  don't listen to the conspiracy theorist okay because I was a little mean about how I talked about it even though I personally have been hit by this and I'm sick of it
[48:27.580 --> 48:38.580]  I have no right to try to save people or warn anyone I just shut up don't I I'm that evil person that told you four and a half years ago our government was running al Qaeda in Syria
[48:38.580 --> 48:46.580]  and was changing the name to ISIS a year before they did and all the rest of it now confirmed he classified admitted the truth is I'm telling the truth
[48:46.580 --> 48:58.580]  the truth is people can't handle the truth to quote that movie with Jack Nicholson a few good men you want answers
[48:58.580 --> 49:10.580]  I'm here giving you answers I'm giving you bibliograph proof in Treplicate every day the difference is what are you going to do about it
[49:10.580 --> 49:25.580]  so let's play as we go to break the CIA director John Brennan John Brennan who's lived for decades in Saudi Arabia with those pervs lecturing us about how he wants us to be diverse
[49:25.580 --> 49:33.580]  this from the most hypocritical this just makes me sick here it is we have the John Brennan clip
[49:33.580 --> 49:43.580]  the key part of this mindset is our commitment to making our workforce as diverse as the world we cover just last week the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a report
[49:43.580 --> 49:48.580]  showing that the intelligence community is significantly less diverse than the rest of the federal workforce
[49:48.580 --> 49:56.580]  this report that forces those of us in the intelligence community to confront some hard truths about who we are and how we are performing our mission
[49:56.580 --> 50:05.580]  as this committee knows CIA recently unveiled a landmark effort to make sure that our workforce reflects in our attitudes our backgrounds our ethnicities and our perspectives
[50:05.580 --> 50:17.580]  the nation we work so hard to defend this is both a moral and a mission imperative I truly believe that the business case for diversity is stronger for CIA than this for any other organization in the US government
[50:17.580 --> 50:30.580]  diversity not only gives us the cultural understanding we need to operate in any corner of the globe it also helps us avoid group think ensuring we bring to bear a range of perspectives on the complex challenges that are inherent to intelligence
[50:30.580 --> 50:49.580]  okay when he says group think they're not allowed to say radical Islam even so that's total group think they're not allowed to target any of the real people the father of this guy was brought in by the CIA it's now admitted and visited Obama at the White House and his brother-in-law runs bringing the so-called immigrants in
[50:49.580 --> 50:59.580]  the invaders in the migrants we use the proper group think word and then his answers just have little pink triangles all over the CIA and that'll stop it what a sick joke

[54:28.780 --> 54:35.340]  brought in from killing us but he goes on to admit to congress we haven't reduced ISIS terror reach

[55:19.740 --> 55:26.620]  revolutionaries and cnn wouldn't cover it cooper is cia and i want to explain something i'm not
[55:26.620 --> 55:34.700]  even seeing the cia itself is what's bad it's just this big unaccountable group operating since
[55:34.700 --> 55:42.700]  1947 on its own with criminal elements running it like specter that's what it is it i mean we are
[55:42.700 --> 55:47.900]  just wide open we've been conquered by whatever criminal groups run it and they do whatever they

[56:38.380 --> 56:43.580]  the good news is 95 percent of special forces knows that we have foreign elements running our
[56:43.580 --> 56:48.140]  government they know we're an occupied nation government within a government they understand
[56:48.140 --> 56:53.340]  the score and they finally four and a half years ago said we're not gonna aid al qaeda it's over
[56:54.140 --> 56:58.060]  and the split was huge so obama has fired thousands of different people in the brass
[56:58.060 --> 57:03.100]  and they are putting people in who were secretaries and things and a bunch of weirdos from harvard who
[57:03.100 --> 57:08.540]  never been in combat and all sorts i mean good this is a total grip of evil people that they'll
[57:08.540 --> 57:13.820]  that will cause total disrespect in the military and their days are numbered now the danger is
[57:13.820 --> 57:19.100]  though they've never been in wars so they're starting wars with russia now we're gonna cover
[57:19.100 --> 57:23.740]  this coming up so i say you know thank god and they start a civil war with us they're run by a
[57:23.740 --> 57:30.780]  bunch of potential pushers and you know weirdos but at the same time they're starting a war with
[57:30.780 --> 57:36.060]  russia up against their borders in three different areas starting a war with them sitting in proxy
[57:36.060 --> 57:41.180]  armies and now nato has come out it's on info wars dot com nato says it might now have grounds to
[57:41.180 --> 57:47.740]  attack russia that's from info wars dot com going off the nato announcements then there's uh say
[57:47.740 --> 57:53.820]  what nato could use controversial uh could use conventional weapons to respond to cyber attacks
[57:53.820 --> 57:57.900]  and there's now seeing a cyber attack on anything in the us or any other infrastructure in europe
[57:57.900 --> 58:02.620]  will be called an active war by russia they'll just claim russia did it and then attack russia
[58:02.620 --> 58:08.220]  so this is huge developments we're going to break all that down uh jacari jackson's in here at the
[58:08.220 --> 58:13.180]  bottom of the next hour but before that i'm going to play this clip by about eight after or so that
[58:13.180 --> 58:20.060]  is just amazing it's up on info wars dot com video 16 year old black trump supporter schools
[58:20.060 --> 58:25.260]  leftist in epic debate that's a great headline but it's not even good enough 16 year old black
[58:25.260 --> 58:32.300]  trump supporter schools black lives matter moron in epic debate and we're changing that
[58:32.300 --> 58:37.020]  headline right now because this black lives matter person is just the perfect hillary
[58:37.020 --> 58:41.020]  supporter dumber more ignorant than you can imagine i mean it's it's just like the mark
[58:41.020 --> 58:46.460]  dice videos we're not just cherry picking this this is people are live dot com today

[59:09.100 --> 59:13.020]  i got my bottle of brain force right there and popped two of them and about 20 minutes later
[59:13.020 --> 59:18.380]  it's like bing everything just kind of clears up it's got four and a half stars people really love
[59:18.380 --> 59:23.180]  it read about it find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[59:23.180 --> 59:28.620]  because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off
[59:28.620 --> 59:31.980]  i haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while but i probably could not have done it without

[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.860]  but of course a lot of people in the government corporations knew what was happening before i did
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.580]  i was just crazy enough to go on air and talk about it and make films and aggressively
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:51.980]  prosecute an info war when we have caused you have caused the real muscle of this operation

[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:36.540]  it's a good feeling it's sick when you look at how evil the enemy is and how twisted
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.780]  how dishonorable they are but i've just got to control myself and not look too closely i've
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.340]  got to just coldly look at what they're doing analyze it and resist it and then have my passion
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.820]  for victory and feel good i've got to get my my morale up even though because we're having a lot
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:56.140]  of victories but i just they're so sickening and so degenerate and such a joke and so weak

[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:31.020]  certain level and so i get mad that they make me fight them i get mad they make me sit here and
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.900]  savagely attack them and and just engage in vicious information warfare against them
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:42.780]  and just push them and attack them and bite them and and and because believe it they come right back
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:48.060]  at us folks and i just it's just i just cannot stand them i mean that's really what it comes down to

[01:04:50.700 --> 01:05:00.700]  other uh key reports here i have some criticism of the police and their policies the orlando mass
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:06.860]  murderer who targeted homosexuals was a regular at the pulse nightclub reports the london guardian
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:11.660]  customers had seen the killer there before and several reported getting messages from him
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:18.220]  on gay dating apps the fbi is investigating that claim one patron said sometimes he would go over
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.740]  in the corner and sit and drink by himself and other times he would get so drunk he was loud
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:29.020]  and belligerent we didn't really talk to him a lot but i remember him saying things about his dad
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:36.860]  at times he told us he had a wife and child jim van horn age 71 told the associated press of matine
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:42.380]  he was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men he would walk up to them and then maybe put
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:47.820]  his arm around them or something that's what people do at gay bars i think it's possible that he was

[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:58.300]  report dot com hacker releases secret clinton docks from the state department dnc trump
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.980]  opposition file donor lists and i've looked at it it looks accurate and so far at least as of this
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:09.820]  morning they're saying that uh they believe it's real this is guzifer 2.0 uh some are claiming
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.220]  that it's the russians well i just say more power to them because it was the russians that exposed
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:19.100]  the carbon tax fraud with over a thousand universities coordinating with each other to
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:24.300]  quote high the decline in temperature in the last seven years and that was six years ago
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:29.900]  so that's coming up and we're about to play a clip video 16-year-old black trump supporter
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:36.620]  schools leftist black lives matter ding dong uh dallas police department is practicing riot control
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:46.940]  ahead of donald trump's visit so we're going to have reporters up there uh tonight covering that
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.580]  event and in my experience when i've had anti-fellow reserve rallies and things we've had more
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:10:00.300]  opposition from leftist in dallas than i've even gotten in denver colorada and new york city
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:05.980]  or san antonio or houston because i've protested the fed at all those places the private run for
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:12.620]  private fed i mean i've had them really come after us in dallas so privately i had a bet in
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:18.940]  here and i'll just say it now uh with tim kennedy that that i was like no i don't think san antonio
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:24.860]  is where it's going to happen of course trump canceled that it's going to be dallas and i'm
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.060]  not saying it's going to be that out of control because the dallas police are pretty serious
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.140]  they didn't mess with us too much
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:39.980]  when we had our jfk event for the 40th anniversary because they banned protesting the city had but
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:45.020]  i still went and demanded to do it and threatened to sue but then they called in the county to attack
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:49.260]  us that's that's you know famous video for no reason i mean the police were leaving us alone at
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.860]  a federal reserve demonstration then they came and this lady came and said you can't protest without
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.940]  a permit i said i'm gonna do it she was the riot police are coming and i said we've already been
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:02.140]  out here two hours everybody let's just leave we just showed you on video doing that and again
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:07.020]  i'm not out to get the police themselves i don't just hate the police but leave the first amendment
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.980]  alone leave the second alone and when you get orders to violate it don't go along with it i mean
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:16.220]  all over the country i watch leftist groups black lives matter you name an attack police
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.220]  and they're ordered to stand there and take it because these these cities are run by a bunch of
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:26.860]  globalist but then we're trying to get permits in cleveland officially with roger stone and we
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.460]  have that group coming on next hour they want me to be an added plaintiff the lawsuit and i am
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:35.020]  going to be and they're just saying oh you can have a couple hours you know twice over miles away
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:40.300]  where nobody can see in a free speech zone well no we're going to sue you so you know a lot of
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.660]  times the police are put in the middle of this though and the police will say well go change it
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:49.340]  or sue the city or you know go to city council we're just following orders yeah but nuremberg
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:56.620]  the nuremberg precept at a certain point you got to say no just like the military said no
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.140]  four and a half years ago to aiding al-qaeda it was just too much we're not giving them
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.420]  stinger missiles we're not giving them toe missiles we know you've already done it we
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:09.660]  know about bin ghazi we're not doing this so that's what's going to save us is saying no and then
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:14.620]  they can't just target one good cop or one good soldier at a certain point all of us have to say
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:19.340]  no i've said no you think i want to go march up about you know against the police when they're
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.100]  saying no protest and get arrested i've been arrested three times doing it though because
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:29.820]  the first amendment is important but here's a bad example this is out of arlington voice
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.740]  but the good news is it's the police exposing it
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:40.940]  union police union exposes department's long denied quota system i love how all these departments
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:46.220]  deny quotas and then they've got quotas unwritten or written you get promoted when you write more
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.740]  tickets and i don't care if you write tickets of real drunk drivers or arrest them or somebody
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.100]  really speeding or whatever but when you're just got some old lady pulled over and her
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.100]  stickers out and you write her three tickets or you harass you know the 18 wheelers because they
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.100]  had dust on their bumper or whatever i mean the truck police are the ones that are really
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:06.860]  just just destroying a lot of lives and basically are the equivalent of pirates out there just
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:12.460]  revenue generating an arlington police union is exposing the department's informal quota system
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:16.220]  after 15 patrol officers were placed on administrative leave for inflating traffic
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:20.300]  stop data internal emails and documents i mean you think cops really just want to pull you over
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:24.860]  give me tickets folks they don't internal emails and documents released by the arlington municipal
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:29.660]  patrolman's association is shedding light on the department's use of informal quota based
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:35.340]  performance systems to withhold privileges from underperforming officers so good for the officers
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:41.340]  and that's what you need see i said it's a bad story about police it's bad about the leadership
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:48.460]  it's good for the grass roots police they've got plenty of real crimes to investigate the justice
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:53.500]  system needs to be going in there with huge fines against criminals that commit crimes against
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:14:00.540]  property and things don't give a lady a hundred dollar ticket for their stickers out a month somebody
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:05.900]  that robs a car go bust the chop shop put them all in jail seize all of it take their houses
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:13.580]  when you've convicted them but they don't do that they just plea bargain and then the guys the cop
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:21.340]  the the the chop shop if they even get in trouble get probation so the revenue generating has to
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:26.620]  stop so so that's a good story because it shows how these paradigms are complex it's bad the police
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:30.940]  are doing this but nine times out of ten whether it's houston or whether it's new york i see these
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:36.060]  stories it's the police exposing that the crime labs corrupt it's the police exposing that they're
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:41.500]  ordered to go out remember for years ago the police union in york said look we're ordered to give old
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:48.060]  ladies tickets for sitting more than five minutes on a park bench we're ordered to uh just totally
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:53.420]  harass people everybody hates us now we don't want to do this and so they had to start backing off of
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.980]  that and that's an example of how about the police can put unique pressure on government itself
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:02.860]  but the globalist with this whole divide and conquer strategy and this strong city union
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.860]  initiative don't want the citizens to ever interface with the police or real community
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:12.540]  to they want to be the un and the local socialist organizations and the black lives matter george
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:19.660]  soros ford foundation groups coming in bullying the departments terrorizing them exacerbating crises
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.620]  scapegoating all governmental problems on the police and sheriff's departments so they then
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:30.940]  become totally political and go under leftist control and then boy once that happens you get a
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:38.060]  chicago a new york a dc a total hellhole every time these people will wreck your society socialist
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:43.660]  when they get control of the police department it is a living hell and police departments know this
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:50.140]  and then you get political police that sit there and laugh while the social justice warriors beat
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:57.740]  you up now i've got some concern about donald trump and i rarely do but a lot of times it's
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:02.860]  because he's super smart but sometimes he doesn't fully understand some technical subjects or he's
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:07.660]  causing a debate for political purposes he's sly like a fox but he put out a tweet and i'll cover
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:13.100]  in the next segment where he said i'm gonna be meeting with the nra to see what homeland security
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:17.980]  owners are calling for me here's a tweet i'll be meeting with the nra who has endorsed me about
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:24.380]  not allowing people on terrorist watch lists or the no fly list to buy guns now that that is that
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:30.460]  a neutral statement or does it kind of sound like he's going to be meeting with them about a not
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:35.900]  allowing people on the terror watch list or the no fly list to buy guns it sounds like he's saying
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:40.940]  he's going to be meeting with them about asking for that it's not clear it's ambiguous but it leans
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:49.340]  60 40 towards that so donald trump needs to get educated on this or he's to clarify what he's
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:54.940]  saying i don't know which it is because this ends the process and the nra came back and said
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:17:00.860]  we support due process systems if someone's on a fly list having that flagged in the nix system
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:06.140]  but not denying it of you if there's not any credible threat or indictment or investigation
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.060]  we need due process is what the nra said they're absolutely right this will end due process and
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:18.700]  allow putting gun owners on these no gun buy lists it's a very very serious situation it's a holy
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.940]  grail they've been pushing for for eight years and so i hope trump clarifies that he shoots out a lot
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.860]  of tweets uh we'll certainly find out but i'm going to shoot a special message later today
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:32.220]  after the show just to donald trump on this subject of the no fly list and i know it gets to him
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:37.100]  to try to give him a briefing on the subject uh or perhaps i'm wrong and he just i'm
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.940]  misinterpreting this and he needs to clarify uh we're going to go to break but but first i want
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:44.860]  to just play now this chicari jackson clipper part of it will play more when he joins us the

[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:23.180]  leave the euro the brixit and she was terminated watch it'll be some mentally ill person on ssri

[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:35.100]  see uh she was at a public event and she was shot and stabbed oh there's like a total gun man in the
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:51.260]  uk but magically the anti-e you labor member of parliament executed with a gun in gun free jolly
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:56.940]  old england i mean what is the headline on that british lawmaker killed in shock attack ahead of
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:06.140]  the v u vote oh shock attack the globalist mean business you know today i came on the start of
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:16.780]  the broadcast with this five-shot four ten with triple hot buck handgun and i walked in
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:27.900]  to my concealed carry crew and said it's always important for everybody to be armed didn't it
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:35.900]  but oh she was safe in england they have basically a gun ban what is it less than one tenth of one
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:42.620]  percent of the population has shooting clubs where shotguns and hunting rifles are held and you go
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:47.420]  in the hunt master lets you get your gun out and then you all go out and you hunt and they'll now
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:53.100]  usually have to have a sheriff or someone along with you all because of a couple mass shootings
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:27:02.700]  they had there it's not that bad in australia but close and now she's dead so anti-e you
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:10.460]  member of parliament executed ahead of e you vote that's your headline in fact
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:19.100]  put that earlier headline up they got it anti-e you member of parliament executed ahead of
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:29.420]  rigs it vote that is simply amazing in fact the headline i'm gonna go with it on this is exactly
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.220]  of that other headline you guys put that back on screen if you those headlines you just had
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.820]  again for tv viewers radio listeners go to info wars dot com forward slash show
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:40.700]  yeah i'd say yahoo news got the headline right british lawmaker killed in shock attack ahead of
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:53.740]  e you vote you know i would just say this um leading voice calling for exit from e you executed
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:59.420]  ahead of vote oh there's nothing suspicious here kind of like what happened with scalia everything's
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:05.180]  fine everything's wonderful everything's okay everybody go back to sleep this is so sad and
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:09.740]  they've been executing nationalists all over the e you'd usually muslims come up and shoot them or
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:15.980]  kill them even though when they're not anti-muslim it just that's usually the executor the executioner
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.620]  a little lined up toy because their email will be controlled by the globalist and then the message
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:25.740]  goes down to hot beep you know that he needs to tell his flock that this person needs to die and
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:32.060]  then they die oh they die because see islam is natural mind control and i'm not saying this guy's
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:36.540]  gonna be a muslim i'm just saying a lot of cases it is because it's so cultural it's so controlling
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:40.380]  it's all about dying it's all about you know you know doing whatever you have to it's all about
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.340]  never getting along with anybody basically i mean i got articles here today in afghanistan
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:52.300]  where they have sex slaves little girls that are muslims that they just grab and force to go out
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:55.340]  and lure in other muslims to kill them they're all just killing each other
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:29:02.940]  this is crazy paul joseph watson will be on at 45 after jacari jackson's coming in right after
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:08.700]  this break talking about social justice warriors but there's the headline taliban uses honey trap
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:14.620]  boys yeah little boys too not just little girls to kill afghan police uh because pedophilia and
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:20.860]  and homosexuality is so ubiquitous in muslim countries especially afghanistan they send out
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:29.180]  little boys to lure them to their deaths but just like the you know this afghan immigrant his parents
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:36.140]  are from there cia brought them in admittedly he goes hangs out he's on the gay apps but then
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:41.740]  he separately goes and kills them because see it's okay when he does it was as long as he kills them
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:50.860]  later i mean this is just a mental patient cult of total screwballs we're on the march the empires
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:30:03.180]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network everyone obama and trump as well as the nra and
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:08.140]  lgbt lobbyists are saying the orland of shooting requires new gun control measures because it's
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:13.980]  now an issue of national security democrats in congress just ended a 15 hour filibuster
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:19.020]  republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:25.100]  labeled a terrorist remember this is secretly and without trial people are put on terror watch lists
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:30.060]  and no fly watch lists without their knowledge without being told of the charges against them
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:36.060]  without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury now we're going to apply
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:41.180]  punishments and sanctions against them this is a star chamber process that the bill of rights
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:46.940]  was written to stop terror attacks are not a gun control issue they're a border control issue
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:51.740]  without background checks for migrants terrorists are free to use nuclear biological or chemical

[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:24.380]  shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas the first reports say that
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:32.620]  president kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.460]  it was almost as if you were a planned influence to judge bank
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:48.700]  case either you were with us or you were with the terrorists
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:04.860]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not

[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:30.300]  just living and dying for what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:37.420]  we're live live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.220]  we have paul watson joining us in about 10 minutes chicari jackson's will be riding shotgun with us
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:47.580]  for the rest of the hour to talk about social justice wars and some of the amazing footage
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.780]  he got out of Atlanta in other areas the last few days it's now going viral
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:56.860]  but the first reports came out five minutes ago about this labor mp joe cox died that were being
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:03.260]  shot and stabbed and some of the first reports were that she was pro bricks because most of the
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:09.340]  labor party is pro exiting the euro because even liberals realize that you shouldn't have an
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:14.780]  unelected group controlling your nation but reportedly we have her tweets she actually
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:19.500]  said immigration is not legitimate concern but it's not a good reason to leave the EU again
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:23.100]  immigration is a legitimate concern but it's not a good reason to leave the EU so she was
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:28.700]  uh reportedly on the fence or or or pro europe and that now they're saying and these are 10
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:34.700]  of reports just now coming out that whoever shot and stabbed her in the gun free zone of the uk uh
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:42.300]  screamed you know uh don't stay in the bricks it when he attacked her so is this a false flag
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:49.740]  to try to turn the polls against the uk leaving the unelected EU or is it someone really mad
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:55.980]  about the fact that the foreign power has occupied their nation i'm not pushing for violence and i
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:00.620]  think this will backfire if it was someone who was misguided and were sad for her family but
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:05.740]  you know the french were occupied by the germans this is a political occupation but still nevertheless
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:10.940]  that's what's happening and so it's very very similar to the vici french so to a certain point
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:15.820]  if they do take all the delegates from bernie sanders and give it to hillary do people have
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.700]  a right to get upset and angry i'm not saying they should do that at this point but at at at
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:26.060]  what point when they start picking the candidates for us what do we do i want to put bookends on
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:32.860]  this until watson joins us but we'll also ask jacari jackson's uh view on that now before i go any
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:38.620]  further uh here today we're running a special because tim kennedy one of the top soldiers in
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:44.620]  the u.s military is now an analyst and a reporter for info wars dot com and so we're very excited
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:48.460]  about the fact he's been doing a lot of special reports and uh productions for us all over the
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:53.580]  world in between hunting hitler and all the other things he's doing he's got a movie that he helped
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:58.860]  produce that's premiering on 800 movie screens range 15 tonight as well a lot of actors i really
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:05.580]  like like william shatner and others but that's a side issue uh tim kennedy's game changer 15
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:10.540]  percent off the three products he loves and that's super male vitality also super female vitality goes
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:18.300]  for that uh brain force and of course the secret 12 vitamin b 12 organic sublingual drops all of
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:25.500]  those together 15 percent off or by themselves 15 off at info wars life dot com or by calling toll
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:29.900]  three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine that's triple eight two five three three
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:34.220]  one three nine and the money we make from this obviously makes everything we're doing here possible
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.780]  we want to get a few more reporters a few more editors video people uh and crew so we can really
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:43.500]  always have crews out there like in dallas today for the trump rally coming up at seven o'clock

[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:31.180]  what jacari jackson has been covering he just got back from in lana georgia uh really got a whole
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:38.060]  bunch of amazing videos that are going viral right now that really just tell us more of the same story
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:46.060]  over and over again that the black lives matter groups the the bernie sanders groups the liberal
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:51.980]  groups the socialist groups it's just like the mark dice videos or the videos we shoot in austin
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:59.420]  i'm sorry you go to a supposed liberal area a university area they a lot of times don't even
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:05.740]  know what planet they're on and they really are angry and feel wronged and will run up particularly
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:11.180]  to quote minorities a lot of white people do this to hispanics or black folks and say what are you
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:17.100]  doing here he's racist he's bad he's evil even if you don't like donald trump they've been misrepresenting
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:22.620]  what he really says and what he does and jacari got footage of arrests that were made uh just all
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:26.540]  sorts of stuff there in atlanta we're gonna have again two of our reporters up there tonight in
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:31.100]  dallas will have live feeds on the nightly news seven o'clock central find it tells them fours
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:36.620]  dot com forward slash show but jacari before we play a few minutes of this 10 minute viral video
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:40.220]  obviously there's a lot when you're out there with a camera that people don't see what is your
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:45.180]  sense of covering these events well with this one in particular it was a much calmer event i know we
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:49.740]  showed some of the footage of the arrest right there but this can pay us in comparison to some
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:53.500]  place like albuquerque where people were lighting fires and throwing barricades and all you got hit
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.820]  and have the rock yeah i got hit in the head with a rock so this was a much calmer crowd as a much
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:02.540]  smaller crowd as well if you take away all the journalists i'd say there are maybe three or
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:06.780]  four hundred people there at any given time as opposed to some place like albuquerque or anaheim
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:12.700]  where you had thousands so it was a much calmer situation but timbers did flare and that's some
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.420]  of the footage that we have coming up uh this one thing in particular it was a conversation between
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:22.300]  an older gentleman and a younger guy i think the younger guy was about 16 or so and he was a
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:27.020]  trump supporter young black man and the older guy comes up to him he says you're a disgrace
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:31.020]  and i run into this a lot when we went out to albuquerque there's a similar thing where
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:35.020]  latinos were yelling at each other you're not you know a real latino if you support donald trump
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:38.540]  and they're saying a similar thing to this young black man saying that you're not a real black person
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.940]  if you support donald trump now i wasn't don't support any of these candidates it was like
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:46.540]  you don't support donald trump but you have to support hilary and i'm like why would i want to
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:51.660]  support hilary uh miss saying she wants to go out and put hot sauce on all of her food you know
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:56.060]  very racist statements like that completely ridiculous but he was very convinced that
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.340]  hillary clinton was the person for the nation uh even to the point where they criticized trump and
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.340]  as you were mentioning there alex if you want to criticize the guy there's legitimate ways to do it
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:10.300]  but when you say that trump wants to send black people back to africa i have never heard him say
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:14.220]  or even a lose oh by the way i wanted to play this clip for over a month two weeks i keep
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:17.340]  forgetting to play it it's the little jewish kids can you guys pull up the brainwash kids
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:23.260]  club for later where they just keep saying i'm jewish and he hates jews i mean have you ever
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:28.860]  heard trump say send africans to africa no and that's what they these people do they'll take
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:34.460]  a grain of truth where he says he wants to send people who came here illegally keyword illegally
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:39.500]  back to their homelands or whatever and you can have your feelings about that but the issue is they
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:44.860]  so stress this out of proportion even when they talk about uh hispanics coming into the country
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:49.020]  they say he wants to send all hispanics back to mexico well number one they're not all from mexico
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:53.020]  beyond that he didn't say he wants to send them back if they came here legally if they've been
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:56.860]  here legally and he said make a faster path for him to legally come here yeah you can't just say
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.900]  we can pitch like the 30 40 million people you're just legal now and that's what these guys don't
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:07.260]  understand and the guy in the video had clearly no understanding of immigration policy to the point
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:11.500]  where he's talking about trump's wife needs to go back to wherever she's from and people saying
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:16.700]  she came here legally there's a way to legally well that's another thing about trump his family
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:22.220]  is married to people from all over the world age asian folks you name it he has a one of the highest
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:25.980]  levels of putting quote minorities and women in executive positions that's why he's got so many
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:28.860]  people that actually work for him coming out and defending him and people have looked at the numbers
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:35.100]  it's true so the truth is when it comes to this they're totally making it up and they're trying to
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:40.140]  basically just play on people's ignorance hoping they don't know what trump really said and but
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:45.500]  but another thing is this older gentleman that's yelling at the young a trump supporter he's got
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:50.380]  a rainbow flag on he's speaking with a list i mean he looks like you know he's a classic
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:55.500]  effeminate gay man i don't know i'm just speculating but he's wearing a rainbow flag probably is
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:43:00.860]  and you just saw 49 gay people murdered trump is out there saying this is terrible this is
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:05.420]  horrible you shouldn't attack people for their sexual preferences the muslim leaders are are
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:10.780]  not apologizing he's not mad at them he's mad at trump he just doesn't seem to get it that's
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:15.740]  absolutely hit the nail on the head right there alex i ran into so many people out there who were
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:21.180]  saying or basically blaming trump for what happened in orlando i'm like how is that trump's fault
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:25.100]  that a person took it upon himself to go into a gay bar and kill people wait a minute wait a
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:30.460]  minute i haven't seen those videos yet you've got video where they blame trump for orlando this is
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.220]  just people walking around talk god i wish you had that a lot because i've seen that in emails and
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:39.260]  she comments but they i want to ask him he's the guy that's trying to stop this i wow you actually
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:43.820]  heard that yeah these are opinions of people they they want to blame him for everything everything
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:48.620]  is this man's fault oh i see people on albuquerque blaming the economy on him yeah and i'm like the
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:52.060]  guy's not even he's not even a politician he's never even been in office i was like how's that
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:57.420]  his i mean these these guys we went out to albuquerque uh these uh 20 year old or whatever uh uh
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.820]  bernie supporters they were blaming this guy donald trump for things that have been going on
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:06.380]  their entire lifetimes and the man's just now becoming a politician how is any of this stuff
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:10.380]  donald trump's fault that's what's incredible or hate him you're blaming him for stuff that he has
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:14.220]  nothing to do with i've got a concern with him putting this tweet out to the nr a saying he
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:19.180]  wants to talk to them about banning people from having guns there are no fly lists that if he's
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:25.260]  saying that uh do you think i'm misinterpreting that tweet or uh cold text is not the easiest
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:30.940]  things interpret you know so we can wait and see what he actually has to clarify he i would say i
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.020]  would behoove him to to clarify that statement are you gonna be concerned if he does want to
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:39.820]  just randomly ban people absolutely because we you and i both know this alex that we've seen
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:43.900]  multiple times that young children being put on the no fly list miss not because they themselves
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:48.140]  are on the list but they have a similar name to somebody who does but if you have this not just
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:53.420]  no fly no buy but you extend that to all walks of life now let's say some the 15 year old or the
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:57.820]  five year old boy scout when he becomes 18 he wants to join the military he's a military
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:01.660]  aids male on a no fly list you think they're going to let them in sure it's an extra judicial
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:05.740]  list and the and even the nr a said hey we're looking at ways to do this where it follows
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.020]  due process this is the end of due process available do it speaking of the brainwashing
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:16.620]  clip here are jewish children saying donald trump hates jews when his daughter is married to
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:21.260]  i mean multiple members of family are married to jews i mean this is just the biggest load of bull
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:32.700]  here it is
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:46:02.380]  that's enough i can't play the whole thing
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:07.260]  it's up on info wars dot com now now now here's a lot about the anti-semite groups that say the
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:11.660]  jews are all one big brain all you know agree with each other these are hardcore liberal jews
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:17.500]  who literally are the main people wanting to bring in radical muslims who whether which
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:24.620]  side of this year on i'm not on either do kill each other and particularly arabs killing jews
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:29.340]  and these little kids are going donald trump is mean to the muslims and he's mean to the jews
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:35.020]  it's all just total made-up garbage but here are the jews teaching their jewish children
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:41.580]  that donald trump wants to hurt them but the muslims love them i mean the left particularly
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:47.980]  leftist jews are the most brainwashed crazy people i've ever seen in my life they are the most self
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:53.900]  loving nuts and then i see the white supremacist going i've fallen a banana pill a jew did it and
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:57.580]  i go there's a bunch of different groups of jews how do you sit there and say there's one group
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:02.620]  there's like seven or eight major you know bodies of different jewish political thought and then
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:06.540]  there's so many other groups of individuals you can't even say it's like it's just labeling
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:11.180]  you're black jacar you got to support hillary or or or i'm white i got to support trump i mean
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:16.060]  what does this even mean it's just so dumb down what do you make of that club it's very shocking
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:20.700]  but honestly i've seen things like that when i go onto the streets this is very uh what i've
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:26.460]  heard referred to as the hive mindset because you're you know x whether that's race religion whatever
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:30.460]  else you can like this person or you can't like that person and that's pretty much what we continue
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.900]  wow we're going to break i'm going to come back with two segments with paul watson and jacar
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:38.620]  irate shotgun on this investigation first the news was saying she might have been for the

[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:40.380]  that's what he's saying he says that messica's back to mexico you you are you should you are
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:45.580]  displaced to america thank you for being a young black man supporting a racist thank you thank you

[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:02.220]  that you're not a real black man you can't be a black man if you support somebody like donald
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:08.940]  he says that's the messica's back to mexico no he said don't let muslims hear yeah he said why
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:12.700]  he's are you going to talk are you going to yell no i'm telling you because that's what it is they
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:16.860]  don't want you to talk they just want to yell at you he doesn't want any type of real debate any
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:20.700]  type of real discussion with this young man he just wants to yell at him these talking thoughts
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:27.260]  that he's been convinced of by whoever which is completely false well a racist him send messica
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:33.980]  back to mexico mexico deports almost everybody i i don't get it we have like one of the most
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:40.700]  open things in the world he's saying we're evil i would have loved to ask him why are you wearing
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:44.620]  that rainbow flag and hating trump i bet he would have said trump did it well you said people are
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:50.620]  saying trump's default for orlando trump's fault it is for everything if you get in a car wreck
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:50:06.860]  today it's donald trump's fault you're probably like 30 something but that's fine
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:11.340]  that's fine thank you go listen to him yeah i love how the young man's trying to talk to him
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:22.220]  he's like a teenager he's 16 and then you got this guy just completely angry
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:34.860]  and of course you can ask him why does trump have record numbers of black supporters compared to
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:39.660]  other republican candidates but usually republicans get 10 percent he's got like 25 in polls
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:45.420]  and i love this lady there wasn't her two cents he does that's it you know white people too so
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:48.860]  yeah i'm going to skip this break just this one today i just can't help it
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:55.180]  again jacari describe this for for for radio listeners exactly where you are in alana so
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:51:00.380]  where this is this is the fox theater in alana georgia that this is put it from yesterday
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:05.900]  and it's a crowd of maybe three to four hundred people there at any given time and uh particularly
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:10.620]  what this is this is a lady who's now joining to the debate and she's arguing with not just the
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:13.740]  the younger man the 16 year old but also his friends his high school friends
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:23.340]  that's very vague that's it's very sad i'm very sad i work for a president twice okay the one of
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:27.580]  the worst gods ever but okay oh yeah one of the worst guys ever let's look at the condition of our
[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:34.860]  country it's like a cult they all just say the same stupid stuff it is they get the same talking
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:43.900]  points from wherever and they just repeat them as if they're gospel history of his grandmother and
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:52.460]  father they were kk members what yeah now listen to us what he says the young boy go go google go google
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:59.100]  he says you google but i mean that would be all over the news if that was okay oh yeah i don't know
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:04.540]  where these guys get this information i would come back and say hillary was brought into politics
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:12.540]  by grand dragon yeah and i was like he she went to a kkk funeral who's my class man kkk who's to
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:18.460]  get your color okay nothing about uh the claims in the dixie mothi i think the democratic party
[01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:23.820]  founded a kkk by the way just saying let me tell you what i'm gonna do is i love it i love it i love
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:30.380]  it i love it i'm for the people okay that's good it's good it's quite the same we'll never be defeated
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:34.700]  and that's what i believe we should we should take this footage and put over at her with the plan and
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:40.380]  just show all the stuff i mean yeah you do a lot of stuff with it i mean oh this is amazing not like
[01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:44.380]  yours doesn't mean he's not trying to we got carl the cock we got aid screelix we got triglypuff what
[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:49.580]  would this guy's name be rainbow dummy i don't know the best of names but i'm sure somebody
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:53:03.500]  will come up with something i think triglypuff is probably my favorite name
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:07.820]  yeah he's just how that was before you can't bring people in now and have welfare and infrastructure
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:11.740]  and give it away free or you collapse people weren't getting welfare 300 years ago coming
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:16.220]  here it was hell on earth and everybody just keeps living in the past man i tell you this is crazy
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:20.780]  all right full videos up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com jacarjax and riding shotgun
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:27.500]  with us we now shift gears to labor mp member of parliament joe cox has died at her being shot three
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:33.740]  times in the street near her office by an attacker who shouted britain first then kicked her while she
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:38.460]  lay bleeding and the first reports were because she was in labor that she was probably for the
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:44.220]  british exit or the brexit but but now they're saying no no she was forced staying in the EU
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:48.860]  and that he reportedly yelled uh shouted britain first and kicked her while she was
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:52.540]  lay bleeding and stabbed her the big question is how do you get a gun and a gun for his own
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:57.260]  what are they going to turn this into oh you got to stay in the unelected EU now because somebody
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:02.700]  got shot this is developing quick but paul watson always seems to have the answers on this paul
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:09.980]  joseph watson from london england paul what have you learned well first of all she is a left-wing
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:16.540]  politician she's for the remain campaign but the truth about this is this so-called shout of britain
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:21.740]  first seems like it's complete bs they've gone back and asked the eyewitnesses who have said
[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:27.900]  that he didn't say britain first now it's the merge that he's mentally ill he was on medication
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:33.020]  i predicted that i predicted that in the first second exactly and he didn't shout anything
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:37.900]  political before he attacked and killed her but you know it doesn't really matter to the left
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:42.940]  this is the not all muslims crowd after every single islamist terror attack they come out and say
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:48.620]  don't blame all muslims but immediately within minutes you could go on twitter they were all
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:54.620]  blaming conservatives people who want to get out of the EU lumping everybody in with him
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.900]  am i wrong in saying that a lot of labor people actually want to get out too now though i mean
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:03.740]  even the mayor of london for a lot of people with a lot of people within labor including the leader
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:12.060]  of labor but he won't campaign on it do want to leave the EU but again the eyewitnesses are now
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:18.060]  coming out and saying that this claim that the killer shouted britain first is not true yet
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:23.260]  still people are all over twitter claiming it is the other angle to it is that i mean i predicted
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:28.620]  this i've i tweet so much i can't even find the tweet anymore but i've said it many times
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:33.820]  as the thunder rose outside you said two weeks ago there'll be some event on this show uh some type
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:39.420]  of terror attack or something so they can you know make people that are uh against uh leaving look
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:45.100]  like terrorists yeah and um charlie skeleton who you had on last week predicted it as well he said
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:50.140]  i'll not be surprised if the big noisy security terror scare just pre referendum that's best
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:53.980]  dealt with by the uk being in the EU which of course they're going to blame it on people who
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:59.180]  want to leave the EU the article i've got up on informers.com right now goes through that some
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:02.620]  of the examples oh well you already wrote an article in the last 30 minutes well let's put it up on
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:06.460]  screen right now for tv viewers and radio listeners paul joseph watson has an article out and i'll let
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:10.780]  you go quick so you can add more to it but wow so so there's so the witnesses are saying didn't say
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:14.380]  this this stinks to high heaven because they usually have some mentally ill wind up toy
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:19.180]  so there's a leftist so they bring in to do it to create the sympathy and and then basically
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:24.620]  you add the political statements later the political establishment will exploit the murder of joe cox
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:32.380]  to kill brexit not all muslims crowd will blame the vote leave conservatives for shooting mp good
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:38.380]  point paul yeah i mean here's a quote from somebody prominent on twitter these brexit
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:43.740]  hardliners are getting out of control my thoughts go out to joe cox's family and friends there are
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:49.100]  others who are talking about this is the responsibility of people who want to limit immigration into the
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:55.420]  into the united kingdom like having a problem with 330 000 people coming in every single year
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:01.020]  means you sympathize with some mentally ill person who's just killed an mp and by the way we know the
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:05.260]  numbers are higher than that paul but i want to say this just like they've stolen the delegates
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:10.860]  from ernie sanders when they really start canceling elections when when is the point you can physically
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.100]  resist i mean i'm not saying that she should have gotten killed i think it's terrible but but i mean
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:19.580]  the french were occupied by farm power if you're occupied by an unelected e you that you didn't
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:25.180]  vote to enter at what point are you not allowed to stand up and say no i mean to use the slave
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:29.260]  analogy say you know 200 years ago in this country or whatever i'd just say i'm not a slave and beat
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:34.700]  your brains out i mean at at what point does it start getting too violent to carrie i don't know
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:40.940]  but uh it's definitely sad of this young lady or this prime minister lost her life uh and we'll
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:45.420]  just see what what develops absolutely but i mean my point is i'm not saying there should be any violence
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:51.900]  but at a certain point if you're on even unelected government is over you what do you do to resist that
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:57.100]  just stop complying non-violently that's that's a start yeah and that's what martin was a king did
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:06.140]  yeah paul what do you think about that angle well i mean it's difficult to not comply when you can't

[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:21.980]  jones i'll be looking for aid when they start jackson's riding shotgun well this is the rest of
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:27.740]  this segment so is paul watson i was kind of ranting last last segment but speaking of free
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:32.460]  speech they're trying to ban our free speech uh and say you can't have a trump rally and so we've
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:36.380]  got the organizers of that joining us talk about that in the next segment that ties into all this
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:41.660]  you know mahogany's march to the sea that was successful against the british being nonviolent
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:46.460]  but they stopped paying the salt tax and other things so there's got to be some non-compliance and
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:54.300]  paul where does this go if the british exiting the eu the brexit fails or do you think that
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:01:00.140]  they'll cheat i mean what are the tea leaves saying well the polls over the past week have been
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:05.740]  you know pro-leave they've swung the opposite way at one point they swung 13 points the other way
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:10.300]  there's a poll out today where vote leave is four points ahead so they differ but they're all in
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:15.500]  favor of vote leave compared to a month or so ago six weeks ago when they were all in favor of vote
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:23.580]  remain they'll actually go out and vote because they're psychologically averse to change that's
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:28.620]  what the establishment relies on people freaking out and not voting for change when it actually
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:33.820]  can you think scotland really voted to stay in well it was very close and there were some
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:38.300]  shenanigans with that but what's even more concerning is mp's are people
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:48.220]  noises to the fact that even if the british people vote to leave europe they will ignore the vote
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:52.060]  like the eu has done in many different countries and they will simply say
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:02:00.220]  debate whether we want to leave in parliament another vote another vote another vote just
[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:05.500]  like ireland you know absolutely it's just incredible what does your gut tell you about
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:12.460]  next week that they will exit or they won't exit i'm more hopeful over the past week because the
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:18.700]  polls are showing that vote leave is is pulling ahead but you know i think they'll pull something
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:23.500]  i think they'll pull another stunt even though now it's just come out that this killer had quote
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:28.620]  no political views he said nothing about the eu referendum doesn't matter to the left they
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:33.340]  will still frame everybody in this same extremist they will still just say it well how do you get
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:41.500]  a gun when it's nearly impossible to get one there i managed to get one so those gun control
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:46.140]  laws didn't work because criminals don't obey laws surprise surprise that's right you know i'm
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:50.620]  i'm more hopeful than i was a month ago about brexit let's just put it that way we've got the
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:55.980]  momentum if we continue to carry that forward it's it's going to be a vote leave absolutely paul
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:59.100]  you're going to be hosting some coming up next week so let's check your skype it's having some
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:04.460]  hiccups great job thank you thanks alex thank you skype's great but i tell you it's got some problems
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:08.380]  jacar we got two minutes left other thoughts just about the selection where the world's going right
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:13.260]  now well we look at the person who just got killed today and it also reminds me of the person who
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:18.060]  got killed a camera for us earlier this week or last week the policeman and his wife who got stabbed
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:23.420]  overseas and france yeah in france and these things make international news when it's a big
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:27.500]  politician or a police officer but these things happen every single day but they won't tell you
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.780]  about some housewife who got stabbed to death or you know some kid at a bus stop you know who got
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:37.180]  slashed or stabbed they only want to tell you about you know when uh it's big sensational it's the ar
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:42.540]  15 is something that we can blame that's when it's a news story just like this alligator eating this
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:47.340]  kid i mean it's sad but is it the biggest story in the world no it's sensational and so they can
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:52.220]  it's very it's very unique it's very unique and it's unique it's not going to be unique soon they
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:55.980]  don't start killing some alligators but those things are all over the place now i saw one cross
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:04:00.300]  the highway in south texas my son went out and killed three of them two years ago oh yeah oh yeah
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:04.300]  you can get an alligator how nice this is now he killed a little uh biggest one's 11 feet
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:09.260]  but yeah when we just continue to look at all these things and how they continue to blame people
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:14.060]  as paul was saying they'll blame a group that had nothing to do with a particular incident but now
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:18.220]  it's their fault and i was talking to somebody at the event they don't want to talk on camera but
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:24.140]  in atlanta she was anti-trump because she said that trump was politicizing or taking advantage
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:28.220]  of the orlando shooting to push forward agenda and i said it took hillary 10 minutes to come out
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:32.060]  and blame gun owners like what are you saying that's a complete double standard you know so
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:36.860]  you have to look at these things very objectively and see that these political uh politicals are
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:40.700]  going to take advantage of the situation regardless of what it is they are well great job in atlanta
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:46.780]  we've got our reporters could we send up to dallas i believe it was biggs and kit biggs and kit
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:50.060]  that should be interesting they're on their way up to the trump rally seven o'clock tonight kicks

[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:05.100]  the 2017 national defense authorization act as summarized by the senate arms services committee
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:11.820]  proposes a 25 percent reduction in generals and admirals across the board reports the daily collar
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:17.420]  a summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers also
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:23.980]  applies at the three two and one star levels the committee reasons that over the past 30 years the
[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:30.460]  in strength of the joint force has decreased 38 but the ratio of four star officers to the overall
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:37.180]  force has increased by 65 percent the bill summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the three
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:42.380]  and four star level it can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders the
[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:47.660]  summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction saying that the pentagon must
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:53.180]  proactively work to shift as many personnel as possible from staff functions to operational
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:06:00.940]  and other vital roles you can find more reports at info wars dot com introducing vitamin mineral

[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:04.620]  organizations out there and they've organized in cleveland first stopped the steel demonstration
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:08.060]  but now that they've backed off that at least on the surface they're still going to try and watch
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:13.500]  how the folks come out and just demonstrate with the first amendment and support of the electoral
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:20.060]  process just a free speech rally slash victory rally the dnc is going to be having those oh but
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:25.020]  cleveland's trying to restrict the time and put people miles away the aclu has come out
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:30.540]  and said this is onerous this is wrong and they want folks to sign on who are going to be part of
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:35.180]  a lawsuit and they've asked me to be part of that i'm certainly happy to be a plaintiff in that i
[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:39.900]  tend to be there it's a rally that i started organizing six months ago with roger stone
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:46.860]  so tim is working on that after he leaves us i'm going to get into the latest on russia says it
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:53.820]  might now or nato says it might now have grounds to attack russia we've got more publications
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:58.060]  coming out saying repeal the second amendment not just rolling stone we have hackers release
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:03.020]  secret clinton docks from state department dnc's trump opposition filed donor list
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:09.660]  we have uh just a lot of really important news we're going to be getting to trump may launch
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:14.060]  his own cable network to counter all this well you know they're going to try to send in the
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:17.260]  federal elections commission and claim that that's political speech you can't have it
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.900]  but i said a free speech let them have it i mean the globalist always far and interest
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:25.340]  to own media and sit here and bomb bars with political news they just claim it isn't
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:30.380]  i say free for all and we got the sawties and the communist chinese funding hillary i mean
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:35.340]  give me a break he can have a cable network uh here's the article we wrote cleveland to ban
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:41.020]  trump supporters outside rnc democratic city fueling anti-trump protests to make hillary
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:46.540]  look good uh and so uh tim thank you for joining us citizens for trump dot com
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:51.580]  patriotic warriors dot com uh tim what do we need to do to make sure i mean obviously
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:56.620]  everybody should just show up regardless and and and i'm going to be there i'm going to exercise
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:02.140]  my first amendment i mean is that accurate what should we do hey hey thanks for having me on alex
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:09.020]  i appreciate it you bet so yeah i mean again we uh first started out trying to have a rally of
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:15.500]  sorts to protest the rnc uh stealing uh mr trump's nomination and after we seen that uh wasn't going
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:21.100]  to happen of course we just wanted to have a celebratory parade and uh uh in the rally
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:27.660]  but uh unfortunately the city of cleveland not only belated our permits forever in a day um they
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:34.220]  also reissued new parameters of course as you know now as of just the day or so ago they have
[02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:40.300]  approved a bunch of permits funny enough ours isn't on that approval list all of them are leftists
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:44.860]  or communists or anti-trump groups so we're still sitting here even though we're the top
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:50.300]  plaintiff on the lawsuit against the city they haven't even bothered to respond to me personally
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:55.020]  or the law team so at this point uh you know we don't know what we're doing but you're right
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:12:00.460]  a lot of people are still going to show up but unfortunately the city has made three convergent
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:06.380]  points that are very uh you know i would say are a scenario for violence to happen
[02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:11.180]  well tim it's just incredible uh it's a first amendment issue i know the police are supportive
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:15.980]  yes and then you're gonna have the black you're gonna have the black lives matter group the
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:20.860]  communists the soros groups being able to do whatever they want but here's the rnc trump's
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:27.020]  inside people are trying to organize something outside and they're saying no i hope trump gets
[02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:31.500]  involved in this not just the lawsuit but but let's talk about the technicals the history of this the
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.140]  lawsuit and where it's going and i want to tell viewers and listeners i'm going to be there even
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:41.180]  more now i know as libertarians or conservatives or folks we don't want to go just stir up trouble
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:45.180]  like a bunch of communists but they're violating our rights saying only communists can basically
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:51.660]  march in america we have to take our free speech and our first amendment back yes that's absolutely
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:57.580]  right and you know again with them only approving uh all the left-wing so to speak or anti-trump
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:02.860]  groups at this point one is adding a little bit more validity to our free speech being violated
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:09.100]  and secondarily again it's it's a recipe for disaster you have to understand that these groups
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:14.940]  are coming not you know to peacefully protest they're coming to protest in the same fashion they did
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:21.020]  in california new mexico and in a few other places so we know that the city has taken out a
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:26.780]  massive insurance policy and what does that mean well you know i love the police department and all
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:31.100]  but what it does mean is that no matter what happens there it's going to be covered under that
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:36.700]  uh insurance policy so you know i'm i'm not saying that the police are going to conduct
[02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:41.260]  themselves in any less professional manner but you know there's a big difference when
[02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:45.900]  you're personally responsible and liable for your content as opposed to being covered under a blanket
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:51.020]  insurance policy uh but well there's a big problem here and that clearly they're saying we're going
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:54.700]  to let the leftists run around do whatever they want but but we're not going to allow citizens
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:58.940]  out here that support trump who are the vast majority of people obviously so this is just
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:03.100]  incredible discrimination wow they're arrogant i didn't know about the new development that that
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:07.740]  they've given the permits to all the democrat groups but but not to the pro-trump group that's
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:13.500]  crazy no not you know and again we're the biggest we had the biggest rally plan that that you know
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:18.780]  the uh uh you know the city had seen you know they even told me while it's unheard of the
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:24.220]  plan or a celebratory rally of the size for a you know an r and c event like this but
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:29.580]  but that said it i guess the point i was making earlier is that we can go and show up but understand
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:35.020]  this if we don't get a permit all the leftists will have a permit all of us who are pro-trump
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:39.020]  and you know we represent several certainly obviously we want to get the permit to really
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:43.420]  have everybody together and show it but if not have rolling thunder in take over the streets
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:49.980]  we'll outnumber them five to one and just and just just just it'll be huge yes and we probably
[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:55.900]  would do so but again unfortunately for us is that uh the police will be on the side of the
[02:14:55.900 --> 02:15:01.900]  people with permits if you follow what i'm saying absolutely so we need to try to do this but at the
[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:07.260]  same time that's their problem if the city's corrupt and does that we have to go ahead and go forward
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:12.460]  as you said i've been told the city won't arrest anybody for being in the street specifically they
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:17.260]  won't enforce that but you know that you know remains to be seen but at the end of the day
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:22.620]  i know chuckers for chump bikers for chump tea party or students women for chump a lot of them
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:27.020]  people are still going to come uh you know i know roger's going to be there we're going to be there
[02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:32.140]  five minutes oak we're going to be reporting from inside uh you know the convention as well but
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:35.820]  at the end of the day we you know we we're going to formulate a plan we're going to see we're going
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:40.060]  to give the city a couple more days to see if maybe they're trying to accommodate us and that's a
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:45.020]  delay but i've got a feeling that you're correct they absolutely are going to try to make a mockery
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:50.620]  of us coming one and not allow us to be there legally too well the good news is as you know tim
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:54.540]  they can claim that trump people started the riot in chicago they can claim that trump people did
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:16:00.780]  the stuff in albuquerque or la or wherever all of its bull the internet and real media is bigger
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:05.580]  than the corporate media the establishment media the lies don't work and when it's going to come
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:10.380]  out that the trump people weren't given their permits they weren't given their place they were
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:14.140]  told they could be on the other side of the moon in a free speech zone and they're not putting up
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:19.340]  with it and it's going to blow up in their face yet again and then when the trump people are calm
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:23.260]  and nice and the anti-trump people act like a bunch of idiots it'll only blow up in their face
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:27.580]  that much better i think the best thing trump ever does is hang out in places like you know
[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:33.740]  new mexico and california where some of these crazy leftists are just to show what what morons
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:39.500]  they are well exactly and here's the other side of it a lot of people would tell me and i agree to
[02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:44.940]  a degree you know maybe we should tell everybody not to go so there is no bloodshed so there is no
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:51.420]  issue but on the flip side of that is uh you know again by i think you're right if we outnumber
[02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:56.380]  them five to one we've seen in the past where wherever they congregate black lives matter or
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:02.140]  other anti-trump or uh racist groups like that and when we outnumber them like but bikers for
[02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:07.500]  trump they typically back down and run with their tail tucked shared so there is that well that's
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:11.740]  right we have the numbers we have the truth on our side and we have the first amendment on our side
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:18.460]  and so this is just another arrogant attempt if we give into this pretty soon we'll be banned
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:22.300]  everywhere and and then it's over i mean that's what they want they want to come shut down the
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:26.300]  rallies they want to stop trump from speaking they want to keep people from coming it's not
[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:31.100]  worked so i say round of applause for the first amendment and the american people standing up
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:36.060]  and especially to all of the black americans hispanic americans and others that i've seen in many
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:41.820]  areas who are like 30 40 50 percent of the folks going in being yelled at and screamed at by the
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:49.180]  anti-trump people you know standing up to that type of bullying i say bravo if abuse has been i mean
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.860]  unprecedented just because of our choice of candidate and on top of that you know i find it
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:59.100]  very interesting and it's heartbreaking that an attack such as the one that just happened
[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:05.260]  and you know is what it takes to bring you know the issue forward but you know we've got a problem
[02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:10.620]  you know with you know a lot of different things and mr trump is right when it comes to vetting
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:16.700]  who's coming into this country so you know again attacks that happened just the other day
[02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:24.940]  are going to continue to happen if you know if we don't do something about it well tim other
[02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:29.740]  angles to this uh obviously if folks are on the east coast or in the midwest you know they're
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:33.260]  going to be pretty close to cleveland they need to be there obviously a lot of folks are worried
[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:37.980]  about housing and things even if you stay 20 miles away and you know drive in and and are
[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:42.060]  there just a few key events you don't have to be there the you know the whole three or four days
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:46.860]  it's important just to show up just to document not even to you know wear a trump shirt but to
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:53.100]  videotape and get this footage out so people can see exactly the type of ignorant folks
[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:58.380]  that are against the first amendment yes i mean you know again if we don't show up there in the
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:04.060]  document if we don't show up at least to give our free speed you know to stand up for our free speech
[02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:08.940]  then you know we do ourself a disservice i mean if we're patriotic warriors then we need to stand
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:13.580]  up for that because again you're you're right uh you know this could disappear on us pretty quick
[02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:17.660]  if we don't stand up for ourselves and this is one of the reasons i joined on with the aclu
[02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:21.740]  and i thought that was an interesting fact that they wanted to sue the city
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:26.940]  but uh you know again we have to do something about it if we don't if we just lay down and
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:32.620]  we let the you know the other agenda win so to speak the leftist black lives matter people
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:37.820]  and all the other groups that are trying to you know trend what america thinks so to speak
[02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:44.380]  then we've we've lost we've lost already timothy salady am i pronouncing that right sir yeah
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:52.060]  salady salady okay and that's citizens for trump dot com citizens for trump dot com um i want to

[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:14.380]  have a tim kennedy video we're at the end of the show yesterday the special forces soldier ufc
[02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:19.100]  fighter but the big thing is he's a patriot anti-new world order and has great influence in the
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:22.860]  military and elsewhere for folks that aren't aware of what's happening so that's why it's
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:26.780]  exciting to have him working with us as a correspondent uh on all these great reports
[02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:30.620]  you're about to start seeing in the next few weeks and we've already got five or six of them
[02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:36.860]  in the can he's shooting more uh this week and next week but when we come back i'm going to play
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:42.380]  this brief uh clip where he talks about this piece that they've put on the news uh where they're
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:47.580]  saying oh my gosh air 15s they kick so hard they hurt you they're so evil oh my gosh don't get one
[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:54.380]  i have ptsd from it this is part of the anti-gun brainwashing the opposite of what we do where
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:59.180]  we simply point out that you can go out and learn how to use a gun and that it's empowering
[02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:04.380]  and that if you're quote a feminist you should you know want women to be equalized when women do
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:11.260]  get attacked by men or if you're a man attacked by a stronger man or a bunch of men that that that
[02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:16.940]  the gun is a great equalizer that is the most liberal thing i can imagine we talk about liberal
[02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:22.380]  it means more freedom more defense more security more private property more choices more literature
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:28.780]  more culture more art the opposite of what modern orthodox islam is but they don't want us to defend
[02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:33.660]  ourselves and they're blaming the second amendment all over the news saying it's time to repeal the
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:39.660]  second amendment that's all over newspapers from rolling stone do you name it today
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:47.100]  it is mind-blowing ucla professor congress should secretly suspend second amendment has a whole plan
[02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:53.820]  for that technocrats just say start individually doing it put them on a no buy list no one will
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:59.500]  know we've banned it these folks mean business they mean business speaking of tim kennedy
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:05.260]  we are going to finance being able to have all these productions and and helicopters and drones
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:09.740]  and just amazing things we're going to do uh now with a shoestring budget we can do some big
[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:14.220]  things we're financing that selling products at info wars life calm the different circles

[02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:45.340]  things like wormwood in it why is it called organic wormwood for thousands of years in ancient
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:50.860]  english because it's what's known itself to flush out the worms and parasites that's one of 20
[02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:57.580]  something plus ingredients in there this sold out ladies and gentlemen for six months because it's
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:01.980]  so hard to get all these ingredients and have them be organic and have them be up to california
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:05.980]  standards which are basically meant to be almost impossible to pass so lawyers can sue everyone
[02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:12.700]  to make a bunch of money but regardless we with all of our products shoot for that and we have one
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:18.220]  or two products that came in where we just cannot do it at that level and so we're putting a note
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:22.700]  on there that it doesn't pass california standards and not selling it in california that's not this
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:28.140]  one that's ancient defense because it's got like 60 something things in it just everything there is
[02:29:28.140 --> 02:29:32.140]  and it's on one little level there's something about california standards so we won't sell it there
[02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:36.460]  but you know that's just an example of how hellish this is and why almost no companies have stuff
[02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:41.260]  to pass california standards but it's back in for a limited time i think it'll probably sell out
[02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:45.580]  this weekend even though i put it back to the regular price info warslife.com your purchase

[02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:35.100]  now with poll showing leave with a clear majority and remain supporters largely apathetic the shooting
[02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:40.380]  has quickly been politicized by the media and the ruling elite to create fear of british nationalism
[02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:45.740]  and to energize the supporters of globalism they report the mentally ill man shouted britain first
[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:51.660]  as he shot the uk got gun control decades ago and of course murder rates soared so it won't be used

[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:25.180]  so
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:33.660]  i have talked a lot about how back when i had time i would take
[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:43.420]  liberals as painful as it is out shooting and my father growing up i remember he would take
[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:47.580]  liberal friends of his that were newspaper editors and writers and people like that
[02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:54.380]  that out to our east texas ranch and they would be phobic of a shotgun and be all scared and act
[02:33:54.380 --> 02:34:00.220]  all neurotic and mentally ill they would be completely scared of bugs they would be completely
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:06.460]  scared of spiders these are domesticated people that usually lived lock and key uh daddy usually
[02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:10.940]  wasn't home they're usually nice intellectuals they're friendly people but they're emasculated
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:17.340]  and within about an hour of pulling out shotguns and rifles and you know shooting stuff
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:22.140]  they would be laughing saying this is not scary i don't know why i was ever so you know so afraid
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:25.420]  and my dad would say well you do need to know how to you know ever put your finger on the
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:28.540]  trigger so you're ready to pull the trigger and you know keep it you know aimed at the ground
[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:33.180]  and you know never you know go through the safety things with people and uh always unload the gun
[02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:39.420]  when you're going to transport it on and on and on just basic stuff and i've gone out with my judge
[02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:46.300]  and i've done this with the cast of silicon valley i've done it with other folks that when
[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:51.180]  he's doing a movie or a tv show or production he takes them to austin usually for south by southwest
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:54.380]  for their event takes them out to his ranch we even have some footage of that somewhere we never
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:35:01.020]  aired it and uh you you he takes leftist out he doesn't say i'm deprogramming you he just puts
[02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:04.940]  barbecue out and stuff and he has some former military folks out there that know what they're
[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:10.620]  doing and and we start getting women to shoot at you know m4s ar 15th and they go this is that
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:14.940]  evil gun on the news we just go go ahead and try it and within an hour or so the women are shooting
[02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:20.380]  bulls eye at 100 to 200 yards because women on average are better shots than men at the olympic
[02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:25.820]  level men a little bit more because they think men train harder but just as novices you take a woman
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:31.340]  versus a man same age in an hour of training women tend to be better shots it's just it's it's a known
[02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:36.780]  fact unless they're just shooting some guy that has an incredible kick and then they start going well
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:42.220]  i should be able to have a gun i should be able to have this i'm not bad absolutely wow so what
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:48.300]  types should i get for self defense and things like that and i'm allowed to have one of these i
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:51.500]  thought these are illegal because they have all these tv shows and movies where the cop pulls
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:56.380]  you over and it's based in new york chicago or dc and they go oh you got a handgun that's 20 years
[02:35:56.380 --> 02:36:02.140]  in prison because that will be some local state law they have it's unconstitutional so they don't
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:08.780]  even know that you're allowed to have guns i mean i remember just 15 20 years ago i had a carpet cleaner
[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:15.500]  yeah i was about 16 17 years ago carpet cleaner uh crew at my house and they went in my office and
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:23.340]  there was i didn't have kids then either and there was a gun rack that had a black winchester i think
[02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:31.340]  it was a defender like 300 pump shotgun there was a deer rifle under it but it was black it was black
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:43.980]  and he's like i can't clean in here uh and and the assistant was the one that wasn't mentally ill
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:47.900]  does that actually work for that steamer company a few years before
[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:51.500]  because it paid pretty good like 25 an hour so you have the assistant and then the main person
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:56.860]  but it was the main person stanley steamer carpet cleaner it was the main person that was freaking out
[02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:02.300]  going i don't know i it's a gun i don't know and he goes no that's it and so he goes out he goes
[02:37:02.300 --> 02:37:07.820]  outside and starts calling his bosses so i call them and they go yeah let me be the manager and he
[02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:13.340]  goes yeah i'm on the other line with them right now hold on such and such yes we understand yes
[02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:17.900]  we understand no he was going to call the police but now he isn't but we're just going to tell him
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:28.700]  to go so they left my house because in texas in a little three-bedroom blue collar house
[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:35.180]  or upper blue collar lower middle class that's actually four bedroom had a better
[02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:39.740]  process point is i tell these stories i go back to the actual memories and start imaging and you
[02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:44.380]  know having a memory scan of exactly what went on that's why i kind of bumble on stories sometimes
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:49.100]  because it's really what happened and but it's a stalt of it because there's so much info
[02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:55.740]  and i walked out there and i was like is there loading up the thing i said man i used to work
[02:37:55.740 --> 02:38:00.220]  here like four or five years ago we go and houses all the time with guns and all sorts of stuff
[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:08.220]  don't you go and houses with guns and there was the hispanic assistant and he's like man he's crazy
[02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:12.700]  i don't know it's weird yeah no i've only been working here a few weeks since weird
[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:20.380]  and then i went and told that story on access television the next night when i had my show and
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:26.540]  the assistant called in and told the rest of the story how they had actually called the police
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:32.060]  but the police had told him that a shotgun wasn't illegal and didn't come and that when he said this
[02:38:32.060 --> 02:38:39.100]  is wrong they fired him not the guy that wouldn't clean my house with one of the bedrooms turned
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:44.700]  into an office where i broadcast out of not because of that
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:54.140]  no they fired the quote assistant because he sat there and said this is crazy
[02:38:55.980 --> 02:39:02.700]  so that's what we're dealing with in this country and they are programming people they are controlling
[02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:10.140]  people they are absolutely creating undue phobias and and psychological almost agoraphobic
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:16.620]  concern overseeing a fellow slave with a gun and the essence of what i'm doing and what tim
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:21.980]  kennedy's are doing and others are doing whether it's gardening or whether it's learning how to
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:26.060]  camp or whether it's learning how to swim a lot of folks that want to swim or whether it's learning
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:31.820]  how to box or grapple or learning how to clean a gun or learning how to work on your car becoming
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:37.340]  somewhat self-sufficient and we're not up here on some high horse claiming we have all the answers
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:43.820]  though tim kennedy is pretty much superman across the board we're just trying to make americana and
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:51.420]  being human and being inventive and being adaptive and being involved fun again and not just watching
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:55.980]  tv and being a zombie that's why people are so unfulfilled every study shows people that are
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:40:02.860]  working hard involved doing lots of hobbies in their communities politically active live longer
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:09.580]  are happier develop new mental connections and neurons in the brain humanity is turning into
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:15.260]  a bunch of jellyfish and it's now time to realize we're going to fix the country and fix the world
[02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:20.700]  fixing ourselves one person at a time and again i'm not up here on some high horse i'm slowly
[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:26.540]  becoming healthy again slowly becoming uh you know more inventive and more involved and
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:30.620]  getting back into guns because i'm so busy i don't have a lot of time to go out and shoot guns or
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:35.180]  you know be proficient in that like i used to be when i was 18 i could shoot to the same hole with
[02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:43.500]  the remington 700 308 over and over again with a 300 scope not even that fancy at 200 yards and
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:48.540]  i'll be out at these quasi police ranges where the cops are out shooting and i was out shooting
[02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:54.300]  the swat teams you name it i was in some of the police uh contest deals where you could have
[02:40:55.020 --> 02:41:02.220]  quote civilians involved but 40 percent 60 percent depending on the the event were police
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:07.740]  sometimes 80 percent and they would get so upset when i'd go out there and go through those ranges
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:13.420]  with a pistol and things like that or handgun uh and you know be in the top 10 percentile
[02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:20.780]  out of 100 people competing well that's not that good uh but nowadays i am horrible i mean 200 yards
[02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:27.260]  i got a pattern that's like depending on the windage and things like that you know maybe two
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:32.940]  inches i mean that is just terrible i go out and try to shoot some dub or quail miss half the time i
[02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:41.180]  go out to the clay uh shooting events and you know i might i might miss one out of five clay
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:47.980]  pigeons i was 18 i'd i would go an hour without missing one was just sickening so the point is
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:52.620]  is that i'm going to get back into all that myself as well without further ado though let's go to
[02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:57.340]  this piece where tim and i were talking about this yesterday but we did them the video so i thought
[02:41:57.340 --> 02:42:04.220]  i'd actually interspersed the video with little girl shooting 223s you know shooting in m4s or
[02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:09.660]  556 depending on you know whether you're talking about nato or civilian without getting into all
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:17.260]  the little numbers games here's the video first of some little girls shooting um the evil bush master
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:23.660]  the evil ar-15 the evil m4 uh that people claim is so dangerous and kicks so hard because the
[02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:28.300]  truth is they know it doesn't kick and it's perfect for women it's perfect for everybody so they can
[02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:33.900]  demonize that front line number one weapon then they can demonize them all and bring them all down
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:39.420]  bring down all semi-autos and then later get your bolt actions and single shots as well uh and then
[02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:44.860]  we play this new york daily news reporter acting about how freaked out he is after he went into a
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:50.140]  gun range and shot a gun but they don't even really show that because who knows if they even did it
[02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:59.580]  here it is nice shot abby right right to the right of the bull's eye good shot baby you're hot
[02:43:03.100 --> 02:43:08.700]  finger off the trigger how did that feel pretty good excellent okay let's see it again good trigger
[02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:15.660]  discipline trigger off you're a radio listener it looks like a four-year-old clip they're having
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:19.500]  to find it so i'll play it later and put it together with you talking about it on the nightly news
[02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:24.700]  but describe this clip it's it's it is the embodiments the personification of the
[02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:33.340]  neutering of what it means to be a man so this guy goes and shoots an m4 at the range
[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:42.540]  and um he has this catastrophic nearly traumatic event while he's trying to shoot an m4 it's 223
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:45.180]  this is what i let like my 10-year-old shoot
[02:43:56.620 --> 02:44:01.180]  video of a five-year-old six-year-old shooting it's just a little bit bigger than a 22 there's no
[02:44:01.180 --> 02:44:05.580]  kick no no kick at all none of you push it in your shoulder nothing nothing so he shoots this gun a
[02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:10.620]  couple of times and he's like the concussion the gases the smell of it all it was so overwhelming
[02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:15.340]  i was i was i had post-traumatic stress for hours after it he's trying to create a phobia
[02:44:16.140 --> 02:44:20.220]  so people don't do it i mean i'm not the super soldier but i sit there and fire
[02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:26.780]  a hundred rounds with a 50 cal handheld effortlessly and then these guys are like can't shoot a 223
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:30.460]  but i don't know if they've been like actually emasculated or if they're just trying to demonstrate
[02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:37.260]  to the world how weak americans are i mean it seems like it's intentional he's like no no no no
[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:42.380]  it's not cool to go and work hard and to go train and go shoot it's better just to be like
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:47.100]  the biggest sissy on the planet that can't even shoot it a 223 because it hurts my shoulder
[02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:51.980]  and the gases and seeing the brass fly out it's just it's traumatizing well that's like these
[02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:55.900]  sorts of business warriors that see the chalk on the ground and start freaking out and convulsing
[02:44:55.900 --> 02:45:01.740]  but not everybody's like that how do you what should the country do about gun owners or gun
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:09.100]  buyers who shouldn't have the guns tough question the sheer firepower of those kind of weapons is
[02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:15.020]  absolutely awesome uh my ears are still ringing and we had serious sound protection uh it's a
[02:45:15.020 --> 02:45:19.980]  very dangerous weapon in the wrong hands as frank said uh and keeping it out of the wrong hands is
[02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:26.380]  the challenge i mean we have these incredibly domesticated morons the new york daily news just
[02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:30.540]  nitting around and then it doesn't show him even shoot on the video
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:37.340]  it's just crazy yeah what about guns in the wrong hands of a tyrannical government
[02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:44.220]  what about that by the way as i mentioned earlier we are running a special 15 off the
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:53.260]  tim kennedy special on info wars life products like brain force supermail vitality and of
[02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:58.220]  course secret 12 methylcobalamin vitamin b12 and folks you can look at the studies on bottom of b12
[02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:04.460]  most people absorb almost none of it in their gut if you do it's three four five percent of
[02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:09.580]  your lucky under the tongue you can get a lot more still not as good as injectable but what this is
[02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:15.660]  is the injectable you know level quality methylcobalamin that you put under your tongue with a
[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:21.180]  dripper and then you absorb a lot more than you would uh just taking it in to your stomach now
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:27.180]  again consult your physician before you take vitamin b12 organic under your tongue because
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:31.100]  it's so dangerous and before you go outside or breathe air i'm just gonna it does say that on
[02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:36.460]  the bottle uh but uh this is this is the same stuff that you get from a doctor that cost you
[02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:40.940]  50 bucks because i've done it that you inject into your you know fat and it gives you a lot of
[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:45.180]  energy and it's totally healthy i've gone out and done it just to test and see and quite frankly
[02:46:45.180 --> 02:46:50.780]  the injectable of methylcobalamin has a better effect than this under the tongue taking pills i
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:56.780]  don't even feel it doesn't even do anything in injecting it whoa you got to get a prescription
[02:46:56.780 --> 02:47:01.500]  for that and i hate needles but i i do inject vitamin b12 a few days a week when i have the
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:05.900]  prescription but it's the methylcobalamin the same stuff it's like this is sweet this is
[02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:12.300]  that sugar in it no that's how vitamin b12 taste most of the stuff they have at the store is synthetic
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:17.100]  it doesn't even get absorbed period it's totally fake but the government lets them sell it this
[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:26.540]  is true organic vegan derived methylcobalamin with another type of v12 that makes it absorb 20%
[02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:30.700]  is the forget how you pronounce it a cedophilcobalamin or whatever the scientists have all explained
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:35.020]  it to me all i know is i got a major i don't give this to the kids in the afternoon or at night
[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:40.220]  you know kids you're in the winter or whatever or i want to be healthy every day secret 12 secret
[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:46.460]  12 in the morning in the morning and it doesn't have caffeine or stimulants the way my dad describes
[02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:52.700]  it is that it's and he's a chemist and retired doctor is and he used to develop drugs for
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:57.820]  pharmaceutical companies is that it's the precursor basically of everything vitamin b12
[02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:02.700]  they think is like the precursor of everything else you've got to have it to develop your
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:07.580]  hormones to build just everything then there's some other things that are precursors to like water
[02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:14.700]  oxygen iodine iodine's the good halogen all the others are bad your body will use the bad ones
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:20.620]  the chlorine the fluoride the bromine all the rest of it unless you have the good halogen and that is
[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:28.540]  of course secret 12 that is of course the good halogen x2 nascent iodine you've got to have
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:32.460]  these in your body you've absolutely got to have them and just like we got to have freedom
[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:37.340]  and when you buy them at infowarslife.com you get the very best products that the absolute
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:44.700]  nutraceutical supplement freaks come up with i mean the soup nazis love us use the Seinfeld
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:47.980]  joke i don't mean literal nazis folks i mean you know the guy that makes the very best soup
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:52.300]  is totally neurotic about it he's called a soup nazi and now you call somebody that you know is
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:56.540]  makes the very best italian food you know this place is like a you know or nazis about it being
[02:48:56.540 --> 02:49:01.340]  the best or whatever that means totally obsessed neurotic about the very best highest cleanest
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:07.500]  quality it's not a good connotation though for nazis but you know what i mean the neurotic third
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:13.500]  party nutraceutical uh review sites just love us they're like why is this right wing lunatic
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:19.340]  having the best stuff because we're not right wing lunatics we just want we're against the
[02:49:19.340 --> 02:49:23.900]  geoengineering we're against the the leaking nuclear reactors we're against the glyphosates
[02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:28.140]  we're against the gmo we've done the research we know there's a lot of research that quote leftists
[02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:32.700]  have done that's real stuff that's why we are confused that you're anti-gun when the statistics
[02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:37.500]  show you should be pro-gun or why you like hillary when she's a fascist warmonger or
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:42.860]  but again those are pop liberals on the ground that are the super dumb social justice warriors
[02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:49.500]  i know there's real liberals a la you know the 60s or 70s that had some good points and were
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:54.780]  against the wars and against discrimination and really were against racism but all of that's
[02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:59.340]  been hijacked and and madison avenue and wall street have taken control of it and turned
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:02.540]  into political weapons to get us all of each other's throats that's what i'm getting at
[02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:06.220]  i'm not plugging here i'm just i'm just going off into the generalities of
[02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:11.500]  it isn't about liberal or conservative but people communicate with those terms
[02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:17.980]  so yes the modern liberal is a very anti-liberal anti-free speech anti-american weirdo group
[02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:21.500]  who i see is very threatening and bizarre and who don't even care about their own interests
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:30.860]  they're allied with orthodox which we call radical islam and so all i'm saying is i don't go to an
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:34.940]  art opening so i feel like i'm an intellectual to sit around listen to myself talk to other
[02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:39.100]  trendies i go to an art opening if i like who the artist is because i want to buy some of the art
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:46.460]  see i don't i don't like culture and theater and things like that because i'm trying to act like
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:52.940]  i'm cultured i'm a barbarian goblin but i also love culture and art because i've got those areas
[02:50:52.940 --> 02:51:00.940]  in my life i'm multifaceted i'm not a stereotype and neither should you be here's dr paul mayer

[02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:16.780]  oh
[02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:28.780]  i am midwest farmer i make a living off the land i ride a john deere tractor i'm a liberated man
[02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:35.180]  man the rain it has unfolded see willy nelson loved me boy when i used to bash bush
[02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:47.740]  and he's he's he had disliked me now he tells me that he's coming but that's an example of how
[02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:52.540]  perspectives work i was against bush because of warrantless surveillance and invading the wrong
[02:54:52.540 --> 02:55:02.060]  country and covering up 911 and being for the assault weapons ban and i criticized him for
[02:55:02.060 --> 02:55:10.220]  all that and liberals whether it was martin sheen or whether it was willy nelson
[02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:15.180]  they didn't care as long as i was bashing bush
[02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:22.140]  and i'd sit there and i'd have dinner with them and i'd say i'm not a liberal and they go well i
[02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:26.300]  know i'm not either i like organic milk i think vaccines are bad and gmo's bad and
[02:55:27.020 --> 02:55:31.660]  we go out go shooting out there but then as soon as obama comes in it's like why are you being so
[02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:36.460]  mean to obama i'm like well meet the new boss same as the old boss you know but because he's
[02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:41.020]  quote a liberal and because he's quote black he gets all his political cover we're in deep
[02:55:41.020 --> 02:55:45.020]  trouble and now finally even the head of the green party's come out and said that wow obama
[02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:49.980]  was worse than bush and so is jonathan turley and everybody else because it's beyond that these are
[02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:56.460]  just front people to get their agenda through and so if donald trump gets in and starts doing a
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:02.140]  bunch of bad stuff and and doesn't look if he isn't just out to get the country and turns the economy
[02:56:02.140 --> 02:56:06.140]  on and doesn't screw people over if he doesn't get a whole bunch of stuff done other than that i'll
[02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:11.660]  be happy i don't even expect purity or something to be perfect i just don't want foaming at the
[02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:15.980]  mouth globalist that are completely out to get us on every front that's what i'm getting it
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:22.940]  now before i go any further here this is a big deal and i'm going to shoot a special report
[02:56:22.940 --> 02:56:29.020]  about this for the nightly news tonight i'm also going to shoot one for the show tomorrow
[02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:33.100]  because i didn't get to this enough but i'm going to i want to tailor this because this
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:38.940]  needs a lot of added research and data hacker release of secret clinton docks from the state
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:43.820]  department dnc trump opposition file donor list this is very interesting to see who's doing what and
[02:56:43.820 --> 02:56:50.620]  and very very powerful info uh we're also going to be getting into uh more of the wonders of islam
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:55.900]  as the taliban uses honey trap boys to kill afki and police when i talk about homosexuality being
[02:56:55.900 --> 02:57:02.460]  the highest in islam and pedophilia for that matter uh i see comments going jones is crazy
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:09.980]  they kill gays no i'm not the one that's crazy they are they're the ones i had the former head
[02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:13.580]  of the state department psych warfare around they got the camp david accords on saying this yesterday
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:17.580]  okay i already knew this everybody knows this that's researched it but the public is so ignorant
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:24.060]  they think i'm just talking martian here that's what i'm saying homosexuality is off the charts
[02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:32.540]  in islam look it up pedophilia is basically legal but then if the imams or others in the
[02:57:32.540 --> 02:57:37.740]  islamic group want to say that you are involved in homosexuality from a biblical perspective then
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:44.780]  they can kill you it's have your cake eat it too okay and that's what's going on and it's a freak
[02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:49.980]  show and as i said a thousand times i'm not sitting here taking the blame for these mass

[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:15.180]  kill you that's in our instincts too we're afraid of that's why you can have like a cat in your house

[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:38.700]  here with my own instincts that we're being overrun with tyranny we're seeing all sorts of evil be
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:43.260]  set up and i am here ringing the alarm saying you ought to be scared of tyranny democide in the last
[03:01:43.260 --> 03:01:50.860]  hundred years killed over 200 million people that's death by government that's non-military deaths
[03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:58.940]  200 what is it 262 million that number's like a decade old university of hawaii on the lulu
[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:08.140]  man but i tell you i'm also going to have a message to donald trump today donald trump to talk
[03:02:08.140 --> 03:02:13.660]  with in our area about denying second amendment to people on terror watch list and you read his
[03:02:13.660 --> 03:02:17.340]  tweet i don't know exactly what to make of it because he sounds like he's going to talk to him
[03:02:17.340 --> 03:02:22.300]  about doing that and that just denies due process is very very dangerous so this will be the first
[03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:27.340]  time i've got a real issue with donald trump other than him not understanding or not getting or not
[03:02:28.460 --> 03:02:32.860]  fully comprehending or maybe being wrong on the whole apple thing hey give the fbi the code they've
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:37.740]  got a warrant yeah i get it give them the code they've got a warrant to the san Bernadino shooter
[03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:43.100]  that makes sense doesn't it except there isn't one code it's the keys to everybody's iphone
[03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:47.740]  and they could get through it they don't need to say they're getting through that encryption you
[03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:51.740]  get through it with the wire that goes in and you can get into that in a few minutes with with any
[03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:57.340]  good hacker you know the plug in to give it power that's an electronic interface with the phone
[03:02:57.340 --> 03:03:01.340]  and you've got all the apps most of them have trojan horses built in you just call the company's
[03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:05.180]  administrators they'll give it to you and the fbi has all that it was all red herring it was all bull
[03:03:05.180 --> 03:03:10.460]  bull but do i throw donald trump out because of that no he's killing political correctness he's
[03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:16.060]  going up against globalism he's exposing that our government's been funding isis he's exposing
[03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:20.540]  the crooked corruption of democratic republican parties he has not been taking political money
[03:03:20.540 --> 03:03:24.940]  up until now now he's in the general election he's pretty much has to like saying well oxygen
[03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:30.380]  is corrupt well you when you're in space you need it well he's gonna get the oxygen from corrupt
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:35.980]  people well they're the ones that got the money again still trust but verify we got to stay very
[03:03:35.980 --> 03:03:40.460]  close to the situation and watch it but i'm going to be going over all of that today and i'm also
[03:03:40.460 --> 03:03:43.900]  going to follow report on this because i didn't get to this properly you know rob do really should
[03:03:43.900 --> 03:03:51.820]  because this is a big deal it's up on info wars dot com on tuesday june 14th nato announced that if
[03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:56.460]  a nato member country becomes the victim of cyber attack by persons in the non nato countries such
[03:03:56.460 --> 03:04:02.380]  as russia china the nato's article five collective defense provision requires each nato member
[03:04:02.380 --> 03:04:09.900]  country to join that nato member country if it decides to strike back against the attacking
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:18.620]  country the paramilitary decision for this was made two years ago after kramia abandoned
[03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:23.900]  ukraine and rejoined russia of which has been part of unilaterally involved transformation
[03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:30.620]  to ukraine by the soviet dictator nikita khrushchev in 1954 the nato decision was made in anticipation
[03:04:30.620 --> 03:04:35.420]  of ukraine's ultimately becoming a nato member country which still hasn't happened however only
[03:04:35.420 --> 03:04:42.700]  now is nato declaring cyber war itself to be included as a real war under the nato treaty
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:46.940]  collective defense provision and they go on to say that they militarily strike countries that are
[03:04:46.940 --> 03:04:54.300]  involved in that folks can you imagine a you can't prove who did it it's perfect for frame ups
[03:04:54.940 --> 03:05:00.220]  and then b it starts a wider war when you do it it's just crazy a british member of parliament
[03:05:00.220 --> 03:05:05.180]  has just been shot with a handgun and stabbed to death with a knife the keller got a job six
[03:05:05.180 --> 03:05:10.060]  years ago working in a park after being referred by mental health clinic he said working in the park
[03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:16.060]  was quote better than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world this happens exactly one
[03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:20.300]  week before the brexit vote the referendum on whether britain will leave the european union
[03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:25.500]  a fear campaign by prime minister cameron and others has tried without success to scare people
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:30.700]  about economic recrimination by the bankers and the european elite if they leave now with poll
[03:05:30.700 --> 03:05:35.180]  showing lee with a clear majority and remain supporters largely apathetic the shooting has
[03:05:35.180 --> 03:05:40.220]  quickly been politicized by the media and the ruling elite to create fear of british nationalism
[03:05:40.220 --> 03:05:45.660]  and to energize the supporters of globalism they report the mentally ill man shouted britain first
[03:05:45.660 --> 03:05:51.500]  as he shot the uk got gun control decades ago and of course murder rates soared so it won't be used
[03:05:51.500 --> 03:05:56.620]  to push for gun control but it will be used to try to energize the supporters of globalism

[03:08:35.900 --> 03:08:40.700]  at your radio station or uh television station even call them up tell them hey carry that fourth
[03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:46.620]  hour because we always go over more news more phone calls we're trying to make the fourth
[03:08:46.620 --> 03:08:52.540]  hour great again i've got a lot of gun news we even got some exclusive uh news from adan
[03:08:52.540 --> 03:08:57.580]  salazar out of houston as a result of this uh gay nightclub shooting we're going to get into a
[03:08:57.580 --> 03:09:02.940]  little bit about a professor who uh traveled the world and says socialism doesn't work and usually
[03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:10.140]  you see professors preaching socialism and also calls it looks like uh there's a craigslist ad
[03:09:10.140 --> 03:09:15.740]  for a threat of an orlando style massacre in san diego but first i want to get to and i'm gonna
[03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:19.740]  have david night come in at the bottom of the hour we're going to talk about the concept of what
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:23.660]  would jesus do at the gay bar shooting because there's lots of calls from both sides of the
[03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:29.580]  religious spectrum islam and even the hard um i guess evangelical right i'm not even sure if
[03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:34.380]  that's the correct term for it but how they've come out and kind of attacked or uh i guess
[03:09:34.380 --> 03:09:39.020]  celebrated what has gone on we're going to talk about why that's not needed and why reaching out
[03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:43.100]  to people with an open hand is always going to yield you better results than uh trying to
[03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:49.020]  be abrasive and dis and uh and uh confrontational but here we go here's the first tweet i want to
[03:09:49.020 --> 03:09:54.460]  read from stefa malin you if you are for gun control then you are not against guns because the
[03:09:54.460 --> 03:09:59.900]  guns will be needed to disarm people so it's not that you're anti-gun you'll need the police's guns
[03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:05.020]  to take away other people's guns so you're very pro-gun you just believe that only the government
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:09.740]  which is of course so reliable and honest moral and virtuous should be allowed to have guns so
[03:10:09.740 --> 03:10:14.300]  there is no such thing as gun control there is only centralizing gun ownership in the hands
[03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:20.140]  of a small political elite and their minions right on the dot right there right on the dot
[03:10:20.140 --> 03:10:26.540]  he's got it he understands where this argument comes from and while the left can't understand that
[03:10:27.340 --> 03:10:32.300]  there's always going to be one side with guns and even when the government which has been caught
[03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:37.980]  shipping guns to mexico uh they're gonna still criminals are always going to be getting guns
[03:10:37.980 --> 03:10:43.420]  look at chicago most gun control laws highest gun murder rate and here's the next one i i
[03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:49.580]  tweeted out this is from uh heavy metal patriot legal gun owners have over 200 million guns in
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:55.500]  12 trillion rounds of ammo i misspoke yesterday when i brought that up talking to alex as we went
[03:10:55.500 --> 03:11:00.540]  into the fourth hour seriously people if we were a problem you would know it that's right because
[03:11:00.540 --> 03:11:04.940]  honest real gun owners aren't going to go out and shoot people they're going to protect themselves
[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:08.940]  they're going to teach their kids how to shoot they're going to go hunting but mainly it's there
[03:11:08.940 --> 03:11:15.020]  for self-defense and against the tyrannical government which is why we have it's not perfect
[03:11:15.020 --> 03:11:20.300]  people but it's the best system in the world and that's why you have people uh building rafts out
[03:11:20.300 --> 03:11:24.220]  of garbage to get here and they're doing the same thing get into europe because where they're coming
[03:11:24.220 --> 03:11:30.620]  from is even worse so let's go to this article this is uh adan salazar and this is exclusive
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:38.140]  info wars gun range selling out free concealed handgun courses for lgbt company has opened
[03:11:38.140 --> 03:11:42.540]  several classes since announcing the offer and this is uh the owners of the shallow gun range on
[03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:48.620]  the outskirts of houston we've got our reporters going there tomorrow after they hit this dallas
[03:11:48.620 --> 03:11:52.540]  trump rally to go interview the owners of the shallow gun range so we're going to make that
[03:11:52.540 --> 03:11:57.580]  we're going to make that happen and uh due to the overwhelming demand the uh at shallow shooting
[03:11:57.580 --> 03:12:01.900]  we'll be offering additional classes please call us they said in a recent facebook post as we can't
[03:12:01.900 --> 03:12:06.620]  access our voicemail due to the volume of calls and our email server has crashed due to the number
[03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:12.860]  of emails we've been inundated with phone calls ever since the news went out and uh shallow manager
[03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:18.380]  jeff stanford stanford says this offer not stems from a marketing standpoint but from the desire
[03:12:18.380 --> 03:12:23.740]  to rally more people behind the second amendment okay i'm going to read that one more time to rally
[03:12:23.740 --> 03:12:27.500]  more people behind the second amendment if you care about the second amendment you should be
[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:31.500]  celebrating this and should be telling other people in your area about it this is an effort to
[03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:36.780]  reach out to a very small but vocal and passionate community that can be positive advocates for the
[03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:41.740]  of the second amendment for us and if people don't agree with that then they're absolutely wrong
[03:12:41.740 --> 03:12:46.780]  and they're not an advocate that they think they are so he's saying reach out with an open hand
[03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:52.060]  instead of a closed fist and that's what we have to do because what they're doing now it's all a
[03:12:52.060 --> 03:12:56.700]  part of divide and conquer it's to get americans fighting with each other and the reason we have
[03:12:56.700 --> 03:13:01.180]  this country is so people of all walks of life can come together and build a society we may not
[03:13:01.180 --> 03:13:05.820]  agree with everything that each other does and that is our right to not agree with it and it's
[03:13:05.820 --> 03:13:11.420]  also our right to speak out against it but it's not our right to go out and physically harm people
[03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:15.740]  our call for the harming of others in that so i'm going to have david night talking about that later
[03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:21.980]  on but that was exclusive to info wars and that's an adan salazar article meanwhile we have this
[03:13:21.980 --> 03:13:28.860]  craigslist ad oh before we get to that let me give out the call in number 800 259 9231 800
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:34.140]  259 9231 i'll be taking your calls especially when david's on to talk about this issue because
[03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:39.340]  i think it's a really important issue that we're not we're not addressing a lot and i like the way
[03:13:39.340 --> 03:13:45.980]  this gun owner is handling it by offering free gun classes to people so maybe the next time a
[03:13:45.980 --> 03:13:51.820]  shooter goes to a bar and starts shooting it up or any place where people are he will be responded
[03:13:51.820 --> 03:13:57.340]  back in force by other people notice it didn't happen in texas and notice the last time it did
[03:13:57.340 --> 03:14:03.020]  happen in texas the guys were taken out before they could get too far from their car that's because
[03:14:03.020 --> 03:14:07.420]  people in texas are armed and you may not know it you walk around the office here there's a lot of
[03:14:07.420 --> 03:14:15.580]  people armed and we are not afraid so an armed population is a safe and a very polite population
[03:14:15.580 --> 03:14:21.500]  as well so here we go craigslist ad threatens or lendo style massacre in san diego police are
[03:14:21.500 --> 03:14:27.260]  investigating the online threat of violence to san diego's lgbt community that reads your next
[03:14:27.260 --> 03:14:33.660]  on tuesday evening a abc 10 news viewers saw the post in the men seeking men's section of the craigslist
[03:14:33.660 --> 03:14:38.060]  san diego personal ads he took a screenshot and sent it before the post was flagged and removed
[03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:43.500]  the post was titled we need more orlandos and it's accompanied by a photo of a hand firing a
[03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:47.260]  revolver with a bullet coming out of the barrel the post reads orlendo was long overdue cleanse
[03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:51.260]  your community of felt that gives decent gay men and women a bad name these people are walking
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:58.860]  disease bug chasers and thank god for aids and 9 11 and now orlendo san diego you're next
[03:14:58.860 --> 03:15:05.900]  and guess what a lot of gun control in san diego in california it's hard to get guns there
[03:15:05.900 --> 03:15:10.380]  it's hard to keep them and you can't get them very fast so of course that's where you're
[03:15:10.380 --> 03:15:15.660]  going to see those types of attacks you're going to see them in schools and bars places where guns
[03:15:15.660 --> 03:15:22.540]  are not allowed meanwhile we have our reporters heading up to dalis today dalis police practice
[03:15:22.540 --> 03:15:27.820]  riot control ahead of donald trump visit dalis police stage demonstration and riot drills
[03:15:27.820 --> 03:15:32.620]  at wednesday at fair park the day before large demonstrations are planned against presumptive
[03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:38.300]  republican presidential nominee donald trump about 600 dalis police officers participated
[03:15:38.300 --> 03:15:42.940]  in the training with riot helmets and shields there was smoke to simulate tear gas and scores of
[03:15:42.940 --> 03:15:48.060]  police recruits playing the role of unruly demonstrators hopefully they weren't acting
[03:15:48.060 --> 03:15:51.660]  and saying stuff like oh we're sovereign citizens you can't do that to us which we've seen in the
[03:15:51.660 --> 03:15:57.900]  past with our military because that's who our military is practicing to go after our at least
[03:15:57.900 --> 03:16:02.300]  homeland security controlled military to go after people who say they're sovereign citizens
[03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:07.180]  not against people who say you know they're islamist radicals because you can't say that in the
[03:16:07.180 --> 03:16:13.820]  military and here is this article former cia head not the one i chased through the streets of
[03:16:13.820 --> 03:16:19.660]  dresden but uh it was general retired general michael hayden made the point that the national
[03:16:19.660 --> 03:16:24.780]  security strategy is being hindered because there's now a hesitance to pursue some cases
[03:16:24.780 --> 03:16:29.580]  for fear of being branded a bigot is it possible that people are being politically correct he
[03:16:29.580 --> 03:16:34.460]  asked jake tapper and it's interesting uh jake tapper put out a series of tweets where he is
[03:16:34.460 --> 03:16:41.340]  actually questioning radical islam in its role he's not fully pulling the line of cnn not blaming
[03:16:41.340 --> 03:16:45.740]  islam at all and just saying well it's gun's problem he's actually taking the role of looking
[03:16:45.740 --> 03:16:51.100]  at who's actually shooting the gun instead of blaming the gun itself as an inanimate object
[03:16:51.820 --> 03:16:58.780]  once again our calling numbers 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 if you want to get in on this
[03:16:58.780 --> 03:17:04.220]  conversation and talk about uh gun gun rights in this country i think they're too restrictive
[03:17:04.220 --> 03:17:08.540]  already more people are coming out of the woodwork saying we have to restrict them we saw the piece
[03:17:08.540 --> 03:17:15.580]  earlier with the uh new york post writer that alex played where he was afraid he had ptsd
[03:17:15.580 --> 03:17:19.580]  you know notice he didn't say that on video but he put it in writing later he was trying to figure
[03:17:19.580 --> 03:17:27.260]  out how he could couch his fear into a more uh a more vivid approach of how to explain how guns
[03:17:27.260 --> 03:17:32.540]  are scary and we of course we counter that showing kids shooting ar-15s having no problem
[03:17:32.540 --> 03:17:37.180]  and actually liking it the one kid said how did he goes how'd you feel he goes pretty good
[03:17:37.180 --> 03:17:42.140]  and he went back and shot a few more rounds off we showed little girls shooting the ar-15 of course
[03:17:42.140 --> 03:17:46.220]  you had joe biden coming out a few years ago saying buy a shotgun and we countered that with
[03:17:46.220 --> 03:17:51.500]  uh videos of women shooting shotguns and falling on their rears because a 12 gauge shotgun does
[03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:56.860]  give a big kick but an ar-15 is a really great gun to shoot and it's very easy to shoot i've
[03:17:56.860 --> 03:18:02.860]  shot many of them and they are hunting rifles for those of you out there on uh facebook who say
[03:18:02.860 --> 03:18:07.740]  oh no we don't we don't need their nose those aren't hunting rifles yeah they are go hog hunting
[03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:13.420]  with them you'll be happy you had one so back to the general he says you look at the fort hood case
[03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:18.140]  when the army knew nadal hasan had become an extremist and he'd been talking to anwar al-akhi
[03:18:18.140 --> 03:18:22.620]  incidentally anwar al-akhi went to a dinner at the pentagon right after 9 11 so he's probably
[03:18:22.620 --> 03:18:28.140]  got some cia ties there is there any hesitant uh hesitance to be branded a bigot and then he also
[03:18:28.140 --> 03:18:33.580]  brings up furuk abdul matala who is the failed underwear bomber interestingly enough he was
[03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:38.380]  given a bomb that could not work and i had an argument with the tsa officer when when i was
[03:18:38.380 --> 03:18:44.140]  going to um dresden germany as we were getting felt up in the austin airport he was saying well
[03:18:44.140 --> 03:18:47.500]  we need these body scanners because the underwear bomber i go you know he's given a bomb that couldn't
[03:18:47.500 --> 03:18:51.900]  work do you know the fbi knew who he was do you know his father had contacted him did you know
[03:18:51.900 --> 03:18:56.140]  that the uh undersecretary of state patrick kennedy came out on video later and said
[03:18:56.700 --> 03:19:02.300]  we knew who this guy was and we wanted to follow him we were letting him go through his mission
[03:19:02.300 --> 03:19:07.900]  and uh because we want to see who he was working with and then you had lawyer curt haskell come
[03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:14.220]  out and come on our show in the beginning and say hey this guy was put on this plane by a well-dressed
[03:19:14.220 --> 03:19:20.860]  man who spoke perfect english uh was an indian but spoke in an english accent and brought the guy up
[03:19:20.860 --> 03:19:25.660]  and said hey he doesn't have a passport but we do this all the time how does that happen okay but
[03:19:25.660 --> 03:19:30.460]  they use these events and you see he's using this event again but for a different uh standpoint
[03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:36.380]  but they use that event when it first came out to say we've got to go after uh people getting on
[03:19:36.380 --> 03:19:39.820]  planes and we have to have these underwear bombs because or have to have these body scanners because
[03:19:39.820 --> 03:19:45.340]  only they could pick up this bomb which of course is a lie because we've seen how you could fail it
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:50.300]  with a sewing kit from a dollar store we've proven it all the government's lying over and over again
[03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:54.140]  we'll be back with more and your calls coming up it's the fourth hour of overdrive i'm your

[03:24:22.940 --> 03:24:27.820]  well this is very precarious as you join us back into the fourth hour i'm your host rob do just
[03:24:27.820 --> 03:24:34.300]  saw this on twitter school brands third grader with i need lunch money stamp so i guess he came
[03:24:34.300 --> 03:24:38.300]  he went to school without the lunch money and instead of sending the child home with a piece
[03:24:38.300 --> 03:24:45.100]  of paper they stamp the child talk about uh is this a formal bullying and shaming the kids
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:51.820]  somebody has this happen in uh alabama i believe yeah garden dale alabama and this is all part of
[03:24:51.820 --> 03:24:56.540]  the uh i guess the precarious class the class that is like just one they have jobs they're employed
[03:24:56.540 --> 03:25:02.140]  but they're one step away from uh losing it all and then losing it as gerald salante says and that
[03:25:02.140 --> 03:25:07.260]  was one of the topics of bill deberg was what to do with the precarious class and we did an interview
[03:25:07.820 --> 03:25:13.100]  in fact i don't even know if i put that interview out it was with the info krig dot com and i need
[03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:19.180]  to actually put that uh interview out because he broke down why they're talking about the precarious
[03:25:19.180 --> 03:25:23.340]  class not because they care about the poor people but because they want to set up a system where
[03:25:23.340 --> 03:25:27.340]  they're getting these monthly stipends and in order to get these monthly stipends you have to
[03:25:27.340 --> 03:25:31.340]  maintain the government code of conduct and that's what they'll be setting up and they'll have little
[03:25:31.340 --> 03:25:37.020]  minders and enforcers making sure people are uh following what they're saying in order to get
[03:25:37.020 --> 03:25:41.820]  their monthly stipend because it's hard to live you know in a place where you're taxed to the hilt
[03:25:41.820 --> 03:25:47.180]  and everything's got an extra fee on it and food's expensive and anything nice is really really
[03:25:47.180 --> 03:25:54.780]  expensive in europe i noticed that um right off the bat but uh let's go to cindy in pennsylvania
[03:25:54.780 --> 03:25:59.340]  i've got other colors too robert uh in alabama scott in illinois james and colorado kurdison
[03:25:59.340 --> 03:26:02.700]  michigan i'm going to get to all of you guys but cindy in pennsylvania wants to talk about
[03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:07.980]  bill deberg and gun control go ahead cindy yeah hi robert can i make two quick points
[03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:12.860]  sure go ahead have you ever noticed have you ever noticed when bill deberg meets there's
[03:26:12.860 --> 03:26:19.660]  always a big shoe that drops and the big shoe that dropped was orlando florida i would think
[03:26:19.660 --> 03:26:26.940]  that they were talking gun control is being their next move and making it a big move which they did
[03:26:26.940 --> 03:26:32.140]  and they probably have sleeper cells everywhere just waiting for them to make a call and i also
[03:26:32.140 --> 03:26:40.700]  wanted to mention this milo geonopolis he was taken off a twitter he had what 30 million followers
[03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:47.820]  i never heard of him before but yesterday he was um on drudge they gave a link to him and i watched
[03:26:47.820 --> 03:26:57.260]  him talk in orlando he's very articulate smart he's with the lgbt community 30 million followers
[03:26:57.260 --> 03:27:06.460]  they listened to him he's pro second amendment um if he knows gay bars or soft kill you know kill
[03:27:06.460 --> 03:27:13.100]  zones and i think it'd be a good idea to maybe interview him sometime and bring in these 30
[03:27:13.100 --> 03:27:19.660]  million people i mean pay by products too that's a lot of people yeah i would agree i don't think
[03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:25.420]  he's followed exclusively by lgbt people he's also followed by people who have a distaste in their
[03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:29.900]  mouth for the social justice warriors out there and i think that's probably his biggest audience
[03:27:29.900 --> 03:27:35.580]  um because he actually comes out against a lot of what the lgbt says in terms of
[03:27:36.140 --> 03:27:40.060]  exclusivity and trying to shut people down in their freedom of speech he's very pro freedom of
[03:27:40.060 --> 03:27:46.860]  speech and um we haven't had him on the show before but we did have joe biggs going to california
[03:27:46.860 --> 03:27:52.300]  to follow a few of his speeches and one actually got shut down due to a bomb threat that happened
[03:27:52.300 --> 03:27:57.500]  and so people don't like this guy speaking out they're very uh anti freedom of speech when it
[03:27:57.500 --> 03:28:05.260]  comes to not following their views but um yeah i i'm sure we'd love to have him on on the show and
[03:28:05.260 --> 03:28:10.540]  i think we've reached out to him alex uh regularly speaks to one of the main editors of breitbart
[03:28:10.540 --> 03:28:14.540]  and that's who he works for he's a tech editor at breitbart but as for bill bergenfall false
[03:28:14.540 --> 03:28:20.220]  flags that's what i thought we were at the airport that morning chasing the bill bergers around
[03:28:20.220 --> 03:28:27.020]  asking them questions and uh it was josh oh and saw the the headline he goes oh my god 20 people
[03:28:27.020 --> 03:28:32.780]  were just shot in orlando and i said wow this is going to take all the uh the take the eye of what
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:37.660]  people are looking at especially the eye of drudge as i say from uh bill berg which he was covering
[03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:43.740]  every day and then shift it over to this shooting and kind of take people off their real controllers
[03:28:43.740 --> 03:28:48.620]  but into an event where you could have cnn and other mainstream media outlets come out and say oh
[03:28:48.620 --> 03:28:52.620]  we got a call for guns we got a call for the bannier guns and this of course gives president
[03:28:52.620 --> 03:28:58.060]  obama the chance to get up on screen and and do his fake tears and say he's he's sick and tired of
[03:28:58.060 --> 03:29:02.140]  this and it but he won't say the words radical islam even though the last two big shootings
[03:29:02.140 --> 03:29:08.780]  were radical islam so i would agree to you on uh both points indy thanks for calling in let's go
[03:29:08.780 --> 03:29:13.900]  now to who's been waiting the longest uh looks like everybody pretty much the same curtis in
[03:29:13.900 --> 03:29:20.460]  michigan wants to talk about gun control curtis are you a gun owner yourself um i'm not a gun
[03:29:20.460 --> 03:29:26.620]  owner yet i am looking into getting the gun um but my main points are i'll keep it short uh gun
[03:29:26.620 --> 03:29:32.540]  control never works just like the drug war uh the black market um you know that's always gonna exist
[03:29:32.540 --> 03:29:37.340]  and if you if you want to shoot up a nightclub or a mall or whatever um they're gonna find a gun
[03:29:37.340 --> 03:29:41.660]  and getting it legally is irrelevant when you're i would agree hey hang on tight i'm gonna hold you
[03:29:41.660 --> 03:29:45.340]  over the break we'll come back with you and let you finish your point rob do with the fourth hour

[03:29:59.180 --> 03:30:04.060]  a british member of parliament has just been shot with a handgun and stabbed to death with a knife
[03:30:04.060 --> 03:30:09.180]  the keller got a job six years ago working in a park after being referred by mental health clinic
[03:30:09.180 --> 03:30:14.700]  he said working in the park was quote better than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world
[03:30:14.700 --> 03:30:19.180]  this happens exactly one week before the breaks at vote the referendum on whether britain will
[03:30:19.180 --> 03:30:24.060]  leave the european union a fear campaign by prime minister cameron and others has tried without
[03:30:24.060 --> 03:30:29.420]  success to scare people about economic recrimination by the bankers and the european elite if they
[03:30:29.420 --> 03:30:34.620]  leave now with poll showing leave with a clear majority and remain supporters largely apathetic
[03:30:34.620 --> 03:30:39.340]  the shooting has quickly been politicized by the media and the ruling elite to create fear of
[03:30:39.340 --> 03:30:44.380]  british nationalism and to energize the supporters of globalism they report the mentally ill men
[03:30:44.380 --> 03:30:50.220]  shouted britain first as he shot the uk got gun control decades ago and of course murder rates
[03:30:50.220 --> 03:30:55.820]  sword so it won't be used to push for gun control but it will be used to try to energize the supporters

[03:33:31.580 --> 03:33:36.940]  live at that point usually they pop in and say you're live um but the liner had finished i just
[03:33:36.940 --> 03:33:41.820]  automatically went into it but uh it's live we're live inside it's right i got david night over to
[03:33:41.820 --> 03:33:46.140]  my left we're going to talk about uh kind of what you and leon talked about a little bit last night
[03:33:46.140 --> 03:33:52.860]  what would um jesus do at the gay bar shooting a lesson in religious extremism and uh but i'm
[03:33:52.860 --> 03:33:57.740]  going to let curtis before that finish up with his gun control marcia already said you know look at
[03:33:57.740 --> 03:34:03.340]  the drug war it doesn't work uh we still have drugs you can still buy drugs i could go to 20
[03:34:03.340 --> 03:34:08.300]  different places in austin right now get whatever i want and the government outlaws it and it doesn't
[03:34:08.300 --> 03:34:13.100]  matter so when they outlaw guns the same thing will happen and is that how you want it right now it
[03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:17.260]  is sort of controlled i almost wouldn't mind a black market because then the government wouldn't
[03:34:17.260 --> 03:34:21.100]  know if i have a gun but you know right now they do a background check and the government knows
[03:34:21.100 --> 03:34:24.780]  hey this person did a background check we got to put them on a list my son said the only good thing
[03:34:24.780 --> 03:34:28.700]  about gun control gun probation is going to be you're going to see all kinds of really interesting
[03:34:28.700 --> 03:34:34.460]  guns created oh yeah never even dreamed of just like you saw all kinds of interesting new and
[03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:38.220]  very very dangerous drugs created from drug prohibition they talk about hey it's too easy to
[03:34:38.220 --> 03:34:42.620]  get it it's like yeah it's kind of like buying drugs at a school playground you can do that
[03:34:42.620 --> 03:34:47.020]  after 45 years of drug prohibition and of course nothing's going to change with guns there you go
[03:34:47.020 --> 03:34:53.020]  now hey curtis i'm gonna let you finish up go ahead uh yeah i mean david night's completely
[03:34:53.020 --> 03:34:57.980]  right uh you know the prohibition of lsd and stuff like that i'm not advocating for that but you
[03:34:57.980 --> 03:35:03.180]  know there's much more dangerous designer drugs that are much like it now and they're very dangerous
[03:35:03.180 --> 03:35:08.060]  you know um but when my point you know they take away freedom a little by little to get people
[03:35:08.060 --> 03:35:14.460]  compliant docile and for people who say that the only way to stop these shootings is for gun control
[03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:19.740]  i would respectfully disagree um i believe the stop these shootings everybody just needs to
[03:35:19.740 --> 03:35:25.180]  be armed if you want to protect yourself you need to take the measures to protect yourself um and
[03:35:25.180 --> 03:35:31.420]  that's all i got you guys do a wonderful job i'm taking my super mail um everybody buy the product
[03:35:31.420 --> 03:35:36.700]  with good stuff uh thanks for taking my call all right thank you curtis and i would advocate for
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:41.660]  you to go out and uh learn how to fire safely and get yourself a gun because you have to do that in
[03:35:41.660 --> 03:35:46.540]  this day and age it's been proven there's too many crazy people out there that don't like the fact
[03:35:47.260 --> 03:35:52.540]  that uh other people have they have different opinions you know rob to me i look at this and i
[03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:58.140]  find the watch lists far more dangerous than the guns okay watch lists are something that we've never
[03:35:58.140 --> 03:36:03.260]  had in america guns are something we always have had in america and and we've done pretty good by
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:08.300]  having guns and that's right but we're not doing too good with these secret watch lists right it
[03:36:08.300 --> 03:36:14.860]  perverts the entire bill of rights and it really causes me to concern to see the n r a as well as
[03:36:14.860 --> 03:36:19.180]  donald trump start to talk about this because that is the narrative of obama and the gun
[03:36:19.180 --> 03:36:23.580]  controllers from the left for this well hopefully when he meets with them they go sir that's not a
[03:36:23.580 --> 03:36:28.620]  good move because we don't even know how you get on these watch lists or how you get off of them
[03:36:28.620 --> 03:36:33.740]  it's no there's no due process it's a government lackey saying we don't like you remember we had a
[03:36:33.740 --> 03:36:38.540]  guy on the show who flew out of the country and then couldn't fly back in because he had gotten
[03:36:38.540 --> 03:36:42.620]  mistakenly put on one of these lists for a story i covered yeah he was somebody like this orlando
[03:36:42.620 --> 03:36:46.780]  shooter he had been vetted many many different ways he never had done anything and there was no
[03:36:46.780 --> 03:36:51.180]  reason for him to be on it but here's the thing rob we talked to him he said i never knew i was on it
[03:36:51.180 --> 03:36:54.540]  till they pulled me off the plane in hawaii said you can't fly and it's like now i'm stuck in hawaii
[03:36:54.540 --> 03:36:59.660]  i can't fly anywhere okay but he didn't know that he was on the list he didn't know why he was on the
[03:36:59.660 --> 03:37:04.380]  list he didn't know how he could get off the list where do i go to clear my name you don't sound like
[03:37:04.380 --> 03:37:09.980]  1984 sounds like 1984 we've shown clips of little kids being on the watch list i put one of those
[03:37:09.980 --> 03:37:14.940]  clips in uh police state for the rise of fema there was a little kid it was during the underwear
[03:37:14.940 --> 03:37:20.220]  bomber segment a little kid who's in ended up on the no fly list yeah okay it doesn't work it's it's
[03:37:20.220 --> 03:37:24.300]  done by the government it's not going to work right that's one thing you can rest assured the
[03:37:24.300 --> 03:37:29.740]  watch lists are far more dangerous we need watch list control yeah exactly watch list extermination
[03:37:29.740 --> 03:37:34.700]  we need government control we need less government government is the problem and it always will be
[03:37:34.700 --> 03:37:39.100]  okay government's not out there fixing your roads are making your electricity bills cheaper
[03:37:39.100 --> 03:37:43.100]  they're making everything more expensive they're making everything more bureaucratic they're making
[03:37:43.100 --> 03:37:47.980]  everything slower when i when i was in europe so many times just do you have this paper do you
[03:37:47.980 --> 03:37:52.940]  have this paper do you have this paper it was ridiculous i i was trying to pay we went and
[03:37:52.940 --> 03:38:00.620]  shot this amazing interview at this church in uh in uh the check republic and just to pay them the
[03:38:00.620 --> 03:38:06.860]  money to do this took 45 minutes of talking back and forth i was amazed i'm like jeez do you guys
[03:38:06.860 --> 03:38:10.700]  want the money or not i'm ready to go i don't want to sit here and have this conversation well
[03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:15.820]  what are you paying it for i'm paying it to go shoot the video and then they went back and forth
[03:38:15.820 --> 03:38:19.420]  because the director didn't speak english but it's just bureaucracy in action and you're
[03:38:19.420 --> 03:38:24.460]  seeing it there and it's just amazing but david let's get into what would jesus do at the gate bar
[03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:29.820]  shooting which just happened in orlando so you had this interesting concept and it's basically the
[03:38:29.820 --> 03:38:34.060]  muslims seem to be for it they seem to be on kill gaze kill gaze and now we have this extreme
[03:38:34.780 --> 03:38:39.180]  religious right who's also seem to be celebrating these killings which and i've never seen that
[03:38:39.180 --> 03:38:43.020]  before and that's something that really concerned me and you know we put this i put this title up
[03:38:43.020 --> 03:38:49.020]  you know a lot of christians see the w w jd brand of stuff at the christian bookstores okay especially
[03:38:49.020 --> 03:38:53.180]  baddest bookstores you get little bracelets that say what would jesus do you know and think about
[03:38:53.180 --> 03:38:57.660]  what you're doing would jesus be doing this that that type of thing and so i said you know what would
[03:38:57.660 --> 03:39:03.500]  jesus do at a gay bar shooting okay would he join in and and hey give me a gun i want to shoot some
[03:39:03.500 --> 03:39:10.220]  gays or would he have sacrificed himself for them okay and amazingly i saw some comments from people
[03:39:10.220 --> 03:39:14.860]  saying jesus wouldn't even be at a gay bar it's like no one of the things that he was attacked for
[03:39:14.860 --> 03:39:18.700]  during his life was the fact that he hung out with sinners he hung out with tax collectors and
[03:39:18.700 --> 03:39:25.100]  prostitutes and people why because you know what he's making a point he came to this earth to save
[03:39:25.100 --> 03:39:31.020]  sinners he and that's what christianity is about it's not about telling us that we need to kill people
[03:39:31.020 --> 03:39:35.820]  because they're sinners it's about telling people that jesus died because you're a sinner it's about
[03:39:35.820 --> 03:39:41.900]  offering a message of hope a message of freedom not a message of legalism and so yeah i've heard
[03:39:41.900 --> 03:39:46.140]  some legalistic pastors before and i've been to some legalistic churches before but i've not seen
[03:39:46.140 --> 03:39:50.620]  this type of thing and so last night we were talking about it leon was talking about it from
[03:39:50.620 --> 03:39:54.780]  the islamic side she gave me this article today a gay muslim says hey you know what islam is not
[03:39:54.780 --> 03:39:59.580]  a religion of peace he says calling islam a religion of peace is dangerous it's reductive
[03:39:59.580 --> 03:40:04.300]  like the other two monotheisms that preceded it has blood on its hands let me say this okay
[03:40:04.300 --> 03:40:10.780]  it isn't this is not just a function of monotheisms it's a function of all religions okay polytheists
[03:40:10.780 --> 03:40:15.900]  were sacrificing children doing blood sacrifices of children we've had atheists who've gone out of
[03:40:15.900 --> 03:40:21.500]  their way to murder people especially believers but also other atheists whether you believe in god or
[03:40:21.500 --> 03:40:25.340]  whether you're not there's every kind of culture every kind of religion it's got blood on it's a
[03:40:25.340 --> 03:40:29.580]  function of taking an ideology and twisting it and then saying hey it's okay to kill people that's
[03:40:29.580 --> 03:40:33.340]  right that's what it is people doing this once again once again it's people doing it not the
[03:40:33.340 --> 03:40:37.340]  guns not the religion exactly they may be doing it in the name of religion but that's not necessarily
[03:40:37.340 --> 03:40:42.860]  what the religion called for and so the real issue before us is not what has happened historically
[03:40:42.860 --> 03:40:47.660]  but what is happening now and what is the basis of islam what is the basis of christianity well
[03:40:47.660 --> 03:40:51.980]  i'm not going to try to talk about islam there's plenty of people who are muslims who will tell you
[03:40:51.980 --> 03:40:56.220]  that it is not a religion of peace that what we saw here was not a misinterpretation of
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:41:00.140]  their theology but an expression of it okay but what i'm concerned about what i want to
[03:41:00.140 --> 03:41:05.420]  talk about is reaction some of these pastors and we've got a couple of pastors uh roger Jimenez of
[03:41:05.420 --> 03:41:11.100]  verity baptist church said the killer succeeded in making orlando safer he said are you sad 50
[03:41:11.100 --> 03:41:15.900]  pedophiles are killed today uh no i think it's great he said i think that helps society i think
[03:41:15.900 --> 03:41:21.260]  orlando florida is a little safer tonight and then we got tempe Arizona preacher steven anderson
[03:41:21.260 --> 03:41:26.620]  who said well there's at least 50 less pedophiles in the world he said lgbt people
[03:41:26.620 --> 03:41:31.980]  should be executed properly however by a righteous righteous government and himine has also said i
[03:41:31.980 --> 03:41:36.940]  just wish the government would round them all up put them up against the wall put a firing squad
[03:41:36.940 --> 03:41:40.540]  in front of them and blow their brains out that's right and so what we have to be concerned about
[03:41:40.540 --> 03:41:45.340]  and that's the reason we have the first amendment we want a separation of religion from the state
[03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:50.300]  okay and i know that that's not in the constitution on that wall of separation was something that
[03:41:50.300 --> 03:41:54.780]  thomas jefferson sent out as reassurances to people who had been told by john adams and he
[03:41:54.780 --> 03:41:58.780]  was going to come around and steal their bible so they're burying him in the backyard he said no
[03:41:58.780 --> 03:42:02.860]  there's a wall that protects you from the government that's the first amendment but we don't want
[03:42:02.860 --> 03:42:08.060]  a theocracy either and what people have to understand is that islam does want a theocracy it
[03:42:08.060 --> 03:42:12.860]  is endemic to its religion and now i'm starting to see some of these same uh aspects and some of
[03:42:12.860 --> 03:42:17.260]  these christians who are preaching hey we want the government to go out and round up uh gays and
[03:42:17.260 --> 03:42:22.940]  kill them and we saw this back in the fall as they were coming to the iowa caucus remember and this
[03:42:22.940 --> 03:42:27.500]  is something i didn't even see for a couple months we had this uh meeting in demoy in iowa it was a
[03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:32.620]  national religious liberties conference uh it featured a lot of uh presidential candidates they
[03:42:32.620 --> 03:42:38.540]  had uh my cuckabee bobby jindal and ted cruz and of course as after they dropped out ted cruz as
[03:42:38.540 --> 03:42:42.300]  their people played this clip and i want to play this clip right now what this guy said
[03:42:42.300 --> 03:42:50.700]  13 calls for the death penalty for homosexuals yes
[03:42:52.380 --> 03:43:01.260]  roman's chapter 1 verse 32 the apostle paul does say that homosexuals are worthy of death
[03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:10.700]  his words not mine and i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ and let me say that is
[03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:16.540]  not the gospel of jesus christ gospel is good news what he is doing is he's taking us out of context
[03:43:16.540 --> 03:43:21.660]  completely out of context and when you take something out of context rob you use it as a pretext
[03:43:21.660 --> 03:43:26.300]  for your prejudices and that's what this man is doing that is not christianity that is not the
[03:43:26.300 --> 03:43:31.900]  gospel my cuckabee said he didn't know anything about that guy uh ted cruz did any interview
[03:43:31.900 --> 03:43:35.340]  had didn't he introduce ted cruz right after that that's right he introduced a cruise and and let me
[03:43:35.340 --> 03:43:40.780]  tell you he's quoting the bible okay and he's taking it out of context because what he says is look
[03:43:40.780 --> 03:43:46.620]  uh just before that where he says god says that all these people deserve death okay what paul is
[03:43:46.620 --> 03:43:50.380]  doing is he's laying this out a lot of people understand this they call it the roman's road
[03:43:50.380 --> 03:43:56.380]  paul says look we're all sinners we all deserve death and he goes out and he lays out this catalog
[03:43:56.380 --> 03:44:01.500]  of every possible thing you could do and it's not just homosexuality and yet these legalists will go
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:05.900]  in and they'll pull out homosexuality they'll look at it say well yeah i do that i'm a liar
[03:44:05.900 --> 03:44:10.700]  i'm a you know i do this this this but yeah i steal money i don't do homosexuality let's go
[03:44:10.700 --> 03:44:16.140]  to the homosexuals because it makes me feel like i'm justifying myself before god to attack this
[03:44:16.140 --> 03:44:20.300]  other group and so he says yeah god knows that all these people who do this deserve death but
[03:44:20.300 --> 03:44:23.980]  what did he say right before it he said they've become filled with every kind of wickedness
[03:44:23.980 --> 03:44:29.180]  with envy are we supposed to kill people who envy with murder with strife with deceit with malice
[03:44:29.180 --> 03:44:34.860]  they gossip they slander they hate god they're insolent arrogant boastful they disobey their parents
[03:44:34.860 --> 03:44:38.380]  so we're supposed to kill everybody on that list my mom must be to vote for hillary
[03:44:39.820 --> 03:44:45.260]  the whole point of this is is paul is laying down a pattern to tell people there's no such thing
[03:44:45.260 --> 03:44:51.580]  as a small sin there are no peccadillos every sin is cosmic rebellion to god and so what he's saying
[03:44:51.580 --> 03:44:57.580]  is he goes on later in in the book he says the wage all he says all have sinned and fall short of the
[03:44:57.580 --> 03:45:05.020]  glory of god and he says the wages what you deserve of sin are death but the gift of god is eternal
[03:45:05.020 --> 03:45:09.500]  life through the lord jesus christ that is what's different about christianity versus all the other
[03:45:09.500 --> 03:45:14.060]  man-made religions okay and these people are making christianity into a man-made religion
[03:45:14.060 --> 03:45:18.780]  the difference with christianity is that god offers us free grace and that there's and he
[03:45:18.780 --> 03:45:21.980]  quotes another one he quotes another one from first christians and again here's another one who he
[03:45:21.980 --> 03:45:28.860]  puts out a long list of sins fornicators okay adulterers they they're not calling for adulterers
[03:45:28.860 --> 03:45:34.380]  to be executed okay they do list homosexuals sodomites thieves covenants drunkards revilers
[03:45:34.380 --> 03:45:38.300]  extortioners none of these will inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you
[03:45:39.020 --> 03:45:43.660]  but you were justified and forgiven because of what christ did so yeah would christ be at the gay bar
[03:45:43.660 --> 03:45:48.460]  yeah he came to save sinners and so he would be there he would be with the people he would even
[03:45:48.460 --> 03:45:53.420]  be with the sinners at church okay because he came to save everybody and he was the one who
[03:45:53.420 --> 03:45:58.700]  died he doesn't call us to kill other people he doesn't call us to create a government to do that
[03:45:58.700 --> 03:46:03.420]  and i understand how it's difficult for a lot of christians to hate the sin and not hate the
[03:46:03.420 --> 03:46:08.940]  sinner because some of the people most of these sins people don't have parades to talk about
[03:46:08.940 --> 03:46:13.020]  how they're adulterers but they do have parades to talk about how they're homosexuals and so when
[03:46:13.020 --> 03:46:17.180]  we talk about this we're trying to tell people look god has got a better way for all of us we've
[03:46:17.180 --> 03:46:22.300]  all got something that we're struggling with okay but when they do that and when they come in and
[03:46:22.300 --> 03:46:27.260]  force us and coerce us now we start to get into the political realm when they start to come to
[03:46:27.260 --> 03:46:32.620]  a baker or a photographer and say you're going to come and perform at my wedding or a band you're
[03:46:32.620 --> 03:46:37.340]  going to come and perform at my wedding or i'm going to shut you down as a business that makes
[03:46:37.340 --> 03:46:42.940]  them very angry and i have to say to them christians need to rise above that yes we need to fight that
[03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:47.660]  kind of hatred we need to fight it politically but we don't need to use religion to do that we
[03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:52.300]  don't need to pervert the gospel of christ that's not the good news and we need to protect our kids
[03:46:52.300 --> 03:46:57.260]  as well from and i'm not saying all gays are like that but you do have pedophiles out there that we
[03:46:57.260 --> 03:47:01.900]  must protect our kids from yeah let's go to scott in illinois and get his reaction to that he
[03:47:01.900 --> 03:47:06.700]  lists himself as a radical christian scott what's your take on what david night just had to say
[03:47:06.700 --> 03:47:14.540]  oh i'd just say amen to everything don't need to repeat it all but uh i i i told you
[03:47:14.540 --> 03:47:20.540]  your call screener that my friends consider me radical i don't label myself as radical
[03:47:20.540 --> 03:47:26.140]  but when my friends have problems they come to me tell me their problems i listen and i pray
[03:47:26.140 --> 03:47:32.780]  and i ask for jesus you know to uh to help them or i ask the holy spirit to help them and uh
[03:47:32.780 --> 03:47:40.620]  uh you know uh thanks for taking my call it's a real interesting topic and i just feel really
[03:47:40.620 --> 03:47:44.860]  really sad that there are people that call themselves christians whether they're radical
[03:47:44.860 --> 03:47:51.660]  or not that that would say that it's the right thing to do and go kill gay people that is not
[03:47:51.660 --> 03:47:59.100]  and where would jesus be the jesus that i serve he would be there at that nightclub raising those
[03:47:59.100 --> 03:48:04.460]  people from the dead now i don't know where the chicken hearted christians were that were not
[03:48:04.460 --> 03:48:10.460]  down there ministering to these people after this slaughter that's a good point i mean
[03:48:11.180 --> 03:48:18.540]  and my goodness i mean i know billy billy graham's still alive i'd be you know this is a spiritual
[03:48:18.540 --> 03:48:25.740]  problem and you just can't if we took all the crooked bankers and took all the cook warriors
[03:48:25.740 --> 03:48:31.900]  and took all the crooked judges and took all the crooked police department and took all the crooked
[03:48:31.900 --> 03:48:37.020]  military we just took all the crooks and lined them up like somebody said and and machine gunned
[03:48:37.020 --> 03:48:44.220]  them down it wouldn't solve the problem because it's a spiritual problem satan is the cancer
[03:48:44.220 --> 03:48:52.380]  and jesus is the answer it is not buddha muhammad or uh christian and i'm not opposed to having
[03:48:52.380 --> 03:48:58.700]  those people live in my neighborhood what i am opposed to is giving them free passes and making
[03:48:58.700 --> 03:49:04.620]  them have special rights that my goodness if i went out and had a prayer meeting on rush street
[03:49:04.620 --> 03:49:11.260]  which is in chicago uh 45 minutes less than 40 minutes from my house if i would take political
[03:49:11.260 --> 03:49:17.660]  action and uh try and close down that street uh you had some guy in the on the uh your program
[03:49:17.660 --> 03:49:23.980]  the other day you know it's it's radical it's political islam that is our enemy that's our
[03:49:23.980 --> 03:49:31.740]  spiritual enemy and they're trying to use political islam is trying to use our our religious freedoms
[03:49:31.740 --> 03:49:38.700]  our social freedoms um you know if you are a christian you can't harbor hate for people you
[03:49:38.700 --> 03:49:45.740]  can harbor hate for sin that's what my bible says you have to hate the sin and not the people
[03:49:45.740 --> 03:49:51.820]  jesus wouldn't be down there uh scott help and scott you're on a roll thanks for calling in that
[03:49:51.820 --> 03:49:58.220]  was uh that was great and it's a this is not a topic that's really it it is cut and dry but
[03:49:58.220 --> 03:50:02.220]  it's not cut and dry in the way you've been talking about it you know nobody's really talking about
[03:50:02.220 --> 03:50:07.260]  it from that angle well you know when i look at what steven anderson said he says uh the bad news
[03:50:07.260 --> 03:50:11.500]  is that these homosexuals still live they're going to be attacking christians and they're going to be
[03:50:11.500 --> 03:50:15.420]  pushing gun control well they're going to use what he said to push gun control they're going to use
[03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:19.900]  what he said to attack christians politically and to shut down our freedoms this is something
[03:50:19.900 --> 03:50:25.020]  that that made me very angry at the libertarian party gary johnson got booed when he said yes
[03:50:25.020 --> 03:50:29.260]  you should be able to compel somebody who doesn't want to bake a cake for you or take your picture
[03:50:29.260 --> 03:50:33.980]  or plate your wedding you should be able to compel them to do that he was booed by libertarians
[03:50:33.980 --> 03:50:37.740]  not christians and i don't agree with that either i don't think you should be crossing the line that's
[03:50:37.740 --> 03:50:41.500]  your right why would you want somebody to bake your cake if they don't want to that's right would you
[03:50:41.500 --> 03:50:45.340]  want that they're gonna put a little extra baking soda in it they don't want it they just want to punish

[03:55:54.300 --> 03:55:57.500]  college professor's telling you it's going to work it's not going to work because you're going to
[03:55:57.500 --> 03:56:01.420]  run out of other people's money in the end and that is the plain hard truth david night utopian
[03:56:01.420 --> 03:56:05.340]  vision that doesn't exist it is and bernie sanders doesn't understand that and unfortunately there's
[03:56:05.340 --> 03:56:09.500]  a lot of his supporters who don't understand it yeah but they'll find out and maybe if they get
[03:56:09.500 --> 03:56:13.100]  they should move to one of these countries james and colorado no fly list yeah 30 seconds go
[03:56:14.860 --> 03:56:19.740]  yeah i just wanted to add that uh if you look at obama's legislation it said not only will the fbi
[03:56:19.740 --> 03:56:24.780]  be in charge of the list but the attorney general of the justice department as well all things started
[03:56:24.780 --> 03:56:30.300]  with diane feinstein a week after the paris attack he said this national security conference we
[03:56:30.300 --> 03:56:35.900]  have to have this and then the day before they voted on it you had to stand bernadino uh i don't
[03:56:35.900 --> 03:56:40.060]  know what to call that i think there's a lot going on there but when there's the whole plan
[03:56:40.060 --> 03:56:46.140]  tfr's involved and all the rest oh yeah exactly and it's just another way to control us by put
[03:56:46.140 --> 03:56:51.180]  by not letting us travel watch this is the worst of orwell in kofka and the star chambers that were
[03:56:51.180 --> 03:56:57.020]  that exist exactly robert in alabama on gun control go ahead sir well i i got to start this

[03:57:04.460 --> 03:57:12.860]  because uh i lost some guys over there that went on a patrol okay they were killed we went back later
[03:57:12.860 --> 03:57:18.620]  on and there was a mosque um and we and i asked my interpreter i said what are they talking about
[03:57:18.620 --> 03:57:23.900]  and they were talking about we're a bunch of infidels and everything and and the mosque was
[03:57:23.900 --> 03:57:30.220]  on me he goes they're preaching radical islam and my interpreter which was iraqi at the time
