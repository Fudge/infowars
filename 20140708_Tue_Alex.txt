[00:34.560 --> 00:39.640]  some breaking news from California as we have up on Infowars.com Mexican flag wearing
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.680]  La Raza militants arrive in Murrieta California this is the place where there's a standoff
[00:44.680 --> 00:49.880]  between citizens who are protesting the 140 immigrants that are going to be brought in
[00:49.880 --> 00:56.040]  every 72 hours into the place by our government importing the immigrants so they've pushed
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.640]  back against that they've stopped the importation now three times so the federal government is
[01:01.640 --> 01:06.840]  bringing in reinforcements they're bringing in La Raza we also have Infowars reporters there and
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.320]  we're going to be talking to them later on in the show we've got Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs who has
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.080]  already been threatened by some of these people of course there's also interviews with some other
[01:15.080 --> 01:21.720]  Hispanics there who point out that La Raza is a Hispanic KKK and Alex is going to be joining us
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.440]  in just one second but before we go to him also we're going to have Jerome Corsi later on in
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.560]  the program he's going to be pointing out what only W&D and Infowars has been pointing out and
[01:30.560 --> 01:37.520]  that is the establishment believes that America is finished this is the beginning of North America
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.080]  as an established fact the North American Union both Petraeus and Pelosi have openly said that
[01:43.080 --> 01:47.920]  Corsi wrote an article about it yesterday we pointed it out a couple weeks ago when Petraeus
[01:47.920 --> 01:53.080]  first said that in London but going now to Alex Jones Alex that's right my friend joining
[01:53.080 --> 02:02.400]  you via audio skype but I'll be back live tomorrow and throughout the week and next Sunday when it
[02:02.400 --> 02:09.360]  rains it pours I've had some more family issues and another death in the family so I think we
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.560]  just lost him there on the phone but we're going to have him back we're going to establish re-establish
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.560]  connection I wanted to bring you up with what's going on with this Mexican flag wearing La Raza
[02:19.560 --> 02:24.200]  militants article there Murrieta of course they say that they're there to protect the children you
[02:24.200 --> 02:28.780]  understand of course that Obama says that the children that are being protected under the Dream
[02:28.780 --> 02:35.160]  Act is anyone up to the age of 31 years old yes that's what's happening we've also got other
[02:35.160 --> 02:42.840]  articles that are going to be talking about HHS is muscling the media and tours of an Oklahoma
[02:42.840 --> 02:47.480]  facility and we've reported on this before that Congressman Bridenstine has gone there he was
[02:47.480 --> 02:54.640]  concerned about the welfare of the children and rightfully so how do children get across a continent
[02:54.640 --> 03:00.360]  unaccompanied as minors very young minors who's bringing them in who are they being turned over
[03:00.360 --> 03:06.800]  to well when he went to the facility the military facility he was told that he couldn't enter even
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.400]  after he told them he was a US Congressman now they're threatening the media saying that they can
[03:12.400 --> 03:18.480]  come in but they can't talk to any of the kids they can't record anything and he's saying this is
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.640]  not a free country and of course our reporter kid Daniels was threatened with arrest because we
[03:23.640 --> 03:28.560]  took pictures from outside of Lackland Air Force based down in San Antonio where this was happening
[03:28.560 --> 03:33.960]  this is not even just limited to journalists and congressmen of course they're threatening the
[03:33.960 --> 03:39.360]  public that's what's going on in Murrieta you see ice and others are pushing back against the
[03:39.360 --> 03:44.760]  public who is protesting it and in Dallas they're doing it proactively we're gonna have a clip
[03:44.760 --> 03:51.240]  coming up from a Dallas judge who has gone door to door before the immigrants have been shipped
[03:51.240 --> 03:56.280]  into an abandoned school they're telling people that well you can protest but you better do it
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.880]  within the law and of course Dallas is one of the places with the most restrictions on free
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.960]  speech whether it was the George Bush Library protests whether it was the Info Wars and Alex
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.280]  Jones protesting the shutting down of free speech on the JFK anniversary the 50th anniversary of
[04:11.280 --> 04:17.760]  the assassination in both of those cases Dallas pushed back they shut down free speech they've
[04:17.760 --> 04:23.840]  extended their rules to protests that are within 75 feet of a road now of course interfering with
[04:23.840 --> 04:28.280]  transportation was not an issue at either those protests either the George Bush Library protest
[04:28.280 --> 04:34.200]  or the JFK assassination event neither those were anywhere near a facility but they're using that
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.040]  as a pretense as they do all over the country we're gonna be right back with more updates from
[04:39.040 --> 04:44.080]  Alex Jones and from our reporters in California as well as Jerome Corsi stay with us we'll be

[08:37.080 --> 08:43.160]  that's of course the place where protesters are protesting the fact that 140 illegal immigrants
[08:43.160 --> 08:49.080]  are being flown in every 72 hours they've turned away a couple of shipments and so reinforcements
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.080]  have arrived from the federal government i guess we could say la raza because they're trying to play
[08:53.080 --> 08:59.320]  this up as a race versus race issue how better to do that with la raza but we also have info wars
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.080]  reporters who have arrived on the scene we're going to be talking to them later in the day
[09:03.080 --> 09:07.000]  we have two reporters on the scene and we're going to be talking to them separately uh
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.160]  staff sergeant joe biggs as well as jacari jackson and we're going to be joined by
[09:11.160 --> 09:16.600]  jerome coursey in the third hour he's going to talk about what is really behind all of this this
[09:16.600 --> 09:22.920]  is really the collapse of america and on the phone we have alex jones alex this is the collapse of
[09:22.920 --> 09:31.320]  america isn't it uh yes it is david and i'm still getting the music in my ear just everybody knows
[09:31.320 --> 09:39.960]  there it's a network okay we got it hello alex i think we lost him we've got a little bit of a
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.800]  phone issue there now another breaking news we're going to reestablish connection we're
[09:43.800 --> 09:49.240]  going to get alex right back because he wanted to uh cover what's going on there is a tremendous
[09:49.240 --> 09:54.840]  amount of information that is coming out now uh in the immigration area we've got the la pd is
[09:54.840 --> 10:01.480]  going to halt the tension of undocumented immigrants at the request of ice now of course the la pd
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.720]  is saying you know we we've got more important things to do than to uh hold people coming into
[10:05.720 --> 10:12.360]  the country in waves of massive immigration what we're really concerned about is getting drugs
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.280]  off the street stopping gun violence so on behalf of our taxpayers we're going to say
[10:16.280 --> 10:22.120]  no more well you know actually drugs are the central problem if you're looking at the collapsing
[10:22.120 --> 10:29.000]  countries uh in central and south america where there is so much violence it's because of our war
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.800]  on drugs and it's because they have no firearms of course in those countries and so the people
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.920]  in those countries with a few exceptions of the places where you've got uh mexican provinces
[10:38.920 --> 10:44.040]  where militias have formed to stand up against the corrupt government against the drug lords there
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.080]  with the exception of those areas they're essentially at the mercy of the drug war just
[10:49.080 --> 10:56.040]  like we saw in chicago this last weekend we had uh 82 people shot and 14 people killed in chicago
[10:56.040 --> 11:03.480]  why because of drug wars that's what we've been told many times by law enforcement by judges
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.560]  we've interviewed uh jim gearock with law enforcement against prohibitions several times on
[11:07.560 --> 11:12.920]  this show he's a former prosecutor out of chicago he knows that area very well he says 80 percent
[11:13.480 --> 11:18.120]  of the shootings in chicago at least when he was there up to the point of about five years ago
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.800]  we're we're drug lid and i just hear that we've got alex jones back alex can you hear us
[11:24.360 --> 11:29.720]  yep third time's the charm hopefully uh again ladies and gentlemen we have our reporters
[11:29.720 --> 11:37.400]  uh down there on at the border in southern california right now in marietta and uh reported
[11:37.400 --> 11:45.080]  Lee uh joe biggs one of our reporters uh has been basically uh threatened a threat on his life
[11:45.080 --> 11:52.520]  that's coming up at the bottom of this hour with jacari jackson joe biggs and we're also have
[11:53.080 --> 12:00.360]  staff reporter kit dangles and of course josh owens they're with you who famously got that
[12:00.360 --> 12:09.640]  footage uh when the feds back down with that situation uh out in the bundy situation in nevada
[12:10.840 --> 12:16.920]  now again ladies and gentlemen this is all part of a larger program to implode the united states
[12:16.920 --> 12:23.640]  into the north american union out of crises they will build their new world order order out of chaos
[12:23.640 --> 12:30.200]  is the plan and the narrative is that this is just about democratic voters and the narrative is
[12:30.200 --> 12:35.960]  this is about cloward and piven and more more you know socialism and more dependency and that's
[12:35.960 --> 12:43.240]  part of it but the larger issue is bringing in a major crisis that is a smoke screen for the feds
[12:43.240 --> 12:50.200]  to federalize the western states and other states that are on the verge of financial collapse
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.880]  so this is about driving the entire country into the type of downward spiral we've seen in
[12:55.880 --> 13:03.000]  detroit this is the globalist program this is what they do this is what they've done all over the
[13:03.000 --> 13:12.600]  world and they are advertising for ms 13 la raza mecha the literal dregs of southern north america
[13:12.600 --> 13:19.000]  mexico central america guatemala south and then of course south america and even vice
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.000]  documentaries on hpo just show the incredible crime the drug addicts the the leprosy the the
[13:27.720 --> 13:35.640]  just the diseases which is just now pouring across the border and this is being done by design
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.640]  and now we have the bomb shell information up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[13:41.640 --> 13:50.920]  obama gives marietta area ice agents stand-down order cloward and piven strategy in full swing
[13:50.920 --> 13:56.600]  and if you remember it's not just paul joseph watson's new article it's the border patrol union
[13:56.600 --> 14:03.240]  president and vice president one of which you've interviewed david who were on record ladies and
[14:03.240 --> 14:09.960]  gentlemen uh saying that three months ago they were given a stand-down order from san diego uh to
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.480]  mcowan texas from southern california to texas and they're told stand-down they'll pick up trash go
[14:15.480 --> 14:21.240]  do something else reinforcements are coming so they never have ever to put on paper that they've
[14:21.240 --> 14:29.640]  actually ordered a full stand-down but this is the greatest definition of high treason by the president
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.640]  and the criminals that control the democratic party and they want to exploit the giant immigrant
[14:35.640 --> 14:42.200]  population out of central south america and mexico who the political class the big banks but right
[14:42.200 --> 14:50.200]  down to the quote la rosa mecha chicano leaders and the law firms that serve them literally feed on
[14:50.200 --> 14:56.760]  this population and literally use this population as a black market mules not just for drugs but
[14:56.760 --> 15:02.040]  for money laundering you name it and so the huge drug war we've seen in mexico against different
[15:02.040 --> 15:09.160]  drug cartels controlled by different federal and global agencies the cia backing la sedizan record
[15:09.160 --> 15:15.320]  that's come out in federal court is now spilling across india united states and just like the cia
[15:15.320 --> 15:21.000]  imported cocaine in the 80s this has been declassified to destabilize the united states came out in
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.200]  iran contra this is a much wider scale just like they're importing jihadis by the hundreds of thousands
[15:28.200 --> 15:35.480]  uh out of the caucuses out of saudi arabia qatar and pakistan and afghanistan to wreak havoc from
[15:35.480 --> 15:41.560]  northern africa to central africa to western africa so then north com has an excuse to move in and
[15:41.560 --> 15:48.280]  take over or african then they're expanding that into the middle east with syria they're expanding
[15:48.280 --> 15:56.040]  that now into iraq on record this is a grand destabilization program and so it's the same thing
[15:56.040 --> 16:01.640]  that we see worldwide the new world order use the same strategy of destabilization balkanization
[16:02.760 --> 16:07.400]  on a planetary scale and even though i had a bunch of family issues and things i have to take care
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.360]  of today i literally couldn't sleep last night and here i am calling into my own show today
[16:12.920 --> 16:17.160]  we've got dr jerome coursey coming up to break down how they're bringing in the north american
[16:17.160 --> 16:20.760]  union we've got david night with his excellent analysis to break it down we're gonna have our
[16:20.760 --> 16:26.200]  reporters at the bottom of the hour and then later in the broadcast covering the purposeful
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.880]  collapse of our border into the north american union and the north american security perimeter
[16:32.760 --> 16:38.440]  search north american security perimeter it's from mexico to alaska they implode the internal
[16:38.440 --> 16:46.200]  borders then set up a federalization multinationalization after they have already created the crisis
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.720]  and they said in the secret documents of the judicial lawsuit to god in 2007 that we cover an
[16:51.720 --> 16:58.920]  end game that they would use border crises and collapse that's why we knew this was coming
[16:58.920 --> 17:05.160]  to bring in the north american union they also said flu or other superbugs which we now see coming
[17:05.160 --> 17:10.680]  out of latin america other areas where antibiotics are sold on the shelves that's just on record and
[17:10.680 --> 17:17.400]  terrorism and so what does this do we have record numbers of real icis geotics pouring across the
[17:17.400 --> 17:23.640]  southern border uh we have link-ups with the mexican mafia doing this we have the cia using all
[17:23.640 --> 17:29.480]  this is cutouts we have wells fargo and wankovia in bloomberg caught running the aircraft and
[17:29.480 --> 17:37.160]  laundering 300 plus billion dollars folks look it up i'm not joking this is a major massive global
[17:37.160 --> 17:42.600]  organized crime operation that in the end will scapegoat the poor latin americans and mexicans
[17:42.600 --> 17:47.720]  who are just living in desperate hell and who i don't blame trying to come up here and get the
[17:47.720 --> 17:54.040]  welfare and the kickbacks all of it's submitted together though with race politics energizing
[17:54.040 --> 18:00.920]  hispanics uh into hispanic kukluks clan cadre because that's such a successful political process
[18:00.920 --> 18:06.600]  just like our government british intelligence funded adolf hitler that's declassified came out in
[18:06.600 --> 18:12.200]  the congressional hearings uh the church committees the mccormick dix team committees
[18:12.200 --> 18:18.600]  again look it up my film in game actually has the newsreels of the committees where our government
[18:18.600 --> 18:24.920]  put hitler in to then wreck europe blow everything up then they took him out so again they will end
[18:24.920 --> 18:32.200]  up taking out the mexican mafia and ms 13 and all these groups when they're done conquering america
[18:32.200 --> 18:37.960]  and our border patrol is fighting a real threat see just like our troops fight real al-qaeda
[18:37.960 --> 18:43.320]  overseas and get maimed and killed we're not saying ms 13 or al-qaeda isn't real we're saying it's
[18:43.320 --> 18:49.080]  being loosed it's being controlled it's being funded it's being allowed to operate through the big
[18:49.080 --> 18:53.480]  banks it's being and that's why obama is coming to austin and our great team is going to be covering

[24:26.840 --> 24:34.440]  breaking news on our criminal occupied government literally dissolving the border and ordering
[24:34.440 --> 24:40.840]  eyes to stand down and calling in riot police to go out for us citizens and again the poor
[24:40.840 --> 24:45.720]  populations of latin america are being used as pawns on average they're not racist they don't
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.400]  hate america they dream of coming here and they're hardworking people this is the democrats the
[24:51.400 --> 24:57.640]  globalist the council on farm relations and the republican party leadership working with them to
[24:57.640 --> 25:02.680]  try to get the welfare queens of latin america and the world to come here to be part of a new
[25:02.680 --> 25:08.760]  political class but that's a side issue to the greater crisis here this larger mass is allowed
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.040]  to get in and the president said this will bring an even bigger wave as we've said if they give 30
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.880]  million illegals amnesty and the amnesty says then their families can come it'll be a domino
[25:19.880 --> 25:25.720]  effect where tens of millions a year will come not just millions and the country's already bankrupt
[25:25.720 --> 25:32.680]  by every metric and that is the plant but not just financially bankrupt absolute crazy town
[25:32.680 --> 25:39.160]  in the streets while citizens cleaning guns in their own garage are being swapped team because
[25:39.160 --> 25:44.840]  the neighbor sees a gun in rural tennessee uh... or in rural illinois i mean they're training
[25:44.840 --> 25:51.240]  spy on your neighbors uh... streetlight microphones to listen to everyone nsa spy on everybody and
[25:51.240 --> 25:57.240]  then patreus and polosi hide it plain view those clips are coming up and say this is about the
[25:57.240 --> 26:04.040]  north american union yes a hellish north american union where where we don't live mexico up we all
[26:04.040 --> 26:11.400]  collapse this is the plan and it just illustrates how everything is a giant fraud and then you get
[26:12.120 --> 26:18.440]  these bizarre communists they're openly communist brown berets funded by the fort foundation
[26:19.080 --> 26:25.800]  showing up threatening people shooting their mouths off uh... holding up pictures of uh
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.880]  water brought people's heads chopped off we have video of that uh...
[26:29.880 --> 26:36.440]  uh... saying we're gonna get the evil you know the white people and then the media covers this up
[26:36.440 --> 26:43.240]  and this is the media and robert rodriguez and everybody holds up as the leaders of hispanics
[26:43.240 --> 26:51.800]  is a bunch of game-banging xcon because they are identical except for skin color in my view
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.720]  to the client i mean they're literally poor dumb mindless racist people and so they train
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.880]  americans not to be tribal or racist because all groups are like this at a primitive level
[27:02.520 --> 27:07.080]  and then if you like if you went to a biker gang and just showed up said you remember they throw
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.400]  you out or you showed up at a you know private black club and showed up you know and and and you
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.920]  weren't even for the neighborhood where black they throw you out or white that's basic club or or gang
[27:16.920 --> 27:22.760]  mentality humans have and so again they they get rid of our gang mentality in america then they
[27:22.760 --> 27:28.760]  create hardcore gang mentalities in groups export them in and america has no political will to deal
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.880]  with it the political system thinks we're in such a coma that they will allow obama care to wreck
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.280]  the country they will allow open borders to wreck the country they will openly fund al-qaeda to take
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.000]  over the middle east in africa they will openly give them stinger missiles they will openly put
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.120]  our military interneato command i mean david night if they will get away with this what do you
[27:48.120 --> 27:54.360]  think's next i'll tell you giant false flags blamed on the liberty movement i mean this is the age

[32:11.320 --> 32:17.240]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most americans spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[32:17.240 --> 32:22.520]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand
[32:22.520 --> 32:27.000]  types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.720]  million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics
[32:31.720 --> 32:37.480]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[32:37.480 --> 32:42.360]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated

[33:08.360 --> 33:21.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[33:25.880 --> 33:30.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is david knight and austin we were just talking to alex
[33:30.600 --> 33:36.280]  jones via via phone he was breaking down what is going on at our borders well it is the collapse
[33:36.280 --> 33:42.840]  of america we had david patrice saying famously a couple of weeks ago in london what comes after
[33:42.840 --> 33:49.160]  america that's easy north america he broke it down it's all about nafta and of course jerome
[33:49.160 --> 33:53.560]  coursey has picked us up at world net daily we're going to have him on in the third hour of the show
[33:53.560 --> 33:58.520]  to break that down but one of the places where this has come to a head of course is in myrietta
[33:58.520 --> 34:04.280]  california this is where the population came out and said enough if you're not going to protect the
[34:04.280 --> 34:10.440]  borders if you're not going to stand by the law we're going to show up and stop this importation
[34:10.440 --> 34:16.040]  of people they're bringing in 140 people every 72 hours that's the plan so they showed up and
[34:16.040 --> 34:21.080]  they've stopped this now i believe it's three times we have sent info wars reporters there
[34:21.080 --> 34:26.440]  we're going to be going to them in just a second but of course obama is telling the local area
[34:26.440 --> 34:31.640]  ice agents that's immigration control is what they say are immigration and customs enforcement
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.800]  that's what they say it's about but of course it's not about that at all he's now told them to
[34:35.800 --> 34:41.480]  stand down what's going on with that well of course it is part of a clowered and piven strategy
[34:41.480 --> 34:47.560]  obama is incentivizing this massive immigration here and this is part of it but another question
[34:47.560 --> 34:53.160]  is maybe he's going to bring in a different kind of police one that's not necessarily focused on
[34:53.160 --> 34:57.880]  illegal immigrants but one that is focused on the protesters so we're going to be talking to them
[34:57.880 --> 35:03.080]  see what developments are coming up before we go to jacari jackson and staff sergeant joe biggs
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.440]  we're going to tell you that this hour of the alex jones show is brought to you by a special that
[35:08.440 --> 35:14.920]  we've got going at our website this is a special on survival shield x2 and fluoride shield two bottles
[35:14.920 --> 35:21.080]  of our best formula for only 30 off in our super detox special a very limited time only while
[35:21.080 --> 35:26.840]  supplies last get the fluoride out with our fluoride shield formula by itself for 25 off
[35:26.840 --> 35:33.400]  at info wars life dot com your support is what allows us to run this operation to send reporters
[35:33.400 --> 35:39.480]  to cover the hot spots and this is a hot spot in murieta everybody is looking at this to see
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.920]  what is going on is the government going to come against the american citizens or they're going to
[35:44.920 --> 35:49.640]  support what they believe as john bound has put it the illegal citizens because they are treating
[35:49.640 --> 35:55.560]  them as if they are citizens let's go to jacari jackson and murieta california jacari hey how
[35:55.560 --> 35:59.880]  you doing david wow here murieta california right in front of the border patrol base here
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.120]  and this location staff sergeant joe biggs kid daniels and our cameraman joce we're out here
[36:04.120 --> 36:09.560]  trying to document the illegal immigration influx into the united states of america now out here
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.320]  we see fox newt is out here we saw seeing in at our hotel earlier today and so people are interested
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.120]  in this story but they want to tell it their own way they want to say it's the humanitarian crisis
[36:20.120 --> 36:23.880]  it's all these children and it's everything's for the children and of course we want these children
[36:23.880 --> 36:29.960]  to have good education safety health care and so forth but you know use this analogy let's say
[36:29.960 --> 36:34.120]  you have a boat and your boat only holds about 10 people but then you open up your borders or
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.960]  open up your boat and now you got 20 people now you got 30 people now you got 50 people
[36:37.960 --> 36:41.800]  and the boat is sinking to the bottom and that's exactly what's happening here in the united states
[36:41.800 --> 36:45.480]  of america it's not that we don't want these people to have you know all the things that i
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.240]  just mentioned we just can't really support all these people because you think about san
[36:49.240 --> 36:55.400]  burrito california uh the county and they had a back in 2009 about 60 million dollars allocated
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.040]  to welfare welfare resources for illegal immigrants and that's not even counting about their own
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.280]  people their own legal people uh because you talk about the veterans who are not getting the health
[37:04.280 --> 37:09.560]  care and all the other things well now i want them jacari they just they just we just reported on
[37:09.560 --> 37:15.480]  info wars dot com that the white house is now asking for 3.8 billion dollars for the children
[37:15.480 --> 37:19.320]  the children of the border wasn't enough day because you remember it was 2 billion i said okay
[37:19.320 --> 37:23.720]  that's not enough so let's bump it up to three plus billion and that's just right now while
[37:23.720 --> 37:27.480]  they're at the border it's going to get much more expensive as we educate them and of course
[37:27.480 --> 37:31.960]  they're going to get benefits that far exceed what american citizens and american taxpayers
[37:31.960 --> 37:36.120]  have been given they're going to be able to get in-state tuition at any state they want to go to
[37:36.120 --> 37:39.640]  not just at a state where they've been paying taxes they're going to be able to get it anywhere
[37:39.640 --> 37:45.080]  and be able to get full ride tuition of course american students will have to go into debt to
[37:45.080 --> 37:49.880]  become indentured servants to the banks to the government if they want to get a college education
[37:49.880 --> 37:54.520]  but these people can just come in and the dreamers will get it and of course the dreamers includes
[37:55.080 --> 38:00.200]  anybody who's coming in now i think that's really what's changed this was put in the dream act was
[38:00.200 --> 38:06.280]  put in about two years ago but what they've made it clear is that this is not going to be retroactive
[38:06.280 --> 38:11.080]  but it's going to be proactive to anyone who wants to come in now or in the future is going to get
[38:11.080 --> 38:16.360]  this massive benefit so it's an enticement and he's actually endangering children where that's
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.880]  a benefit that we don't get myself being a homo resident or from oklahoma i go down to texas i
[38:21.880 --> 38:26.440]  don't get in-state tuition so but people from el salvador people from mexico they can come
[38:26.440 --> 38:30.120]  and get the benefits that i can't i mean that doesn't seem fair to me and you know when he
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.280]  comes down to brass tax you know who's ultimately going to pay for all this in-state tuition you
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.680]  know obama's not opening up his private bank account to fund all this stuff it's going to come from
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.800]  taxpayers people like you and me people uh in san brodino california but david we have the article
[38:43.800 --> 38:49.080]  on info wars dot com uh paul joseph wants a new news article and he's talking about how the ice
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.120]  agents are being told to stand down from obama and i can absolutely believe that because we've seen
[38:54.120 --> 38:58.840]  the board patrol our and with our own eyes in the state of texas i wouldn't so much say the people
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.000]  we talked to said they were so much ordered to stand down but they're definitely not doing a uh
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.440]  uh adequate job well these guys to the border these guys are marietta these guys and marietta
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.760]  chicare have been told that they're on temporary leave with full benefit so they're still paying
[39:12.760 --> 39:15.880]  them they just say they don't want them to do anything i mean you can't be more obvious this
[39:15.880 --> 39:21.080]  is a collect vacation it's a paid vacation but when we go to the border david in uh texas
[39:21.080 --> 39:24.280]  you know you go to the board patrol and they want to check you like are you american citizen they
[39:24.280 --> 39:28.120]  want to bring the dog out sniff your car i'm like well you guys know what the illegal immigrants
[39:28.120 --> 39:32.040]  are they know what the illegal immigrants illegal immigrants are in texas they know what they are
[39:32.040 --> 39:36.360]  in california but they want to harass you the american citizen you know it's like can i get
[39:36.360 --> 39:40.920]  the same benefits as everybody else or as these illegal immigrants they're treating illegal immigrants
[39:40.920 --> 39:44.120]  better than the united states of america than they're treating people like me treating people
[39:44.120 --> 39:48.280]  like staff sergeant joe biggs has to wait two months to get an appointment at the ba for internal
[39:48.280 --> 39:52.360]  injuries and stuff it's completely ridiculous yeah i want to get uh staff sergeant joe biggs
[39:52.360 --> 39:56.120]  is taking on it thanks jacar we're going to come back to you later in the show uh but you know
[39:56.120 --> 40:00.200]  talking about the va this is another article that just came up on info wars yesterday long
[40:00.200 --> 40:07.080]  wait times in california emergency rooms are blamed on obama care well what's going to happen
[40:07.080 --> 40:13.800]  when all these people that obama is bringing in go on to obama care go into the emergency room
[40:13.800 --> 40:18.520]  what's going to happen with that well of course that's part of the clowered and piven strategy
[40:18.520 --> 40:23.160]  to collapse the country with the welfare state now they're trying to say that this is about
[40:23.160 --> 40:29.960]  compassion and yet we see that obama is incentivizing these children to come across we know that uh
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.320]  in dallas they're trying to preemptively stop what happened in murietta where info wars reporters
[40:35.320 --> 40:41.000]  are in california they don't want people they're protesting the immigration influx is going to
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.920]  be brought in and staged in that area so we had a judge that was going door to door threatening
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.440]  people saying well you know of course you've got free speech but you better obey the law
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.880]  and part of that interview and that was a story that was put up by the mainstream media up in
[40:55.880 --> 41:03.640]  dallas they had a quote from a guy who said hey you're a grown-up don't protest a kid this is not
[41:03.640 --> 41:10.280]  about protecting kids this is about endangering children obama is incentivizing this when you
[41:10.280 --> 41:16.040]  have a congressman like brydenstein in oklahoma go to the facility to see what's going on to see
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.720]  if there's child trafficking going on that's a legitimate question how do very young unaccompanied
[41:21.720 --> 41:26.520]  minors get all the way across a couple of a continent from central and south america
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.880]  to the united states how do they do that how do they get across the desert where are they going
[41:31.880 --> 41:38.200]  who are they being turned into the congressman has had experience with child trafficking a lot of
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.880]  these children are dying they're getting raped they're being turned over into child trafficking
[41:41.880 --> 41:47.720]  he wanted to see what was going on but he was sent away now also in murietta we have staff sergeant
[41:47.720 --> 41:54.840]  joe begs staff sergeant what do you see there hello i don't guess we've got him just yet
[41:55.480 --> 41:58.760]  one of the things that we're seeing is that there's an immigration crisis there we go there's
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.200]  there's joe begs go ahead joe hey uh how are you doing david joe what do you see there joe
[42:04.200 --> 42:10.840]  and murietta uh well one thing i see is a group of people a town come together and stand up and
[42:10.840 --> 42:15.480]  say you know what enough is enough we're not you're not going to bankrupt our town bringing
[42:15.480 --> 42:20.760]  these immigrant these alien children into our town whatsoever i mean it's a beautiful thing to see
[42:20.760 --> 42:25.160]  americans and patriots come out here and stand up or something like that but you know the funny
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.640]  thing is though they're going to be with the ones that are called terrorists meanwhile last night
[42:29.640 --> 42:35.720]  on the proamnesty side there's gang bangers out here and yesterday they have la raza out here
[42:35.720 --> 42:41.080]  one of the uh mexican american anti-immigration uh guys i talked to you last night mr garza
[42:41.080 --> 42:48.040]  he said that you know la raza is indeed the mexican kkk and they want no part of that
[42:48.040 --> 42:53.640]  so you know they actually call themselves the race so i mean you couldn't be more explicitly
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.520]  racist than that and of course we have many comments from them on end game we played some of that
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.760]  last night on the nightly news part of that documentary that alex did i think it was seven
[43:02.760 --> 43:08.120]  years ago uh where they were making blatantly racist statements they called their organization the
[43:08.120 --> 43:13.640]  race i don't know how you get any more racist than that exactly you know the people that i
[43:13.640 --> 43:18.680]  encountered last night on the anti-immigration side were very welcoming and you know they were
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.800]  pretty much peaceful they just didn't want all these people being dropped off into their city
[43:23.800 --> 43:28.840]  you know because what i was told is this facility right here is really only able to process
[43:28.840 --> 43:33.160]  up to about 20 kids at a time and then they have to release them but these buses are bringing
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.720]  100 plus kids at a time so what are they going to do with all those children that's one of the
[43:37.720 --> 43:43.880]  questions and then also you have the riots in la right now going on for the pro-amnesty people
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.200]  you know they're the ones that seem more like terrorists out of this entire situation they're
[43:48.200 --> 43:51.640]  the ones talking about the hearts and minds of these kids but they're the ones that have been
[43:51.640 --> 43:55.880]  getting violent they're the ones that have been you know getting arrested as well well you know
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.200]  they like to talk about sustainability we always hear that from the left well one of the aspects
[44:00.200 --> 44:04.520]  of that is population you know nancy polosi said she would just like to take all of these children
[44:04.520 --> 44:09.160]  that she saw home with her well there's a practical reason why she can't do that there's a practical
[44:09.160 --> 44:15.240]  reason why america can't take all of the children of the world either and that's sustainability you
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.320]  just can't sustain it any more than one person could adopt 100 kids you don't have the economic
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.360]  resources for that one of the things that they're ignoring is what they're doing to collapse those
[44:24.360 --> 44:29.160]  economies in central and south america and that's the drug war that's what they're doing in those
[44:29.160 --> 44:32.840]  countries but now they're opening up the borders and the question is are they going to have some
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.240]  kind of a false flag is it going to be some kind of a suitcase nuke is it going to be a population
[44:37.240 --> 44:42.520]  bomb is it going to be a pandemic maybe it's going to be all three of those but it looks like
[44:42.520 --> 44:47.320]  they're going to try to collapse the country whether they can do it with welfare and of course the
[44:47.320 --> 44:52.600]  the right wing is also saying let's jump in there this is an existential threat we've got a general
[44:52.600 --> 44:57.320]  saying we need to send the military to the border how do you feel about that joe uh it's sending the
[44:57.320 --> 45:03.320]  military to the border i i don't think that's a good idea because all that's going to do is escalate
[45:03.320 --> 45:08.680]  everything people that you know you know americans are going to feel like they're being threatened
[45:08.680 --> 45:12.520]  you know it's going to look like martial law when something like that happens you know it's okay if
[45:12.520 --> 45:17.400]  they send a little bit of the national guard so to say to help on the uh you know the paper side
[45:17.400 --> 45:22.120]  to do things like that but really we need to get these border patrol back out there doing their job
[45:22.120 --> 45:27.640]  on the border securing because in that recent report you know we found out that a lot of people
[45:27.640 --> 45:33.000]  other than just you know central americans are coming across the border you know iranians people
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.200]  with hezbollah you know contacts things like that that's scary you know that's a huge issue we just
[45:38.200 --> 45:43.560]  have people like that able to slip through our cracks and end to the country and it is indeed a
[45:43.560 --> 45:48.200]  chance that a false flag could happen you know you said it would look a little bit like martial law
[45:48.200 --> 45:52.680]  actually that's what they've been wargaming for for quite some time if you go all the way back to
[45:52.680 --> 45:58.920]  oliver norse rex 84 uh they're talking about conditions that they could enact martial law with
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.400]  through fema and other other ways of doing that if they put enough military on the border to
[46:03.400 --> 46:10.600]  effectively seal it off it will be martial law and you know joe i'm always amazed that men in power
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.160]  will make two mistakes rather than then admit to one when they incentivize these people to come in
[46:15.160 --> 46:18.600]  when they say go ahead and come in we'll give you all the free benefits we'll give you free
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.520]  health care we'll give you everything for free they're incentivizing it and of course the u.s
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.360]  chamber of commerce and other business leaders are pushing that as well just like they pushed
[46:26.360 --> 46:31.800]  obama care when they incentivize that and then at the same time we now have some of the democrats
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.960]  as well as republicans joining with this general and saying that's right we need the military at
[46:35.960 --> 46:41.320]  the border we need to essentially create martial law that is a very worrying thing for me you know
[46:41.320 --> 46:45.960]  they could create some kind of a you know turn america into a roach motel where you you can get
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.440]  into it but you can't get out you know i don't want to get out here once they got out here and set up
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.960]  all it takes is one little incident to spark and actually you know they're permanently here
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.200]  we got tanks rolling up and down the street every day and there's curfews not only for kids like they
[46:58.200 --> 47:04.680]  have but it'll be for everyone i mean this is a huge issue right now and the obama administration
[47:04.680 --> 47:09.960]  has completely orchestrated this yes yes i and i think it we need to look at this narrative that
[47:09.960 --> 47:15.000]  they've always used of children and saying that don't worry everything is just fine we hear all
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.440]  these reports from mpr and other mainstream media that don't worry we've got children in these places
[47:20.440 --> 47:27.320]  but uh there's not really any health concerns meanwhile we see that uh ice agents are getting
[47:27.320 --> 47:32.520]  scabies and now we have reports of tuberculosis spreading at campuses this is a report from
[47:32.520 --> 47:39.640]  fox news uh ted uh todd stars and he says the that hhs thanks to the children coming across are just
[47:39.640 --> 47:44.680]  fine but he's talked to some people who say that he's got children there showing classic signs of
[47:44.680 --> 47:50.520]  tuberculosis spitting up blood constant cough and chest pain this is being reported to him by
[47:50.520 --> 47:55.240]  nurses and they said more than seven thousand children have been processed through two camps
[47:55.240 --> 47:59.720]  and of course one of these are talking about is lackland air force base in san antonio where you've
[47:59.720 --> 48:05.160]  been a couple of times to try to get reports yeah i mean that that's a huge issue i mean the fact
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.600]  that you know the cdc and people like that are ignoring a lot of these issues you know that's
[48:10.600 --> 48:15.000]  it's just mind-blowing that our country is coming into this you know i want to show you one thing
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.800]  real quick look at this over here we're right now since there's no one out here this is where the
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.640]  pro-andicea area is as you can see fox news is set up over here you know they want to they want to
[48:25.640 --> 48:30.600]  make sure that america sees the children the little the little hearts of minds and things
[48:30.600 --> 48:34.440]  like that you know that's that's the that's the whole game they're trying to play they're not
[48:34.440 --> 48:39.400]  they're not trying to get to the real issue that this is going to hurt this small town here marietta
[48:39.400 --> 48:43.800]  the good people of this town you know they're worried about going bankrupt and losing everything
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.880]  over this and they're not going to take it anymore well it's not just there we've also
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.520]  seen that for quite some time this has been bankrupting people in texas and i think that's
[48:52.520 --> 48:57.240]  part of the problem joe people don't realize because this has been trickling for quite some time
[48:57.240 --> 49:02.760]  they don't realize that the dam is essentially bursting they've they've seen a dam that has
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.320]  developed a couple of leaks and the leaks have gotten bigger but this is a dam that is actually
[49:07.320 --> 49:11.880]  burst right now and people can't get that into their minds they don't really see the difference
[49:11.880 --> 49:15.880]  with it the only thing that the that the public is being told by the mainstream media is now that
[49:15.880 --> 49:19.960]  the only difference is we've got all these very young children coming in but that's not the case
[49:19.960 --> 49:24.120]  is it yeah i mean all they show when whenever you go to any site any mainstream site you just
[49:24.120 --> 49:28.120]  see a bunch of kids laying on the ground that that first initial process when they go through
[49:28.120 --> 49:33.320]  they don't they don't ever talk about what happens after that you know how 90 of them don't even show
[49:33.320 --> 49:37.560]  up to come to court like they're supposed to and how they're just being dropped into our country
[49:37.560 --> 49:42.680]  you know this is a huge issue right now i mean this is one of the biggest things going on
[49:42.680 --> 49:46.920]  right now and our president won't even come out here and talk to it you know talk to anybody
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.000]  about this and i was talking to some of the pro amnesty people last night i mean they were even
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.080]  peed off at the fact that the president wouldn't even come down here and acknowledge the situation
[49:55.080 --> 50:00.920]  whatsoever i mean he's too busy playing golf every day yeah exactly and of course he's spending
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.520]  a massive amounts and warfare trying to start wars everywhere across the world and one of the
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.840]  biggest wars that is really precipitating all this is the war on drugs have you heard anything
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.360]  from people there in terms of uh stepped up violence or or people that are coming in uh
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.800]  that are part of the drug gangs or is this facility just having children shipped in yeah they're just
[50:21.800 --> 50:25.240]  having the children shipped in i haven't heard anything about that but right now kind of as
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.640]  we're speaking it's starting to build up a lot more throughout the day i'm expecting a lot more
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.360]  people to be coming through here so we'll definitely be able to ask that question and find out well
[50:34.360 --> 50:40.360]  they're sending 140 people every 72 hours just to that one facility and we have seen the numbers
[50:40.360 --> 50:45.000]  of estimated people coming across the border double and then double again and those are just
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.720]  estimates one thursday yeah we're going to be right back stay with us we'll be right back with

[54:10.120 --> 54:16.040]  welcome back to the alex joneshow on this july 8 2014 i'm david night in austin and i'm talking to
[54:16.040 --> 54:21.720]  staff sergeant joe biggs and marietta california this is where there's been a pushback by the citizens
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.600]  of that area against the massive influx of people that are being brought in by the obama
[54:26.600 --> 54:31.560]  administration now of course the mainstream media is trying to carefully control this narrative
[54:31.560 --> 54:38.040]  to make it about compassion to make it about children and to say the day by who speaks out
[54:38.040 --> 54:44.440]  against this is against children is racist and yet many of us know that this is about a cloward
[54:44.440 --> 54:50.280]  and piven strategy to take down this country to collapse the borders to collapse the economy this
[54:50.280 --> 54:55.800]  goes back to the 1960s cloward and piven are very well known sociologists by people who
[54:55.800 --> 55:00.840]  look and study politics and of course it's not just us that's saying this we've even got congressmen
[55:00.840 --> 55:06.440]  who are pointing this out steven king out of ida iowa told world net daily if you don't see them
[55:06.440 --> 55:11.320]  bring reinforcements down there to seal the border that means that yes it is a cloward and piven
[55:11.320 --> 55:16.200]  maneuver to flood the country until we get to the point where we are an open borders country
[55:16.200 --> 55:21.560]  that welcomes every fit everybody legal and illegal that quote is in an article upon info
[55:21.560 --> 55:28.600]  wars dot com from paul joseph watson that says that obama is giving the marietta area ice agents
[55:28.600 --> 55:36.280]  that see immigration customs enforcement people a temporary paid leave he doesn't want immigration
[55:36.280 --> 55:42.440]  enforced he's sending them away so let's go home we'll continue to pay you just don't enforce the
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.720]  borders it is clear that's what's going on so info wars has sent reporters out staff sergeant
[55:47.720 --> 55:52.360]  joe biggs we're talking to in this hour we're going to also be talking to jacari jackson in
[55:52.360 --> 55:57.320]  the next hour staff sergeant joe biggs we're trying to get the information out that the
[55:57.320 --> 56:02.920]  mainstream media is not covering they're trying to make this all about the children and about racism
[56:02.920 --> 56:09.320]  aren't they yes they are once again i'm out here at the us border patrol center in marietta joe
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.960]  biggs here i just want to let you know that you know i spoke to one of the gentleman last night on
[56:13.960 --> 56:18.920]  the pro amnesty side and i asked him i was like sir i was like do you think we should have borders
[56:18.920 --> 56:25.080]  and he goes no we should have zero borders out here you know that kind of that kind of mindset
[56:25.080 --> 56:28.920]  is just mind blowing to me i don't get that at all and then i said well don't you think it's kind
[56:28.920 --> 56:33.240]  of crazy that you know there's a right way and there's a wrong way to go through this entire immigration
[56:33.240 --> 56:37.880]  process you know people join the military to get their citizenship things like that i've had friends
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.520]  die going through that process to try to become an american the right way and he said no he's like
[56:42.520 --> 56:47.320]  we don't need any kind of immigration process no naturalization just let everybody in so that's
[56:47.320 --> 56:52.200]  what the pro amnesty side's all about opening the borders taking them down and just let everybody
[56:52.200 --> 56:57.160]  roll in here you know joe they don't do that in any other country of the world they don't do that in
[56:57.160 --> 57:01.800]  mexico they don't do that honduras or guatemala they don't do that anywhere else in the world
[57:01.800 --> 57:05.640]  and for somebody to say that that's essentially like saying you know i don't think you should
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.000]  have any locks on your doors i should just be able to move into your house and you should
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.560]  have to support me that's essentially what he's saying you know you know having these fences is
[57:13.560 --> 57:18.040]  completely racist apparently you know and you know true americans are terrorists you know that's
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.560]  the country we live in nowadays david well we're going to be talking we're going to be talking
[57:21.560 --> 57:26.200]  to dr. Jerome coursey because you know quite frankly this fellow that you talked to last night
[57:26.200 --> 57:31.320]  who doesn't believe that we should have any borders he is a he's agreed with by uh general
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.160]  portray us as well as nancy polosi they have both said the same thing nancy polosi said we just
[57:37.160 --> 57:41.320]  have one large community north and south we just happen to have a border running through it but for
[57:41.320 --> 57:46.120]  her the border running between different countries makes no more difference than the borders say
[57:46.120 --> 57:52.040]  running between texas and oklahoma they want to treat it the same way because to her and to david
[57:52.040 --> 57:57.800]  portray us they believe that we are now a unified country and so we need to just bring those people
[57:57.800 --> 58:02.920]  in to essentially make that effective that's what david portray us said he said what comes after
[58:02.920 --> 58:08.520]  america well that's easy as north america we've had nafta for 20 years now we're seeing that happen
[58:08.520 --> 58:13.240]  we're seeing that as an established fact thank you staff sergeant joe biggs we're going to be back
[58:13.240 --> 58:18.840]  in the next hour with jacari jackson also in muriata california covering what is happening there
[58:18.840 --> 58:23.080]  we're going to tell you an angle of it that the mainstream media doesn't they're trying to spin
[58:23.080 --> 58:27.400]  this to make the protesters there look like they're violent and yet the people who have been arrested
[58:27.400 --> 58:33.320]  so far according to paul joseph watson's video they post it up looks like they were all pro immigration
[58:33.320 --> 58:44.040]  supporters we're going to be right back stay with us thank you for listening to gcn visit gcn live

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:21.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we've had alex on in the
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.440]  last hour talking about what is really at stake here and that is nothing less than the collapse
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.000]  of america into a north american union and of course we're going to be joined in the third hour
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.080]  by dr jerome coursey who realizes this as well unfortunately it appears that only info wars and
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.520]  world net daily have really picked up on the blatant comments from general portrays and
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:54.840]  nancy polosi essentially taking the mask off and if you're not concerned about this issue you need
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.920]  to understand that this is something they've been gaming for quite some time a collapse of the american
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.640]  economy so that out of that chaos and out of that collapse they can build their new world order this
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:11.640]  goes back this is bipartisan as well this is something that was being planned by oliver north
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.880]  under rex 84 they talked about different conditions and under which they would do this where they would
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:26.360]  bring in military law and martial law now we have the ndaa does that concern you that they've actually
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.160]  codified into law that the military can arrest people not tell anyone not give you any due process
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.680]  hold you indefinitely do whatever they wish to you that is part of the legal structure that has
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:45.560]  been set up by republicans as well as democrats now obama gets a lot of blame for the ndaa
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.640]  and he should he's been a tremendous hypocrite on this he came in told much of his base that cares
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.840]  about civil liberties that he was going to be someone who was transparent who was going to
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:00.600]  stand up for that and yet his record has been horrendous on that but he is doing exactly what
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:07.000]  was done with nafta just as general portray has pointed out 20 years ago they enacted these statues
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.720]  they essentially created nafta then but they were very wise about how they gradually rolled this out
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.240]  they didn't have the borders collapse at that point in time they didn't incentivize massive
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:24.920]  uncontrolled immigration that the country cannot support at that time no they waited a while for it
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.960]  and now they are making it a fact that's what we're going to be talking to dr. drum coursey about
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.240]  coursey about we're also going to be joined by jacari jackson and muriata california this is
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:41.400]  a place where people have stood up and said we don't like what's being done to our country
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:48.760]  isn't it interesting that an organization created out of the lies about 911 homeland security is now
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.600]  the organization that is collapsing the homeland that has essentially erased the borders of the
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:01.640]  homeland and yet still continues to harass people even to an even greater degree at the airports
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.040]  stepping up new little harassments make sure that your phones are charged because we're not going to
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.440]  let you take your phones in if they don't have a charge we're going to throw them away or confiscate
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:16.920]  them continually harassing people within the borders as they completely erase the borders
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:23.160]  same organization homeland security we're also going to be talking about some nsa issues of course
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:29.080]  because now we see that tyranny is coming out of the closet we've got the nsa essentially
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:35.240]  channeling jade edgar hoover and we're going to talk about that in historical context as well as
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.800]  what we just learned from the latest rounds of snodin leaks we're also going to talk about
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.560]  agenda 21 and how that's being rolled out in obama's new highway program of course they love
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:51.480]  to talk about sustainability how do you get sustainability with completely open borders
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:57.320]  they're not concerned about sustainability either environmental or economic they want to
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.360]  bring the country down as we pointed out earlier we've got an article up on info wars dot com
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.960]  source says that obama is giving murietta area immigration and custom enforcement employees
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:16.360]  temporary paid leave and as paul joseph wasin points out this is clowered in piven strategy
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.920]  in full swing and of course those are two sociologists who about 50 years ago said that
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:28.120]  in order to enact their socialist utopian state they needed to first collapse the u.s economy
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.960]  and the way to do that was with a massively expanding welfare state and the way that they
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:40.680]  wanted to do it was through the democrat party very clear plan we now see that being put into place
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.320]  we now see nafta being put into place the new world order is bringing this together and we're
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.240]  going to be covering this from murietta with jacari jackson and we're going to be covering it
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:56.600]  from a larger perspective with jerome coursey stay with us we'll be right back
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.480]  general what do you think about the fji saying that there's a terror alert on monday
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.680]  about a potential forthood situation the police are shoving people shoving alex shoving the crowd

[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:24.200]  and promote homeland security by sticking the hands down on the streets it's up to us to set

[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in austin we're going to be joined at the
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:30.360]  bottom of this hour with jacari jackson who is in murietta california and if you've been covering
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.240]  the implosion of our borders you know that there's something very different going on there we have
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.840]  the citizens of that area who are standing up to this they see the government standing down
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:46.760]  they see obama putting ice agents on temporary paid leave telling them we'll continue to pay you
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.040]  just don't do anything about controlling immigration they don't want it to be controlled and many
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:58.280]  people are asking this is a story on info wars.com from michael schneider why is obama encouraging
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:03.080]  illegal immigration when we can't take care of millions of our own citizens in particular
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.880]  the va situation we've got 57 000 veterans still waiting for their first appointment according
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.920]  to the daily caller we've got in just one va alone in phoenix we've got 1400 to 1600 people
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.960]  put on an imaginary waiting list a waiting list that they were not going to get seen they were
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.360]  lied to they were told that they were going to get something and they didn't get it that should be a
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:30.920]  warning for the people who are coming into this country that should be a warning for all americans
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.720]  how government is lying to us but of course we've sent our info wars crew out there because
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:40.280]  the way the mainstream media is covering these protests out there and essentially what they're
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:48.760]  trying to do is make the pro illegal immigration protesters they're ignoring what these agitators
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.600]  are doing and paul joseph watson put up a story yesterday that essentially showed a video that
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.720]  looked like the people that were being arrested were all pro illegal immigration supporters who
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:05.720]  identified themselves as anarcho communists but the media has portrayed this as if it is the
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:11.560]  citizens who are protesting what is being done and of course it is a cloward and piven strategy
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:18.680]  the white house is asking for another 3.8 billion dollars just to maintain this emergency situation
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:25.240]  that they have created they always use the crisis and as nancy polosi said we should view this as
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.000]  an opportunity and she certainly does she uses everything that they manufacture as an opportunity
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.600]  to make the government bigger but let's just take a look at what's going on in california
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:41.480]  we've got long wait times in california as emergency rooms blaming this on obama care and yet
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:47.800]  what will happen when we import uncontrolled numbers of people into this country that don't
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:53.880]  have any means to to provide for themselves many of these people unaccompanied minors well there's
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.240]  already tuberculosis spreading at the camps this is being reported by fox news they say that although
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.920]  a rosy picture is being portrayed by npr by most of the mainstream media even by the department of
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:10.360]  health and human services the people that they have talked to at the camps people who are nurses
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.480]  say that there are many children who are showing classic tuberculosis symptoms spinning up blood
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:22.760]  a constant cough and chest pain what is going to happen as these people come onto the roles of the
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.600]  unsustainable welfare state that that is being created in this country and of course this is all
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.280]  about the dreams of the children as obama likes to put it you know we had an american dream once
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:41.080]  what was that dream that was a dream to own your own home the federal government incentivized that
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:48.120]  dream they gave people tax credits so that they would go into debt to get a mortgage on their
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.480]  homes how did that work out for americans how did that work out that american dream when we all got
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.080]  into debt with the bankers and then we go through a pump and dump strategy many many thousands of
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.440]  people tens of thousands of people have lost their homes many more will continue to do so
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:10.120]  but of course the banks were made whole the banks came out smelling like a rose their losses were
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.840]  recouped they said that they needed it because they didn't want massive unrest they needed to
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.320]  be paid off with the tarp program or there was going to be riots in the street and yet
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:25.400]  they didn't help anybody with these mortgages they kept all the money themselves now we've got the
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:33.000]  dream act and we should think about how he pumped and dumped properties and think about the massive
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.360]  number of people that are being commented that are coming in this is a pump and dump of people
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.080]  essentially and again it's cloward and piven strategy but there's something else going on here too
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:49.800]  and that is reckless endangerment of children so many people want to say you just need to back off
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:55.240]  in dallas the mainstream media there in terms of reporting what was going to be happening as
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.280]  people were being brought into dallas area we had a judge go around the neighborhood telling people
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.800]  you can speak you can protest but you need to do it within the law well they have proscribed that
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:11.880]  so tightly in dallas that there is no free speech no protest there we've seen that with the george
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:17.480]  bush library we've seen that when info wars and alex jones went to dallas around the jfk 50th
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.560]  anniversary celebration they don't like protests they don't like the first amendment frankly and
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:30.840]  when a judge goes around door to door telling people don't exercise your free speech essentially
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.600]  if you do so you have to do it within the law well you know the first amendment says congress
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:41.080]  shall make no law there shouldn't be any laws on our fundamental rights to protest to address our
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:46.680]  grievances to the government and we have a very real grievance when we are being treated like
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.960]  slaves in this country as the borders are being opened up and we're opening our wallets or we
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.400]  should say our debt to anyone who wants to come into this country but as they were reporting on
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.560]  that they had a quote from someone there who says hey your grown-ups don't protest kids
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.360]  this isn't simply about the children of course the thing that initiated this was obama's dream
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:16.040]  act that was two years ago and that was being portrayed as they were going to help the children
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.480]  who were already here but now the message has gone out that this is proactive for anyone who
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.840]  wants to come into the into the country now or in the future they will get these benefits
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:33.320]  and it's not just for children it's for those up to the age of 31 but there are a tremendous
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.080]  number of children who are coming in what is happening to those children you know we just
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:43.720]  had a story that came out of georgia where a child died in a hot car he was locked up in a hot car
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:50.760]  got up to 88 degrees maybe to the low 90s this child died they're bringing murder charges against
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:58.280]  the parents why do we do that why do we compound those types of legal actions on parents who have
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:03.080]  just lost a child well there's a good reason for that we want to make an example of them we don't
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:08.040]  want people recklessly endangering children we want to get the message out that this is not the
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.640]  way you treat children even dogs sometimes are there's criminal charges brought up when people
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:21.800]  leave their dogs and hot cars and let these dogs die yet obama is incentivizing people to send or
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.720]  to bring their children through some of the most dangerous areas in the world to come up through
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:33.240]  central and south america to run up against the drug gangs against the human trafficking gangs
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.680]  he's incentivizing that with his welfare state he's encouraging it with his laws that's what's
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:45.400]  changed it's not the economic conditions in those countries it's the incentives that obama is offering
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:51.560]  it's obama who is recklessly endangering the children look at this story that was up on
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:59.080]  drudge report today from national review online hhs will quote muzzle the media during a tour
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:05.000]  of immigrant child housing now they put out rules and uh this is in oklahoma where we've already
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.040]  seen a congressman jem brydenstein try to get in to see what's happening to the children he's
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:16.200]  concerned about their welfare and rightfully so because he knows the history of human trafficking
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.680]  he's been involved in trying to shut that down in the past he wants to know who brought these
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.960]  children who are unaccompanied minors so to speak how did they get across this continent
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.600]  where who are they being turned over to he wanted to get in and talk to them of course he was
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.880]  turned away even though he was a congressman and they're telling journalists don't talk to these
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.320]  children we're going to let you in but it's going to be a very controlled situation listen to the
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.360]  way they're going to control it they'll let military go they'll let journalists go into the military
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:51.080]  facility but only if the media promises not to record anything if they promise not to ask any
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:57.960]  questions during the tour and not talk to any of the staff members or the children now jem brydenstein
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:04.760]  said this is a violation of the first amendment it's not transparency hhs is trying to muzzle the
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:11.080]  media and hide the human tragedy that has resulted directly from the administration's failure to
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:17.800]  enforce the law it's not compassion this is a human tragedy this is a crisis that is being
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:24.120]  manufactured so that they can use it as an opportunity to grow the government while they
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.840]  collapse the economy it's all about nafta we're going to be talking to dr. Jerome coursey in
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:35.800]  the next hour about what patreus has said what polosia said that essentially america is finished
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:41.560]  this is now north america we don't have a two different countries we happen to have
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:47.080]  one community with a border that just happens to run through it but going back to this hhs situation
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:52.520]  no recording devices no questions allowed no interacting with the staff and they will take
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:59.080]  questions but only after the fact this is what we see everywhere we go now everywhere info wars
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:06.440]  reporters go we see this kind of total crackdown on information no information is allowed out and
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  it doesn't matter whether it's this immigration strategy or something else but they don't want
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.560]  to talk to anybody they don't want anybody reporting on what they are doing you know if they were
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:20.600]  really concerned about the welfare of the children they wouldn't mind if people talk to them ask them
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:26.600]  if they were doing okay doesn't this have kind of a creepy deja vu feeling about it it certainly
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:33.480]  does to me i remember when saddam hussein in that crazy pr gimmick that he had had some children
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:39.000]  sitting on his lap do you remember that remember how awkward he looked do you remember how the
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.880]  the children were kind of looking around scared to death and he's kind of laughing oh yes everything
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:50.680]  is okay that's essentially what health and human services is doing and nobody is allowed to talk
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.240]  to these children to see if they're okay to ask them questions to look into their health but we
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.560]  have reports that there are many children who are getting sick we have reports that those who
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.360]  are taking care of them are getting sick and of course they're trying to shut down what is happening
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:10.680]  in murietta and dalas trying to do that proactively at the same time we've got a general who is saying
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:16.760]  that we need to go to the borders that this is an existential threat to america this is an existential
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:21.720]  threat to america he's right about that but that is the wrong strategy to take that is something
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.560]  that the government has been planning for quite some time we covered this on the info wars nightly
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:33.640]  news last night we talked about how the end game program that homeland security had put out that was
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:39.400]  something that exactly matched the same situation they're creating right now they create a crisis
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.800]  and the left wants to address it with a welfare state they create a crisis and the right wants to
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:49.560]  address it with a warfare state we don't need martial law we need to stop the war on drugs
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.480]  that's destroying those countries and we'll bring that violence to america we're going to be right

[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in austin we're gonna be joined later in
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.880]  the show with jacari jackson who is in muriata california that's a place where there's been a
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:28.840]  lot of protests going back and forth between pro-immigration and anti-immigration forces there
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.440]  i shouldn't say anti-immigration they're not against immigration they're against illegal
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:38.840]  immigration they're against open borders they're against sending ice agents home on paid leave
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.960]  they're against spending four billion dollars to take care of children just at the border right
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.040]  now that's not talking about their education not talking about their welfare where they're going to
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:54.520]  live these unaccompanied minors that obama is encouraging parents to recklessly endanger
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.040]  sending them through this dangerous journey into america where we don't know where they're
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.240]  coming from we don't know who brought them here we don't know who they're being released to and
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:07.720]  when congressmen try to find out about it they're shut down by the federal government now there's
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.800]  a lot going on in california one of the things that's happening there of course is that an appeals
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.920]  court has just ruled that immigrant dreamers can get driver's licenses now remember that the dreamers
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:23.560]  are people that go up to 31 years of age they're given essentially amnesty and it's not just amnesty
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.120]  for people who are already here it's for anybody who comes here now or at any time in the future
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:33.880]  apparently and so they're going to give them driver's licenses just one step away from getting a voter
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:40.600]  id this is about not only collapsing america but of course rebuilding the socialist state that
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.960]  they want that's the other part of it the other part of that is to once you collapse us economically
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.560]  to make sure that they've got a massive voter block that is here in place and louis gomert from
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:57.640]  texas had this nailed here's what he had to say well i don't know it's been clear that he is about
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.760]  winning at all costs he doesn't matter what has to be he doesn't care what has to be said
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:10.200]  that he didn't care who gets hurt he didn't care what promises get broken as ed Klein revealed
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:16.280]  in his book here recently you make whatever promises you've got to but in the end that they
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:22.440]  have said they want to turn texas blue they want to turn america blue and if you bring in hundreds
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:29.640]  of thousands or millions of people and give them the ability to vote and tell them as some uh kiko
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:34.600]  can say co said he had illegals in his district that were told if you want to keep getting the
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:40.680]  victim benefits you have to go vote and uh president obama's lawyer is not going to allow them to
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:46.360]  ask for an id so go vote or you're going to lose your benefits you're getting now that that's exactly
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:50.760]  like pork barrel projects you know where that comes from of course now pork barrel projects are when
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.880]  a congressman essentially bribes people in his district by saying look at the money that i brought
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:01.880]  home well originally where that came from was the plantation slave owners would essentially put out
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:06.200]  pork barrels for their slaves to encourage them to do what they wanted now we've got essentially
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.720]  gerrymandering by illegal immigration of course they're giving them driver's licenses we see that
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.560]  in charlotte not just in california they're giving proposed city ids this is something's causing a
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.240]  lot of stir back in north carolina and in the article they point out that there's several
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.240]  california cities oakland richmond san francisco that are giving out ids to people who are here
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:33.880]  illegally also joined by washington dc and of course new york city new york city is even spending
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.280]  eight and a half million dollars in its first year and then going to take it down to over five
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:44.280]  and a half million dollars in subsequent years to provide ids to people who are here illegally
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  flaunting the rules as joe biggs pointed out he's known many people who fought and died because they
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:57.640]  wanted to get citizenship that was the condition to sit citizenship we know many people who have
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:03.080]  waited for decades to try to get in from other countries and yet we're told that we're not
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.360]  compassionate if we don't just open up the borders and let these people in that we're somehow racist
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:16.440]  well look at what jerry brown current governor of california said back in 1975 he said don't dump
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:24.040]  vietnamese refugees on california that's right he said in 75 he tried to stop planes that were
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:30.920]  carrying refugees from landing and travis air force base near sacramento and also joe biden said the
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.800]  white house has not informed congress adequately about the number of refugees of course joe biden
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.680]  was a senator at that time george mcgovern told newsweek i think the vietnamese are better off
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:48.040]  in vietnam but now governor jerry brown signs this legislation that gives drivers licenses to people
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:53.800]  who are here illegally it will be very easy to make that next step to turn them into voters
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:00.280]  just as louis gohmert said this is about turning the country blue it's about collapsing the country
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.640]  economically a population bomb is going to be just as devastating to the united states as if it
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.400]  were a suitcase nuke and of course there's always with totally open borders there's a possibility
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.360]  that you could have a suitcase nuke not only just a population bomb but you could also have a pandemic
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.160]  as we reported earlier there are now signs that many people reporting that there's tuberculosis
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.200]  among the children in these areas that they're taking care of but of course they don't want you
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:31.480]  talking to or examining the children they don't have the children's best interest at heart if
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.200]  they did they would allow people to ask them who they're being turned over to they would allow
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.760]  independent third parties to look after their health they're keeping it very secret for a reason
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:50.680]  we'll be right back with jacari jackson and jerome corcy stay with us we're on the march the empires
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:30:01.400]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network i didn't like taste dirt in it god knows what's in

[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:24.520]  substances like fluoride chlorine glyphosate and many others studies prove that these substances
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:29.960]  are linked to an assortment of major health issues including tooth decay lower niq and even cancer
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.760]  it tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water the probe your g2.0

[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:23.960]  in austin i'm going to be joined in the next hour with jacari jackson who's in marietta california
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:29.400]  at the site of these protests against the collapsed borders that are happening there and of course
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:36.040]  it just broken the news today that obama is giving paid leave to the ice agents in that area told him
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:41.960]  just go away we'll keep paying you just don't do anything if that isn't clear that this is about a
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.040]  planned take down of the borders i don't know what is but we're going to have updates on what's
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:51.640]  going on there as they talk to people in the area and i guess we kind of need to ask ourselves
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:57.480]  why is it that the mass of the population is not really catching on what's going on
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.440]  what we have going on here is we've got a collapse at the border it'll be an economic collapse
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:09.640]  we also have a plan to make the country essentially blue they want to bring in people that they can
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.400]  rebuild their social estate with so that's the other aspect of it but then there's a third
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.800]  aspect of it and that's who we're going to be talking to in the next hour as well dr drome
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:24.600]  corsie uh both he and i have talked about how patreus and polosi have said this is part of nafta
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.840]  that nafta was passed 20 years ago as bolos as patreus pointed out and now it is going to be made
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.680]  an accomplished fact the north american union is what comes after north america when he made
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.560]  that statement when that was part of the question that was coming up on the discussion panel as a
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:47.720]  uk paper was live blogging it the guy said the question is what comes after american he goes i
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.640]  didn't really know america is dead that's right most americans don't know that either because
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.200]  they're not paying attention there's an article that came up yesterday or steve Watson on info
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:02.840]  wars a study says that people would rather electrocute themselves than think for 15 minutes alone
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:10.200]  15 minutes without some kind of stimulus without watching moving pictures on television without
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.400]  listening to something was driving them to such a state of distraction that they would rather
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.840]  shock themselves and it was a significant shock when they applied this to the people initially
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.520]  it was unpleasant enough that they said they would pay five dollars not to have it happen again and
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:33.480]  yet many of those people did it to themselves because they could not stand to be alone with
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:39.240]  their thoughts to think about what's going on in their lives in their family in their country
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:44.760]  whatever that i think is really the problem that is at the bottom of this we're going to take your

[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:01.560]  forward slash alex before i go to your calls on immigration i wanted to cover one other thing
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:07.320]  that's come out in the last couple of days because the surveillance state the ever present
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:12.440]  surveillance state is one of the things that puts us in ever present danger and of course as we
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:18.440]  reflect on the fact that they passed NAFTA 20 years ago but they let it just simmer there
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:24.600]  simmer in people's minds before they made it an accomplished fact we should be very very concerned
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:30.520]  about what's going on with the NSA this is something that's been going on for quite a long time alex
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.760]  has been talking to people about this for quite a long time but now we see a lot of information
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:41.800]  coming out about it is this really preparing people for the coming crackdown are we going to see
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:47.800]  something analogous to what's happening with the border collapse with the establishment of NAFTA
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.160]  as a fact are we going to see that they're going to use this in new and novel ways oh of course
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:59.160]  we've already had the NDA pass we've already had them say that they believe that the entire world
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.920]  including america is at a state of war and so the u.s. military can drag anybody off the street
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:12.280]  without telling anyone they can hold you indefinitely no trial no due process and no information
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.560]  about where you went essentially like argentina do you remember the disappeared in argentina do you
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:22.920]  remember that military junta there they just pick people up and they just disappeared women were
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:28.280]  showing up to protest and tears about where their husbands were where their sons were and of course
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.080]  later they found out they were just putting them in helicopters and flying them out over the ocean
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:38.360]  and shoving them out of the helicopters this is something we need to always be concerned about but
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:44.200]  look at the latest revelation from the nsa of course they this is an article that came up yesterday
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:50.200]  what your startlingly intimate voyeuristic nsa file looks like a few days ago we asked a simple
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:54.280]  rhetorical question are you being targeted by the nsa well let's take a look at some of the
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:59.720]  information that they're collecting on people according to the washington post files on intercepted
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:06.120]  americans have a startlingly intimate even voyeuristic quality they tell stories of love and
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:13.160]  heartbreak of illicit sexual liaisons of mental health crises of political and religious conversions
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:18.280]  financial anxieties disappointed hopes listen to some of the voyeuristic stuff that they're
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.640]  collecting they get resumes from job hunters academic transcripts of school children you
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:29.640]  have a young girl in a religious dress in front of a mosque or story scores of pictures that show
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.600]  infants and toddlers and bathtubs are on swings sprawled on their backs being kissed by their
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:39.480]  mothers and some photos men show off their physiques and others women model lingerie
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:45.720]  leaning suggestively into the web camera or risking or posing risque poses and shorts and
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:53.800]  bikini tops this is what the nsa is collecting it's not your metadata it's not your pen data
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:59.800]  they're collecting everything and of course what are they doing with that are they blackmailing
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:05.160]  powerful men are they blackmailing supreme court justices and others you know there was a story
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:13.800]  a few years ago about jagger hoover on the guardian as the movie from clenny swed came out and they
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:20.920]  had an interesting quote from harry truman he wrote about jet jagger hoover and he said we don't
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:28.760]  want gestapo or secret police the fbi is tending in that direction they're dabbling in sex life
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:35.640]  scandals and just plain blackmail jagger hoover would give his right eye to take over and all
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:42.840]  congressmen and senators are afraid of him and i would add presidents as well obviously truman
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:48.360]  was afraid of him as well when we look at this we need to understand with these nsa leaks we need
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:54.280]  to understand the power that the nsa has we need to understand how that kind of power has corrupted
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:01.240]  men like jagger hoover or how i should say it draws men of the nature of jagger hoover into that
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:06.760]  position when that power is there you know tyranny is literally coming out of the clause that we've
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:13.640]  got the nsa now essentially channeling jagger hoover in the way that he blackmail people i think
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:20.280]  that is a large part of why the supreme court essentially reversed its trends and with a nine
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.240]  to nothing decision last week said no the police must have a search warrant in order to look at
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.200]  people's cell phones i wouldn't be surprised at all and i've said many times that i believe
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.680]  chief justice roberts was blackmailed when he wrote both sides of the obama care case when he
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:42.440]  cited in a slim five to four majority saying that yes obama care was constitutional it's not
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.600]  constitutional to mandate that kind of thing to anybody i don't care if they call it a tax or
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:53.000]  anything else they cannot mandate that you buy health care that's not constitutional they don't
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.920]  have the power under the ninth and tenth amendment says that they haven't been explicitly given powers
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.600]  then they don't have those powers and yet we see people very selectively kicking back against it we
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:09.720]  have an article up on info wars dot com today rick warren joins leaders who are seeking religious
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:18.360]  exemptions on lgbt orders that's right freedom for him freedom for me not for the essentially
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:25.640]  this is what we see over and over again people with a very narrow perspective who don't stand up
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:32.440]  for individual rights unless it affects them that's what we've seen from far too many church leaders
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:38.600]  i was looking at uh some comments the other day i don't remember it was on the website or it was
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:44.680]  on youtube and somebody said you know i'm just fine i i know jesus and i don't really worry about
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:52.200]  any of this stuff and my response to that was really really you don't worry about what's happening
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:59.160]  to anyone else you don't want to defend what's happening to your children you don't want to
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:04.840]  protect them against a burgeoning police state you don't want people spying on them you don't
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.080]  have any compassion about that sort of thing that's where the compassion needs to come from
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:14.600]  the compassion is not creating a crisis in another country and then enticing people to endanger their
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.880]  children to come into this country that's not compassion compassion is standing up for people
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.000]  in both countries and taking down the injustice that's there if that's the way you feel i really
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.640]  think you need to go back and check your religion is that really what jesus called you to i i don't
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:37.400]  really know now one piece of helpful news that we've seen come out of california we see them
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:42.760]  opening up the gates to uh driver's licenses for people who are here illegally and of course as i
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:48.440]  pointed out in the last segment uh it's a very different story from governor brown now that it
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.120]  was back in 1975 when he didn't want any vietnamese immigrants and maybe it was because those people
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.840]  tended to vote republican maybe that's what it's really about i think it is you know for the longest
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:03.640]  time they've been gerrymandering with computers picking voters here and they're jumping across
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:09.080]  rows to select the voters that they wanted in which districts now they're just going to massively
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.400]  import them so that after they collapse the economy they will have a democratic majority
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:18.200]  to do whatever they wish but there is one good of the good bit of good news that came out of
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:23.720]  california and that is the california assembly has voted unanimously to turn off resources
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:29.960]  to the nsa this is a strategy that comes from uh the tenth amendment centers put together this
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.560]  off now dot org and they point out that the california assembly public safety committee
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:41.800]  voted unanimously to approve a bipartisan bill which creates a mechanism to turn off all material
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.920]  support and assistance they call it the fourth amendment protection act and they said that it
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:53.640]  passed the state senate last month by vote of 29 to 1 that's pretty good now if it signed into law
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.280]  it would ban the state from participating in or providing material support or resources to
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.160]  any federal agent engage in the illegal and unconstitutional collection of electronic
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.440]  data or metadata without consent of any person not based on a warrant that particularly describes
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.520]  that person place or thing to be searched or sees in other words it repeats the fourth amendment
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:17.880]  but it has teeth in it it pulls off the supply to the nsa and we just had if you're watching on
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.520]  video we just had a clip up there of the protest that happened last week there you can see the balloon
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:30.920]  balloon a very encouraging aspect of that was that you had greenpeace eff as well as a tenth
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:36.440]  amendment center people coming from different perspectives and different issues understanding
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:44.360]  that if we don't have a free society then we have lost everything we have lost on all of these
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.600]  issues and of course the tenth amendment center has put out the strategy they've been trying to get
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:54.280]  people in utah to pick this up because the massive data collection center there that is in utah
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:02.440]  is using so much electricity and so much water that it's equivalent to a medium-sized city out
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:07.800]  there and that was where they first started this idea now that's been picked up by the california
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:15.320]  legislature and that's a very very positive sign so we'll see what happens with that going back to
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:21.320]  this nsa thing though there was an interesting article from connor freedersdorf who writes for
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:27.800]  the atlantic and of course he was saying that this latest snowden leak in terms of the detail
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:33.240]  at which they're keeping these pictures and records of people really should be devastating
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:39.080]  to people who are defending the nsa and one of the things that he tweeted out he said imagine
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:44.040]  that john edwards would have been elected without being caught in a fair and then told
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:52.040]  about the nsa data collection would he have crossed the nsa good question that's the danger
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:58.600]  there's a huge danger that we have in terms of our entire government being taken over
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:04.120]  just as harry truman was saying jager hoover wanted to run the entire government and you could
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:11.160]  argue that effectively he did because he had senators and congressmen and presidents who feared
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.720]  him who feared his power to destroy and of course it has now come out in later years that
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:23.560]  he used that power quite a bit and he was also incredibly racist that's also come out in the
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:28.440]  memoirs that have that have surfaced from jager hoover but the question is why do we allow that
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.240]  kind of power to be concentrated in the first place that's the real problem with the nsa when
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:39.720]  we go back and we look at people like jager hoover we have to realize that we don't just have an
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:46.280]  individual like jager hoover we have a republican as well as a democrat congress that has now on
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:53.480]  three occasions past the ndaa act they have now on three occasions said that they're not going to
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:59.560]  give americans any due process that they can be disappeared off the streets that is what is so
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.800]  concerning about this collapse of the border especially when you go back and you look at
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.920]  the documentaries that alex jones put out seven years ago about in game talking about how they
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:14.520]  were strategizing collapsing the country by collapsing the borders using that to create
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.720]  martial law and so the question is what if anything what if anything can we do about this
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:28.200]  can we even impeach obama well that appears to be what a lot of us would like to see happen but
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:34.520]  now we're getting a lot of signs from the gop that they have absolutely no intention of doing that
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:41.240]  we see an article from pat bucanon where he's talking about impeachment being a bridge too far
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:46.040]  and of course he's pushing a new book that he wrote on the nixon administration pat bucanon
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:51.800]  was part of the nixon administration and he says we need to understand that this is something we
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:58.120]  should stop we should stop all talk about impeaching obama he says bill clinton the impeachers had a
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:02.440]  solid case of perjury he said with richard nixon they had preponderance of evidence that at least
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:07.640]  for a time he had sought to obstruct justice in the investigation of the watergate break in but then
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:14.200]  he goes on and say yet there is no evidence that obama knew of the irs plot to delay and deny tax
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:22.040]  exemptions to tea party groups well that's simply not true there have been connections that are
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:28.920]  essentially circumstantial but it's not whether or not he knew that it's whether or not he covered
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.440]  it up just like nixon nixon was not impeached because he did a burglary break in he was impeached
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:41.160]  because he covered that up he was impeached because his justice department hid information
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.720]  from congress refused to turn over information to them when you do that you become an accessory to
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:54.040]  the fact but what about vengazi what about fast and furious it's not just the irs scandals the
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:50:00.760]  scope the breadth and the depth of what obama is doing is far worse than what nixon did and so it's
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:06.120]  amazing to me that he would give a pass to them and yet it's not just pat bucannon we hear this
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:11.640]  from many gop leaders we see that michael steele said i don't see a passion for impeachment quite
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:17.800]  honestly it obscures the issues that we want to talk about and he says i don't think baner or mcconnell
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:25.000]  those would be the leaders of the house and the senate minority leader of the geop want to dance on
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:32.200]  that pen people remember 1998 he said the tea party even says you have to learn a lesson from
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.720]  clinton's impeachment i think the lesson that these guys need to learn is they need to do the right
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:42.520]  thing even if they're not going to win we need to tell them that there's going to be a penalty for
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.760]  this they're going to have a price to pay but we need to push to get this done of course there's
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:51.960]  going to be people to take obama's place there's a gazillion people like obama he's just a figurehead
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:57.480]  we need to restore the rule of law we need to stand on principle and if the republican leadership
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.160]  won't do it we need different republicans we'll be right back now i'm brought to you by infidel

[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:23.640]  all welcome back to the alex jones show on this july 8th 2014 of course we've been talking about
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:27.960]  the border collapse and we're going to continue to talk about that we're also going to take your
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:31.880]  calls if you want to weigh in and give us your perspective on what's going on with that and of
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.680]  course there's many different aspects to it it's not just a border collapse what's going to follow
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:42.840]  is an economic collapse because of course this kind of massive open border immigration is not
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:48.120]  sustainable it's not sustainable economically it's not even sustainable environmentally but
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:52.200]  then what is going to take its place well we already see in california that they are
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:57.080]  giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants they are very close to giving them voter
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:02.520]  registration as a matter of fact there's been a lot of reports as louis gomert in texas said
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:07.720]  of illegal voting and elections it's very easy to do that if you've got id and of course they're
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:13.960]  going out of their way to give them id but the larger picture of this is the collapse of america
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.920]  the destruction of america as general portrays said what comes after america that's easy north
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.640]  america this has been going on he said for 20 years we've had nafta and so we're going to talk to
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.000]  dr gerome coursey in the next hour we also have the info wars team on the ground in california
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.840]  they're talking to both pro and pro illegal immigration people as well as those who want
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:40.760]  to see immigration handled in a legal and controlled manner that is not what obama wants to see
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:47.400]  obama has given ice agents a leave of absence a temporary paid leave of absence in the area
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.720]  right now where we have the info wars crew that's myriad of california where there's been a
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:57.000]  a conflict between local residents and immigration there and so he's given the immigration
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:02.520]  officers there just uh you know take a break i'll still pay you but i don't want you to do
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:07.640]  anything to patrol our borders now of course the number to call in if you want to weigh in on this
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:16.360]  we're going to be taking calls as 800 259 9231 a lot happened this last weekend we had in chicago
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:23.800]  for example 82 people shot 14 dead over the weekend starting to sound like central and south america
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:29.720]  and there's a reason for that it's not just that people possess guns it's that we have a drug war
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:35.320]  remember when you had gangs shooting each other in the street with fully automatic tommy guns
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.080]  riding on the sides of cars the original drive by shootings yeah that was during alcohol prohibition
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:46.760]  wasn't it as we've reported many times and interviewed people who are law enforcement judges
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:51.880]  prosecutors who have worked on the war on drugs this is something that is still going on in chicago
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:57.400]  as a leaps spokesman jim girak who was a prosecutor in cook county told us
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:03.080]  80 of the shootings in chicago are related to drugs and drug gangs but here's one example
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:08.360]  that came up yesterday a veteran with concealed carry permit shot back at a chicago gunman this
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:13.880]  is an article from the daily caller and of these 82 shootings two of the people that were shot
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:20.760]  were in this particular incident it was a couple of different groups and one group came out and
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.480]  a lady saw a bottle in a car and asked the other people if they would remove it an argument ensued
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:30.520]  one of the guys from the other group goes into his house comes back with a gun and shoots the lady
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:35.960]  a couple of times in the back two other people in his group pull out guns and start shooting now
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:41.480]  here's where it was different this year than it would have been last year there was a veteran
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:48.280]  with a concealed carry permit in chicago in chicago the last state to allow concealed carry
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:54.200]  permit chicago he shot back he put the guy in critical condition that started the shooting the
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:58:01.400]  other two fled and that stopped more people from getting killed that is how this is portrayed by
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:06.760]  the media however is that this is two more people who were shot without understanding that this is
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:13.320]  probably most likely gang related most of these shootings are and also ignoring the fact that
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:19.000]  guns were also used to protect lives it's just like any other technology it can be used to take
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.120]  lives it can be used to protect lives and this is something that would not have happened a year ago
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:29.800]  chicago now allows concealed carry and the veteran protected this lady as well as other people in the
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.760]  group from that person who is now charged with attempted murder we'll be right back stay with

[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:37.400]  a couple of your calls and get you to weigh in on what you think is happening with this open
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:42.840]  border situation let's go to adam in canada adam you're part of the uh north american union
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:47.640]  according to uh polosi and patrice uh how do you feel about this immigration situation
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:54.680]  uh yeah well i'm just wondering here if uh if i were decided to jump the border from the north
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:59.320]  here and i got picked up by ice would they just give me a bus ticket anywhere in the u s and uh
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:05.560]  a little summons and send me on my way i don't know uh you know if uh i don't think so i mean
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:12.440]  a few years ago when uh we had gone into canada several times on vacations and i remember we went
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:18.520]  after september 11th and the canadians were just fine with us coming across showing a driver's
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:22.840]  license and they could see that we had an american tag and everything but we didn't have passports or
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:28.280]  anything with us and i had my sons who were very young at the time and uh when we came back uh
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.680]  they were really upset almost didn't let us back in i don't think they would let us in today i don't
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.920]  think they would let you in from canada i don't think i know they wouldn't let you in at the airport
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:41.400]  because they are cracking down even harder at the airport when we came back from Copenhagen
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:46.840]  we had to go through customs we had to go through tsa twice we had to you know the usual routine
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:50.200]  that's been there for quite some time and of course that is still there they're even cracking
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:55.720]  it down with more trivia now well yeah but i mean we've got 4 000 kilometers longest unprotected
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.120]  border in the world there's a million in one place is out in Saskatchewan i could literally just
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:05.160]  walk across the farmer's field and i'm in the united states just keep walking yeah pack the cab
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:11.160]  go to the nearest town get on a greyhound bus and if i got stopped by a border patrol would they kick
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:16.600]  me back across the border arrest me deport me i bet you any money i would be back in canada within
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:21.960]  24 hours let me ask you adam you're in canada what's going on with people who are coming
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.880]  not from canada but going into canada are you guys offering the same incentives that we are
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:33.000]  because you know we've got north american union that includes uh you know people from mexico
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.400]  should be able to go into canada and live off of the welfare state in canada as well do you guys
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:43.640]  open up yeah we do have that issue you go up to almost any major city in canada now and you can go
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:49.960]  to um what we call work corners and you'll find guatemaland just stand salvedoreans mexicans
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:54.920]  that's right um you know all sorts of latin american peoples uh in vancouver now because
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:00.200]  vancouver's got the nicest climate in canada there are tons and tons and tons of illegal
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:06.680]  immigrants there just filling up the homeless shelters going on the welfare rules um and see
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:12.600]  that's that illustrates a point it's not just america it's also canada it's also european countries
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.600]  where they are bringing in massive uncontrolled immigration because that cloward and piven strategy
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:24.680]  applies everywhere this is a globalist plan to create regional consolidation to take down the
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:31.240]  economies to strengthen the government and then to collect all of those regional economies into
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:36.120]  a global government so the same thing is happening we hear throughout western europe
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:41.560]  they're bringing in uncontrolled immigration to essentially divide and conquer the population to
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:47.720]  balkanize the countries to collapse the countries from a cloward and piven strategy on welfare thank
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:56.840]  you uh adam from canada let's go to damien in indiana damien hi um i had an idea of um how can we
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:03.720]  as patriots possibly um adopt some of these children so that they don't get indoctrinated by
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:09.000]  those bringing them across the border they get indoctrinated by uh you know true patriots and
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:15.320]  freedom lovers is that a possible solution can we chip away at this problem by doing that well
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.720]  absolutely and and that's what we need to work at this is fundamentally an information war but
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:24.760]  understand that when they try to bring them in at a young age when they offer them free
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:29.480]  college educations that they don't offer to the american public they realize that they are going
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:35.000]  to be more susceptible to government propaganda to government control than the people who are here
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.200]  already that's why they want to bring them in at an early age every dictator going back to the time
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:44.600]  of plateaus republic understood give me a child when they're young and impressionable and of course
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:49.000]  their mind for life that's a large part of what government schools are about that's the purpose
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.320]  of them that's why they want to bring them in that's why they want to lavish this state education
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:57.560]  on them we'll be right back with our info wars crew live on the ground in california stay with us
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.480]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic

[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:36.840]  see as an opportunity we've got obama enticing children to be recklessly endangered by their
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:42.680]  parents who abandon them or accompany them through child trafficking through pedophile rings through
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:49.560]  human trafficking through drug cartel gangs through deserts we have congressmen who are barred from
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.880]  talking to these same children to see what the circumstances are to interview them to see how
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:59.160]  they're being treated to see where they came from where they're going to inquire about their well
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:04.040]  being we also have journalists barred from doing the same thing we have our own journalists threatened
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:09.240]  with imprisonment for taking pictures outside of a military base not inside the military base
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:15.320]  but from the outside on public land this is a story the mainstream media is not telling
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:19.720]  that's why we've sent the info wars crew out to california and we're going to be joined right now
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:25.480]  with our info wars team live on the ground what's up guys hey this is jacari jacks reporting for

[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:10.040]  navajo and a little bit of german right so you have you have a lot of things going on in your
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.520]  heritage so as a mexican american and native american you know what's your view of this
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.800]  border situation it's an orcus orchestrated crisis you know obama's doing this on purpose you know
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:25.800]  to distract from the real issues the collapsing economy and um the drug war that's failing um
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.720]  that has been failing for a very long time and i know david you have many
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:33.800]  strong opinions about the drug war as well but we'll stay on topic here so tell us uh you know
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.000]  when did you start coming out here to these type of events and you know what things have you
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.080]  personally witnessed i came the day after they turned the buses away and there's only a few
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:47.800]  patrons here at that time and um i just noticed uh the news wasn't reporting very fairly for our side
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:51.880]  you know i interviewed with la times and they cut me out you know completely because they don't
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:56.040]  want to hear what i had to say because it's not a racial issue and they didn't like that agenda
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:01.640]  they have a they have their own agenda to push and they don't like me as far as the mainstream
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:05.080]  media you said the la times was out here have you personally witnessed any other people we see
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:10.360]  fox news out there right now have you seen any any other uh mainstream outlets um cnn was here
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:14.840]  they were only covering they weren't covering really our side they were covering um there was
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.800]  a girl here protesting us saying that we're on stolen land and then when i proceeded to tell
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:27.240]  or that you know but i'm we're starting to lose transmission there she just ignore me you know
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:32.280]  okay we gotta back her she was fake crying okay sorry well we're starting to lose our connection
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:37.480]  there but uh we started lose connection the jacari i think we've got you back now though
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:43.560]  i wanted to ask him about how this was spun the other day of course it was implied by the media
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:47.800]  that the violence that was there that the people that were there that got arrested
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:54.520]  that they were protesting the uh open borders but from the video that we saw that paul joseph
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.600]  watson put up yesterday on info wars dot com in an article it appeared that the people that got
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:05.000]  arrested were those who were supporting illegal immigration and open borders uh is is that what
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.400]  he saw there what mr garza saw there yes that's exactly what happened what happened was there
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:13.960]  was a lady here on our side the patriot side who was hispanic but you won't hear that in the media
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:19.480]  and these all um la rosa people came and attacked her physically and the cops had her arrest them
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.560]  what type of you know you'd say they attacked her physically what do they do they like slapped
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:28.040]  her hand because they try to come up close to her and take pictures and she slapped you know she
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:32.840]  tried to move to move them away and they pushed her you know you talk about the kkk that's something
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.840]  we saw back in the civil rights movement some of the people who got the most severe beatings
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:43.000]  were the white people that were marching in civil rights because they drew the ire of the kkk
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:47.720]  more so even than the black people so i'm not surprised that they would that the rosa would
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.680]  single out an hispanic lady and attack her of course they always seems like uh when they operate
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:58.360]  as gangs uh whether it's uh gangs of uh blm agents in nevada or whatever they seem like they always
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:04.200]  pick out the females or the weakest uh people in the group to pick on them that's exactly right
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:08.840]  davin and i will say for these uh federal agents you know i know you and i as well see other info
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:13.640]  wars crew members we often come in contact with the uh so-called authorities but the people out
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.640]  here they've been uh very polite and friendly at least the people we personally uh talked to we
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:21.880]  haven't had any issues with the board patrol or any other people so i will give them that uh for
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:25.720]  this issue but we don't want to forget that the board patrol that these ice agents are being
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:30.680]  told to stand down you know going to furlough you know take a week off vacation don't monitor
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:34.680]  these uh these stations don't monitor these processing checkpoints and all these other things
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:38.280]  just let the people come on through and then we'll deal with them once they get here and that's the
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:41.800]  thing that you always keep hearing david that's like well since they're here now we have to deal
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:45.560]  with them as i well why don't we try to put something in place so they necessarily cannot
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:50.040]  get here the illegal way of course we want people to be able to come to this country legally and i'm
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:55.000]  sure mr garza does as well but you know we have to have the right things in place the right system
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.560]  in place so mr garza can you tell us so you know to anybody out there who may be from these central
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:03.000]  american countries or any other country for that matter there are many other people coming through
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.080]  these border checkpoints what would you say to them if they want to come to this country you know
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.720]  there's right channels to do it and the way that coming is dangerous you know you're going to face
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.360]  a lot of like bad people coming through here through mexico and central america and they're
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.680]  going to take advantage of you they're going to abuse you yeah we've seen the stories about the
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.440]  the young ladies coming through sometimes the ladies are the young ladies are traveling alone
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:28.600]  they get raped uh they get exploited by the coyotes coyotes take their money and just drop them off
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:33.160]  someplace so they are very real travel concerns yeah it's not worth the risk to your life you know
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:38.280]  and um the problem is the administration is encouraging this and the people don't even realize
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:43.560]  how dangerous it really is you know and yeah because they want to talk about issues that are
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:46.920]  very relevant they talk about the health concerns they talk about how some of these guys come in
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:50.200]  they're gang affiliated those are very real concerns but something that everybody can
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:54.040]  understand is the bottom line the bottom dollar how much is this going to cost and you know who's
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.960]  going to pay for this you know obama is not taking this money out of his personal bank account
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:03.000]  to bring these people here so it's the people of san pedino california back in 2009 they had to pay
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.720]  60 about 60 million dollars for welfare benefits for these illegal immigrants and how much more
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:11.400]  the people here in murietta that's what all the people are telling us they say you know i have
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:15.480]  no problem with these people coming here i i just can't afford it i have two kids in my house already
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:19.720]  i can't afford a third especially when it's not my own you know i do you do you find uh people
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:23.720]  say those similar sentiments yeah myself included you know i'm looking for a second job right now
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:27.960]  because i have a child on the way and we can't make it you know my house is under water we have
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:34.040]  troubles here you know help us you know they're not going to help us no they don't want to help you
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:39.080]  they want to they want to say that you're racist or you're a you know whatever term they use now
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:43.240]  they don't want to talk about the real uh severe issues that's going to have on you and then you
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:47.800]  know okay so when america brings all these people in that it can't afford because we obviously don't
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:52.680]  take care of our people right now so when we start to look like an l salvo door whatever else
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:55.640]  and then it's gonna like everybody wants to go to kanda everybody wants to go to switzerland
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.760]  and then it's like oh you're racist because you want to allow all these people in well that's what
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.000]  they want they want to collapse they want us all equally poor i mean that's that's their plan that's
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:09.960]  been their plan you know let me ask you mr. garza about muriela how far from the border are you
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:14.520]  and how are they bringing these people in and how would you characterize the the people that are
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:18.200]  being brought in are they mostly children or are they young adults or are they older adults
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:22.840]  you know they say they're children but i personally haven't seen any because you know
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:28.680]  they turn the buses away pretty quick um but i doubt it's just children i mean who knows they
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:35.000]  they were classifying people who were like 18 19 as children well all the way up to 31 years of all
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.960]  uh years of age they're considered to be children under the dream act so uh that includes anybody
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:44.600]  up to 31 years of age under the dream act but uh so they're being bused in from the border how
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.800]  far are you from the uh mexican border i think we're about like maybe 80 80 miles 100 miles
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:55.320]  yeah we're kind of far i mean it's not that close okay so you're within that 100 mile
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:02.680]  constitution free zone yeah so do you get hassled uh in ordinarily by uh ice agency they set up
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:09.160]  checkpoints to ask people what country they're from there was a checkpoint on the 15 um coming north
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.200]  but i i don't know if it's an operation right now because of the funding but they have before
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:18.360]  they took me out of the car and they asked to search the car and this was when i was like 16 so i
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:22.920]  didn't you know i didn't know my rights back then so i got taken advantage of yeah and that's what
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.760]  they'll do david because people need to realize just because you get a pass from the border patrol
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:31.960]  does not make you a us citizen at any time a proactive ice agent come knocking your door hey sir
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.240]  you need to come with me well the border patrol said i could stay here well that was the border
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:39.400]  patrol i'm ice you're going to the uh to the immigration hearing so i mean it's something
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.640]  that's very relevant relevant that people need to understand and they always parade out the kids
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.400]  it's all for the kids it's all this it's all that you know we want the kids to have you know good
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:51.960]  schools and good uh healthcare and all these other things but you can't forget about the kids here
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:55.960]  you know we have uh failing test grades here in the united states you know we can't educate the
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:00.440]  kids that are already here how much more we have to split our resources to try to teach these
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.480]  classes in spanish for some some other dialect oh absolutely and Pelosi said she wanted to bring
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:10.520]  all the children home with her but of course she took zero yeah me and me and uh staff sergeant
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:14.840]  joe biggs she's like i want to take all the kids i was like well i didn't see any kids that's right
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.880]  armored compounding on more than that we do have joe biggs standing by i think he's he's ready to
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.920]  get in here but mr. guards i just want you to give us any of your final thoughts you know people wake up
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:30.120]  you know both sides are exploiting this issue the republicans and the democrats um there are two
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:35.640]  sides are two different sides of the same coin you know they both have agendas um that's why i say
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:40.760]  seek alternative people outsiders you know like a ted cruise ram fall ram fall you know because
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:44.440]  the establishment's not going to help us they're not here to help us well hang on we're getting

[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:46.920]  fact that the border has been opened up and essentially collapsed in the last segment we
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:52.920]  had jacari jackson talking to a mr. garza of hispanic origin there and he was talking about how
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:58.840]  la raza far from trying to be embracing you know we we hear that if you oppose the open borders
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:04.040]  that you're somehow racist and yet he said he heard they were acting essentially as an hispanic
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.800]  kkk let's go back to our info wars crew live on the ground in california all right i'm staff
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:15.560]  sergeant joe biggs here live and marietta california at the epic shutdown of the border
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:21.000]  uh i just spoke to a uh true patriot over here and he told me something i found very interesting
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:26.360]  he said we are importing poverty i like that i like to have said that i thought that was a
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  a very interesting quote you know there's a lot of people starting to show up out here right now a
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:37.160]  lot of people are very passionate about this the town of marietta the people here are true americans
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:41.240]  you know to be able to come out here and stand up and say no we're not dealing with this anymore
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:47.240]  you know you're not only importing poverty but you're also importing voters as well they've given
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:51.960]  them in california they've just said they're going to give license driver's licenses to
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.040]  illegal immigrants uh they're going to issue them driver's licenses and of course we know that
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:00.920]  there's been a lot of voter fraud in a lot of different areas using illegal immigrants it's
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:07.080]  going to be very easy for them to uh get a uh driver get a voter registration if they're
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.840]  going to give them driver's licenses and we've already had a lot of jurisdictions say that they
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:18.520]  want illegals to vote and part of that i think uh joe is that this is all about the north american
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.280]  union and in the next segment we're going to be talking to dr gerome coursey we're going to break
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:27.080]  that down in more detail for people but of course nancy plosie doesn't really see the difference
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:31.240]  between people that are coming from what we would perceive as being different countries
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.640]  she says we have just one community but it happens to have a border running through it she doesn't
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:41.480]  see that as as any more consequential than the border between texas and oklahoma for example well
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.320]  one of the gentlemen i spoke to earlier he was saying that you know one of these kids from central
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:51.400]  america at the age of 15 could break down an ak-47 blindfold because they've been growing up in a
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:56.680]  world of war basically non-stop you know with poverty and a lot of battle going on between
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:02.280]  the people so to say that this is some new crisis down there is just complete and total you know
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:06.440]  lies you know they've been dealing with this stuff forever so when these guys come over we don't know
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:11.240]  who they are you know they have ptsd in a sense they're young impressionable minds that can be
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:16.040]  altered and brainwashed and like you said those will turn into votes and then next thing you know
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:21.800]  they take our guns away and things like that it's a scary situation out here it's much easier to
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:26.280]  take young people i think that's why they're focused on this at this point they created the dream
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:31.960]  act two years ago they made it very clear however just recently that it wasn't going to merely apply
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.320]  to people who are already here they were using it to bring people here now and in the future
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:42.680]  and obama is essentially incentivizing this kind of immigration he's enticing people
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:46.520]  to put their children in danger mr garza that we were just talking to there
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.280]  and muriela knows that area very well he knows the dangers that people are going through
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:56.840]  we prosecute parents who leave their children locked up in a hot car during the summer why is
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:02.200]  it that our administration is incentivizing people to either do that to their children
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:08.040]  and expose them to the dangers of drug cartels as well as human trafficking as well as the
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:13.880]  dangers of the desert why are we incentivizing that instead of discouraging that i mean exactly
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:18.040]  the only way that these kids can make it from central america through mexico is through these
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:23.400]  cartels that's the only way they get passage i mean there's nothing safe about it whatsoever
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:28.040]  i mean your parent sending your child off with the drug cartels and hopes that they'll make it
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:34.200]  out there i mean who does that yeah and of course as we've seen they they haven't been able to uh
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:40.040]  the residents have prevented anybody from getting into that facility so far but in other areas where
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.440]  they have brought in people into the facilities we've seen a congressman in oklahoma who wanted
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:49.480]  to go in and inquire about the safety and the well-being of the children he was told he was
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:54.840]  not going to be allowed to do that hhs is now saying that reporters not going to be able to
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:59.080]  video record any of these children they're not going to be able to talk to them they can't even
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:04.520]  ask questions until after the event they can then submit questions what kind of have you had any
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:09.480]  interactions so far there in muriata california with any of the immigration officials or the
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:14.680]  border patrol people no they're pretty much staying right over there at the very entrance to the
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:20.360]  border patrol area with the pro-amnesty people that's where main star lamestream media is posted
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:25.320]  up right now you know none of them have been down this way some cops have driven by but the cops
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:29.800]  have driven by and some of the border patrol from what i've heard over the past few days they wave at
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:34.040]  everybody on this side i think they're a little bit more on the side because the people in muriata
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:39.480]  like i said are standing together as one for this the people who are the pro-amnesty we're coming
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:44.040]  up to our break so we're coming up to a break thanks so much we're going to be having more reports

[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:50.360]  wars store.com now we've been talking this whole program about the collapse of the border because
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:57.560]  the collapse of the border is not simply about that it's about the collapse of america it's
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:03.960]  a cloward and piven strategy to collapse the economy to accelerate and expand the welfare
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:09.800]  state so quickly that the country cannot afford it and it will collapse the country that's also
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:15.560]  what obama care is about it's a cloward and piven strategy and they are putting it on with
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:21.320]  steroids right now but there's also a question of what do they do after they collapse america
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:28.200]  well that question was asked at a seminar a couple weeks ago in london and david patreus was the one
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:34.120]  who was chosen to give the answer and he said well what comes after america what comes after the
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:39.960]  collapse of america that says well he says that's easy north america and he goes on to say that for
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:45.800]  20 years now we've had the north american free trade agreement and what is happening now that
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:52.760]  we see in america is that being made an established fact if they had done it right away when they pass
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:58.600]  the legislation people would have realized what's going on but people don't realize it when it happens
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:06.040]  to them very slowly we had polosi go last saturday to the border and make it very clear that she
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.880]  didn't see a couple of different countries she just saw one community north and south
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:16.680]  and it just happened to have a border running through it let's play those quotes and i want
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:22.360]  to get dr drum coursey to comment on that here's polosi and patreus in the middle anyone who comes
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:30.040]  here sees that this is a community with a border going through it boldly proclaimed the coming
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:37.160]  north american decades as the title now it's founded on recognition that if you put these three
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:42.920]  economies together as has been the case 20 years into the north american free trade act implementation
[02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:51.880]  uh you find unique uh countries in terms of demographics we're all americans in this hemisphere
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:59.080]  north and south america and this crisis that some call a crisis we have to view as an opportunity
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:07.720]  there we go this is not a crisis but it's an opportunity to essentially make nafta and established
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:14.920]  fact dr drum coursey joins us from wnd dr coursey what do you make of what you just heard well i
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:22.680]  reported on both in wnd and i've been writing about this now going back to about 2005 uh that
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:30.920]  there is a move on the left globalist move to create a north american union and uh we saw it even
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:35.880]  under president bush with the security and prosperity partnership in north america these
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:43.880]  themes don't stop and the key to getting this to succeed there's two keys one is it has to be a
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:50.040]  stealth methodology in other words uh the globalists and the politicians like president obama advancing
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:57.880]  this agenda have to be able to deny they're doing it and secondly it has to be done in a gradual enough
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:06.440]  way so that people don't catch on or so the next step seems natural or logical i mean you know 20
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:11.800]  years ago if you'd had this influx of kids across the border and they're not kids coming across the
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:18.520]  border these are predominantly teenagers a great number of them are gang members uh drug cartel
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:25.880]  dealers uh mixed in with criminals terrorists i mean we're doing no background checks we're doing
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:35.240]  no health checks and it's not a refugee problem this is a created crisis to flood the border
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:43.160]  with children maybe 200 000 of them because um the play of the globalists the democratic
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:49.240]  left are making is that americans will be too soft-hearted we won't want to you know send these
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:56.120]  kids back home yeah and the process what we do is we blur the border 20 years ago it wouldn't have
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:02.280]  been tolerated but today i'm sure this was just a very very i think it's a situation where the
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:07.320]  essentially looks like they're taking the mask off and that's what i find very troubling we're
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:12.440]  seeing that they're accelerating this expansion of the welfare state at the same time that they're
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:18.360]  essentially doing a bit of a reveal here i thought it was pretty astounding to hear the comments of
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:24.440]  both Pelosi and patrice to say that uh you know that this is about the north american union we
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:30.600]  of course have had it for 20 years and uh now we see that we have some unique demographics as the
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:35.320]  kind of euphonisms that patrice had i also thought it was interesting that this was done at the
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:41.320]  margaret thatcher conference on liberty i mean here's somebody who went to bill de berg and went
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:46.040]  you know toe to toe with these people and was driven out because she didn't like the european union
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:50.280]  and of course the european union is just a different part of the strategy for the north american
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:55.000]  union they want to consolidate everything after they get these regional uh consolidations well
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.880]  see george bush i mean here's what i'm talking about george bush went down to the border uh
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:07.000]  in you know to declare 2005 the security and prosperity partnership and had these spp meetings
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.120]  with the head of mexico and the head of canada and so just having the three of them together
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:20.440]  they're on the stage the flags all together presents to you know visual image subliminally
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:25.800]  that this is north america now of course we beat that back i wrote a book called the lake great
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:34.520]  usa uh alex jones fought it very hard as did wnd making this agenda obvious to our readers and to
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.640]  people listening to your radio show that in fact this was a conscious effort just like
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:47.000]  the european union had been created as a socialist communist methodology you know we don't need borders
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:55.160]  we really are all one entity and creating these regional groups north america you know then trade
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:41:01.400]  groups has always been the methodology we do a nafta and then so that's just for trade but
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:08.840]  ultimately it brings within a whole political structure to make the trade work and to resolve
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:14.040]  disputes and trade and dr coursey you know as we're talking about the nafta and and they see
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:18.440]  this as an accomplished fact i i think that explains why when you're talking about george
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.440]  bush being down there that you covered it with the flags everything i think that's why the gop
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:26.920]  is not only been silent about this but essentially complicit in it you know they're talking about well
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:32.440]  this is we've heard this uh from them as well saying this is an opportunity for us to do immigration
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:37.640]  reform but you're talking about how they bring this in with the trade agreements we now see that
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:44.040]  they're moving beyond the step of consolidating regions like north america and europe they're now
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:50.920]  moving to join those areas into a world government with a secretive trade agreement the transatlantic
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.120]  partnership we also see the trans-pacific partnership those are being negotiated in complete
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.720]  secrecy without any input or oversight from any the public and certainly not even from our elected
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.600]  representatives i've been writing about those for two years warning people that are coming
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:13.000]  yes oh what you have is um congress not giving fast track authority which would have
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.760]  you've been designed to rubber stamp the trans-pacific partnership which is the one
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:24.120]  they wanted the obama administration wanted to do first but see the the globalists don't mind
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:29.720]  because they've and they've had the first salvo they put in people's minds that this is coming
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:35.160]  even if they don't win this round when they come back the next time it's going to seem like oh well
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:43.320]  we've heard this before and the desensitizing of americans to the fact that we are north america
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:49.480]  that you know there is no border that we can let these people trans migrate at will but
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:55.480]  uh you know the the whole idea the republicans think we get cheap labor with the migrants coming
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:02.440]  in and the democrats think we get a generation of new hispanic democratic voters and the democrats
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:09.240]  are going after a permanent presidential majority for the future with african americans hispanic
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:14.440]  single women they're playing identity politics they're playing interest group politics they're
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:22.440]  promising everybody um obama phones and food stamps and dream act and you name the promises the
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:28.440]  communists always the socialists always come on promising utopia what you get at the end is
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:33.720]  slavery what you get at the end is the loss of rights the loss of nation we just take a look
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:40.840]  at where the country is we're moving into part-time employment as i've said going back to the world
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:47.560]  trade organization the the globalists have put the jobs in china a massive numbers of americans
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:53.640]  have been unemployed are especially especially among our youth we're supposed to embrace the uh
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:59.000]  youth of other countries with this dream act and yet it's american youth who have such amazingly
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.160]  high unemployment and of course they're not going to be given college educations unless they become
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:08.600]  indentured servants but immigrants from other countries who come here illegally can get in
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.400]  state tuition at any state that they want to go to and many times to get a free ride going through
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.560]  there but i i guess i think the most important thing that we could get across the people dr
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:24.120]  coursey is to get them to not look at this as something that is simply obama but this is something
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.440]  as you point out it's been going on for decades going back to the beginning of the north american
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:34.600]  union and it's not a matter of incompetence either because this is a plan many people don't
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:39.240]  understand that it's about america being taken down they just look at it and they say well we're
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:43.480]  making a mistake or it's incompetent or obama doesn't know what he's doing but it's none of those
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:49.320]  things this is a deliberate plan and we can't even get people to understand what they see
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:53.320]  as being completed and that's the north american union while they're working on the very next stage
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:58.440]  they're laying the groundwork and establishing the legislative uh agreements to establish the
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:05.320]  next stage of consolidation between these different uh economic areas well and that's the the logic
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:11.560]  of the of the collared piven socialist argument is that you know you you say okay well we don't want
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:18.440]  to disadvantage these children coming across the border or certainly we care about poverty and
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:23.880]  you know clearly the workers around the world we want to help the world develop so using good
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:32.280]  you know normal human emotions these agreements are put into place which are completely at odds
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:38.120]  which will destroy the system the architects like john monay who designed the european union
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:44.200]  socialist you know background uh they all said well if we could just have a united europe we
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:50.120]  wouldn't have a world war three world war one was the rise of germany you know against england and
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:55.240]  france world war two was a repeat we don't want germany rising against so we'll create a north
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:46:01.880]  america we'll create a european union well that was a lie that whole thing was a lie it was designed
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:09.160]  from the beginning to make europeans be one governments and the government is in brussels
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:15.880]  and luxenberg you get unappointed you know un un representative not elected bureaucrats and
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:22.040]  nameless bureaucrats writing your laws producing volume after volume of rules and regulations
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:26.920]  that you have to obey and pretty soon you've lost your freedom that's the goal from the beginning
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:33.560]  and to wake people off to see that they're being led along this path step by step as the cloward
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:39.560]  piven is a lying strategy and it's a progressive strategy it's put into place a little bit at a
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:46.680]  time always previewing a little bit ahead but assuming even when you've lost even when you
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:51.240]  know the north american union didn't get voted in even when the security and prosperity partnership
[02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:57.000]  had to be disbanded because of criticism on how president bush president obama comes in and
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.480]  presumes that north america is already going into place because the idea has already been lodged
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:07.880]  in people's minds oh yes and do you see any sign whatsoever that there's anyone in the gop that is
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:13.320]  effectively going to do anything about it i mean we see that the india act where they say the
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:17.960]  military can arrest people at will and just disappear them off the street hold them indefinitely
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:23.640]  without due process that's a bipartisan issue it appears that the certainly the gop leadership is
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:29.240]  fully on with this they call it immigration reform but we haven't seen any pushback against what obama
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:34.280]  is doing from the gop have you seen any pushback that you're aware of that significantly and look
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:40.760]  this has nothing to do with not passing immigration reform is to do with president obama refusing
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:48.280]  to obey the laws that are on the books to enforce border security exactly going back to the secure
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:54.120]  fence act which was you know duncan hunter when he was in congress pushed forward represented
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:48:01.640]  from san diego congress voted the secure fence act and then republicans like k bailey hutchinson
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:07.080]  in texas came along and stripped the law of its you know the necessity to build a fence by putting
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:13.880]  an appropriations bill for dhs the fence didn't have to be built if the local officials felt there
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:19.960]  was a better alternative to securing the border so virtually no fence got built right right you
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.640]  know what we now see that we've got an american general who's saying this is an existential
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:27.800]  threat to the united states and of course i'm sure you're aware this has been a plan for a
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:33.640]  long time to try to create a kind of martial law situation i'm very concerned about a military
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:38.360]  buildup at our border i'm even concerned about a fence i want to remove the incentives that
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:44.360]  are drawing people in but we can't even seem to do that can we well you've got to have border
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:49.480]  security you have to have a border yes and then one is this force has got to be secured me what
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:56.120]  does frighten me is the you know this creeping big brother is i mean the national security
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:03.720]  the NSA being able to monitor every phone call look at every email i'm going to monitor our
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:10.440]  discussion on skype and radio broadcast archive all this data this is the beginning of its
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:14.920]  totalitarian state it's the beginning of the state punishing people for thought crimes
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:21.400]  at the left is intolerant the left is the one who are the globalists and they're intolerant
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:27.160]  they will not don't believe in first amendment they don't believe in free speech they believe that
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:32.760]  you know you're wrong if you disagree with them you're immoral you're you're not sufficiently
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:39.720]  evolved to understand you know their their lofty moral concepts well the lofty moral
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:46.360]  concepts have been rejected by biblical principles going back 2000 years and by the american exceptionalism
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:52.760]  which even the republicans deny uh you know you've got well there's a there's a great
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:50:00.520]  deal of hypocrisy that's going on we've got joe biden and jerry brown on record back in 1975
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:05.080]  saying we can't take any more vietnamese we can't open up our borders to them why should we take
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:09.640]  care of them and these are the same people who as you pointed out earlier they're looking to
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:15.720]  create a democratic majority this is essentially gerrymandering by importation i believe and you
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:21.400]  know but part of that is of course it's a collapse the economy rebuild it with this new demographic
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:27.080]  that they're bringing in and then all of this fits into the globalist consolidation that we see going
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:32.840]  on but i want to ask you about uh let me make a point yes yes hang on we're going to come back
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:36.040]  right after the break we've got to come back i'll let you make your point and i wanted to ask you
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:42.600]  about the hypocrisy of homeland security the same agency opening up the borders completely and yet

[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:21.720]  dr jerome coursey we've just been talking about his article the astonishing statement from
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:26.520]  general patrice in london a couple of weeks ago at the thatcher conference on liberty
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:32.200]  saying what comes after america and of course his answer was a north american union and if you want
[02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:37.080]  to understand what's going on with the border collapse it's not just the collapse of the border
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:43.320]  the collapse of the economy the rebuilding into a democrat or i should say a socialist majority
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:49.000]  but it's also this consolidation and just before we went to the break we had to cut off dr coursey
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:52.920]  he wanted to make a point go ahead dr coursey what was it that you wanted to say well i want to
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:58.360]  explain that the you know this opening of the border is a conscious plan by the globalist
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:03.400]  political left in particular this time around and democrats there's a full understanding
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:09.320]  by the time we have several million children and they're not children these are teenagers many of
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:15.000]  them are criminals many are gang members many are cartel members who knows who they are we're not doing
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:21.320]  any background checks or medical checks though the next thing it'll be chain immigration the next
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:27.800]  thing that happens is they'll try to settle these children with relatives these kids will want their
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:34.360]  parents and their other relatives to come here you know the government stayed with this 13 million
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:41.960]  Hispanics immigrated into the united states and it could be 23 million it could be 33 million we don't
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:49.560]  really know and it becomes a revolving door so that pretty soon we are central america and the
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:55.480]  people who are here you know work here to the extent they can they're underclass we have to educate
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:01.080]  them they'll vote democrat they'll want all the benefits they've been promised food stamps dream
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:07.160]  act education you name it uh and then they'll go back to their countries to live in retirement with
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:13.480]  the money they've made here but at the same time they're coming with no understanding of america
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:19.160]  now of our history of our values of our constitution they're trained in a progressive sense they are
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:27.160]  socialist and the democrats are fully understanding that their goal is to create democratic voters
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:34.600]  to erase the borders and to push ahead into this global you know socialist idea of a north american
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:39.080]  union well yes and of course and they've been doubling the estimates of the number of people
[02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:43.080]  coming in just every couple of days as you're pointing out this is going to be very similar
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.400]  to the anchor babies that we've seen in the past and yet this is going to be essentially
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:52.040]  anchor teens if you will you know they're but they're not even teenagers i mean they're not
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:58.040]  necessarily young children teenagers this includes people up to the age of 31 according to the dream
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:03.400]  act and look the uh the republicans are complicit in this because the republicans are equally
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:10.200]  globalist they want the idea of free labor the republicans have been told by the establishment
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:15.960]  republican party including the mit romney's of the world that you know they'll they'll offend
[02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:21.720]  the Hispanics that they don't if they're not democrat light and go all the things the democrats
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:27.960]  want to do the republicans should be saying no look we'll have legitimate legal immigration we
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:33.560]  will have people here who we want here who contributing can work we want people who will build
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:38.680]  families who will take an oath of allegiance to the united states of america say the pledge of
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:44.440]  allegiance not be part of mexico or some other country in central america just living here and
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:52.040]  that's part of the difficulty we're not immigrating with an intent to absorb into america a new group
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:57.880]  of people these people are bringing with them central america and mexico that's why immigration needs
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:03.800]  to be controlled because there's a limit to how many people can be assimilated into into a society
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:10.600]  without balkanizing it into different groups i think this is very much obama's youth core that
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:16.280]  he's talked about is is that you take on it looks like we're it's also identity politics dividing
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:21.160]  one the other the losers here are going to be the american blacks unfortunately and that's
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:27.800]  another long story yes thank you very much dr drom coursey wnd and of course he's written on this
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:32.920]  we hope that we can get people to see the larger picture and the larger picture is not just the
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:38.200]  how cloward and piven but it's also what replaces it and of course they've already seen that is nafta

[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:29.800]  here big time carry on the middle of the back there you'll ride a skateboard down the middle
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:34.840]  of the street well tattooed up everything well of course that's what's happening in myriad of
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:39.320]  california where we have them for worst crew on the ground they're being called there that
[03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:44.280]  they're bringing people in to stage them in that area and then they're going to transport them on to
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:49.240]  their destinations or final destinations in the u.s and i guess that would be including flying them
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:53.560]  to hawai there you go that's another benefit of being an illegal immigrant you get a free
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:02:00.360]  flight to hawai let's go to uh judy in florida judy go ahead hey david it's nice to speak with you
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:07.240]  um it's really ironic you had mr. coursey on i i read his book i guess soon after it was published
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:14.280]  and uh it i almost you know lost a friend over it essentially because uh they came from the
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:19.800]  perspective that he was on the lunatic fringe of the republican party and you know i understood
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:25.800]  what the effects of nafta were i knew about the spp and and you know i could just see what could
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:32.280]  the future could look like but um i was wanted to comment on two things one was something that you
[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:39.080]  said earlier about uh the christian perspective about how you know they feel that they can just
[03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:45.160]  rely on jesus for these things and what a fallacy that is i mean i i had one gentleman a friend
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:50.520]  of mine who uh basically said well if i like die as a martyr in five or ten years you know he was
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:59.880]  at peace with that but this man has four children so it's like i i don't understand how uh he could
[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:06.760]  just dismiss what you know the whole future in regard to his christian beliefs i mean i'm
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:11.960]  about christian myself and and i agreed with what you said about you know the responsibility that we
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:17.720]  essentially have as far as you know looking after our brother as best we can i mean yeah you know
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:22.200]  that's a that's a question you know we're christians and we we see the big picture but as frances
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:27.720]  schaefer said well then how should we live and what do we do do we just uh go set on a mountain
[03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:33.320]  and contemplate our naval or do we try to help people i i don't think that you've got the right
[03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:39.160]  idea if you're just going to go sit in isolation i think that we are called to address injustice to
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:44.040]  address suffering in many ways and i think the reason i brought this up partially is because
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:49.160]  i think there are a lot of christians who have a misguided compassion about what's going on they're
[03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:55.320]  not seeing the big picture they don't realize that there are better and more secure ways to help
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:04:01.640]  people and that they're using these children as a beard for a very alternative and sinister purpose
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:06.120]  thank you so much judy let's go listen i want to try to get several callers in let's go to mike
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:15.720]  and louisiana mike hello david i have a quick question and then a comment sure go ahead uh
