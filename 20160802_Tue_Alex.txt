[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:33.000]  It's Tuesday, the second day of August 2016. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:39.000 --> 00:48.000]  If you're a lay person out there that isn't really a political insider, someone that researches how the world actually runs,
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  and you tune into mainstream media, you would think that Donald Trump is having his butt handed to him.
[00:54.000 --> 01:03.000]  But Donald Trump is making a bet that the dinosaur media is so discredited with a 6% trust rate, according to the Associated Press,
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  that you're smart enough to see through their garbage.
[01:06.000 --> 01:19.000]  And he's come out in a new speech today that's linked at DrudgeReport.com and on Infowars.com. Trump, we are going to punch through the media.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  And I'm going to play that clip in a moment.
[01:24.000 --> 01:34.000]  But that's what we've got to do. In fact, I walked in this morning and then I said, well, you notice Trump's come out yesterday and said that they stole the election from Sanders
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  and that Hillary's a crook and that they're already rigging the polls and rigging the debates.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  And they tried to steal the election from him, but he fought back.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  And it was only because he had a landslide that he was able to stop the superdelegate scam.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  Exactly what we put out in our emergency message to Donald Trump on Saturday.
[01:55.000 --> 02:05.000]  And of course, the White House Run Media Matter says days after conspiracy theorists ask him to Trump worries the election is going to be rigged.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  Well, it's not days after we did. He was already thinking all of this.
[02:10.000 --> 02:23.000]  He sees the same thing we see, but he has responded and I'm not really going to distract into issues of whether Donald Trump listens to the show or not.
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  Or whether I'm not, I talked to Donald Trump. I'm just going to leave it at this.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  Donald Trump doesn't need me or Roger Stone to tell him all this. He knows it.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  And Donald Trump agrees that he's not just going to sit here and watch Hillary do this.
[02:41.000 --> 02:55.000]  They say eight million less people voted with Obama being super unpopular in 2012 and that magically Mitt Romney got millions less votes, eight million less votes than John McCain.
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  Does anyone believe that John McCain was a political Democrat operative they ran as a stand in for Obama to win?
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  Four years later, Obama was unpopular.
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  Mitt Romney clearly won that election and in 2012, guess who came out and said that Donald Trump?
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  Donald Trump's fighting the staged elections. He's fighting the sell out of our jobs.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  He's trying to overthrow the entire rotten media system.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  He's a bellwether of the populist rebellion that's only beginning.
[03:27.000 --> 03:36.000]  He can't lose because even if they steal it from him, we win by pointing out their criminals. Here's the clip.
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media. We have a media that is so dishonest that no matter what makes no difference.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  These people, you know, I've had days where I said, boy, this was a great day.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  I look forward to seeing it tonight or tomorrow and it's brutal.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  I say, what happened? But we're going to punch through the media. We have to.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  The New York Times is totally dishonest, totally dishonest.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  Washington Post has been a little bit better lately, but not good.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  By the way, New York Times, which is failing, really failing badly, which I call it the failing New York Times.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  Every story they write is a hit job.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  I could do the greatest thing in the history of the world.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  I could come up with a cure for the most horrible disease in the world.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  And they give me a front page, horrible, horrible story.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  The New York Times is very dishonest, but it'll be out of business soon, I hope.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  All right, let's stop right there. I'm going to come back and play the rest of the clip, but that's right.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  They're all imploding. They're already bankrupt, singing in New York Times.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're all just become playthings of foreign kingpins and, you know, foreign drug lords.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  I mean, that's what they are. Every criminal, every foreign dictatorship, the Communist Chinese, you name it, they're buying us up.
[05:00.000 --> 05:11.000]  The Islamic State is specifically targeting the U.S. Army, putting out a list of 700 soldiers the terror army wants to kill, reports The Washington Times.
[05:12.000 --> 05:18.000]  United Cyber Caliphate, the Islamic State's three-month-old hacking consortium, has posted a number of such lists.
[05:19.000 --> 05:27.000]  Analysts say most names appear to be publicly available and randomly chosen as opposed to the UCC actually hacking into a website and stealing the information.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  In the July 25th posting by the Islamic State, a Pentagon official told The Washington Times,
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Analysts have not yet found an open source for the Army kill list.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  The possibility is that one or more government sites were hacked, the source said.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  The Islamic State's U.S. Army list begins with the headline.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  We want them hashtag dead, hashtag revenge for Muslims.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  Kill the dogs.

[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Why is this so good?
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[07:16.000 --> 07:24.000]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.000]  These are all parasites.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, InfowarsLife.com.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLife.com.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[07:57.000 --> 08:11.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:12.000 --> 08:20.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:20.000 --> 08:31.000]  If you ever wondered whether Donald Trump is for real or not, there are no doubts now.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  And I can tell you unequivocally, Donald Trump is the real deal, a patriot, battling the globalist
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.000]  and putting his life, his name, his family, his treasure, his blood, sweat, and tears on the line.
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  Donald Trump's going with his gut. He fired his chief strategist today.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  And I am not going to sit here and help the enemy, help the globalist,
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  and basically sit around and brag about how influential Infowars.com is.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  People can see that for themselves. It's not a pleasurable feeling, I will tell you.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  It is a feeling of extreme responsibility.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  And can you imagine the responsibility that Donald Trump feels?
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  Trump has come out and said, we are going to punch through the media.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  He is making it a referendum on the globalist run, deceptive dinosaur media.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  He is coming out and saying, look, Mitt Romney got 8 million more votes,
[09:36.000 --> 09:44.000]  or there was 8 million more votes in that election than there was previously in 2008, but he lost.
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  And he got less votes total than McCain. No strategist believes that.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  There was incredible fraud. Obama was super unpopular then.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  That's why Hillary's so confident.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  And they've had Google de-list him as a presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump.
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  They've had Twitter and Facebook restrict and ban folks exposing what's happening
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  and promoting their right to a First Amendment and their right to support Donald Trump.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  We've seen the debates rigged. We've seen the time of the debates rigged.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  We've seen the Republicans try to come out and say, we are allowed to just ignore the popular vote
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  and just give it to whoever we want. We might even put Paul Ryan in at the convention.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  But patriots, conservatives, paleo-conservatives, libertarians, Christians said, no, we're not buying this.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  And they had to back off.
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  That didn't happen with Bernie Sanders and the Democrats when they stole 10 states.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  He was the winner. He won California, but they met the day before.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  Paul Watson's doing an article on this right now.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  They met the day before at a rich donor's house with the superdelegates
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  and decided what the numbers would be and told the Associated Press who was there
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  who then put out the numbers as everyone watches at night at home with a beer in their hand
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  at 9, 10 o'clock, oh, Hillary's the winner projected with 90-something percent of precincts reporting
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  and then they have the little numbers pre-agreed with the Associated Press that releases the election numbers.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  Just over the top Armageddon-level fraud to our republic.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  And then they even have a New York Daily News article about it.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  Other articles admitting it happened.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  And then I talked to people on the street and they go, yeah, I'm not voting for Hillary.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  I'm a Democrat. I've been canvassing on the streets.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  I'm going to vote for the Green Party or Gary Johnson.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  No, vote for Trump.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  And then I talked to them about, you know, Sanders really won.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  And they go, oh, I heard there was some election fraud.
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  And I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  The delegates just stood down and the superdelegates just announced numbers.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  And they go, really, I'd like to see a news article on that.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  I was in a store today showing a lady on my phone the articles.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  People know there was fraud. They don't really know exactly what happened.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  They're low information voters, Democrats especially. Let's face it.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  We've got to get this information out to them.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  Mark Dice went out again and nine out of 10 Californians.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  We're not cherry picking here.
[12:29.000 --> 12:39.000]  Our correspondent Mark Dice, markdice.com, he went out and told Democrats or people just on the street that Trump is going to ban tampons.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  And they are just horrified.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  And of course, some had actually heard this was happening.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  And that's just how horrible Trump is.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  You could tell them that Trump is a Martian that wants to eat your baby's brain.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  They'd believe it.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  These are dangerous people.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  And Trump is betting that there are enough people who are halfway sane.
[13:03.000 --> 13:13.000]  And who do want their jobs back and who do want the globalists to take their foot off our neck.
[13:14.000 --> 13:22.000]  Some are saying, and we war game this over the weekend.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  Some are saying, oh my gosh, if you come out and say Hillary stole the primary.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  And Hillary is an illegitimate nominee.
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  And if you put that out to voters, they're going to get discouraged and not go vote for Trump thinking there's going to be fraud.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  And that's how the media is spinning it with the headlines like Trump prepares to lose election.
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.000]  And oh, he's a sore loser or oh, he sees she's come back in the polls to neck and neck when he was seven, 10 points ahead a week ago.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  And it's still ahead in most real polls.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  They just put out fake polls.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  They admit her fake with new algorithms to show him in a dead heat.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  So he comes out and points this out.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  That's the only way to battle it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  He did this six months ago.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  He did this three months ago when they were still trying to steal the election from him in the primary.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  He didn't put up with it like Sanders did.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  He called it as a fraud.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  The media said he was a sore loser.
[14:25.000 --> 14:38.000]  In fact, when you read this Gawker article, you guys print me that Gawker article, it's so surreal because they quote the facts about when Trump was winning the states, but the super delegates weren't going for him.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  He came out like a sore loser and complained.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let him steal it, but he didn't sit there.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  So they failed.
[14:52.000 --> 15:00.000]  And they think they're going to have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon and we're just going to sit here and go along with it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:01.000]  We're not.
[15:02.000 --> 15:02.000]  I'm going to fight it.
[15:03.000 --> 15:03.000]  Trump's going to fight it.
[15:04.000 --> 15:04.000]  You're going to fight it.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[15:09.000 --> 15:09.000]  And guess what there is?
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  She stole the nomination.
[15:11.000 --> 15:22.000]  If they would have coronated Paul Ryan as they were floating to see if you were that stupid to install him with no delegates or Ted Cruz.
[15:23.000 --> 15:34.000]  I would have been against him because it would have certified fraudulent elections and an end of the Republic and made the parties openly dictators as they already are operating in the shadows.
[15:34.000 --> 15:41.000]  I would say the whole election is thrown out. Hillary has to be thrown out. Paul Ryan has to be thrown out.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  We have to set up new elections just like they do when it's found in other countries that elections are fraudulent.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  This is what they do and they're going to act like we're doing something weird and unorthodox and never heard of.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  They have snap elections in Israel.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  They have them in England.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  They have them all over the place when there is a loss of confidence.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  They have them in Canada.
[16:04.000 --> 16:12.000]  If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  And that's what Trump's preparing to do.
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  He is pure Americana and if he's successful, he will be the second coming in George Washington.
[16:22.000 --> 16:32.000]  And let me tell you, that man is in danger. Everybody should be praying for him and quite frankly, he should be praying for us because we are now engaged in the globalist at the highest levels of the arena.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  We've been doing that for a long time, but the enemy knows that and they are not as arrogant as they used to be.
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  So this is a war.
[16:42.000 --> 16:57.000]  Donald Trump's the figure had the standard to expose the enemy media, to expose the collaborator media, to expose the foreign, deep state, multinationals, Hillary Clinton, the communist, Chinese spy, the spy that sold us out to Russia.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  What nerve they have saying that Donald Trump is an agent of Russia.
[17:03.000 --> 17:11.000]  He just wants to de-escalate tensions, which is what you're supposed to do.
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  We are living in an unprecedented time. I came on Sunday, I came on Saturday, I put out the emergency report, the emergency message Donald Trump.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  I said they stole it from Sanders as you know.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  They tried to steal it from you, you stood up and said no, you had a landslide so they couldn't defeat you.
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  Trump comes out and says I had a landslide so they couldn't steal it from me, but they're going to try just like they did with Sanders.
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  Now we're going to go ahead and play some of these rigged clips. Here he is in Ohio, then next season Pennsylvania, here it is.
[17:45.000 --> 17:58.000]  We got almost 14 million votes. Think of that. More than anybody in the history of Republican primaries.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  That includes some great people like Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the Second World War.
[18:05.000 --> 18:11.000]  He did win the Second World War. Got elected because he won the Second World War. I got more votes than him. That's good, right?
[18:11.000 --> 18:18.000]  And remember this, I had 17 people. I wasn't running against two people. I had 17 people.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  Hillary Clinton, I got a similar number to Hillary Clinton and she had Bernie and she had a hard time putting Bernie away.
[18:25.000 --> 18:33.000]  And Bernie, poor Bernie, he looked so upset. You know what? He made a mistake. He shouldn't have made a deal.
[18:33.000 --> 18:40.000]  Sometimes he lost, he lost. First of all, it was rigged and I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.
[18:41.000 --> 18:50.000]  Because I think my side was rigged. If I didn't win by massive landslides, I mean think of what we won in New York and Indiana, California, 78%.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  That's with other people in the race.
[18:53.000 --> 19:02.000]  And you're going to hear Donald Trump more, a little bird told me, with orange hair.
[19:03.000 --> 19:11.000]  You're going to be hearing a lot more about this, ladies and gentlemen, because Donald Trump's not going to let you be robbed, myself be robbed, or him be robbed or his family.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  And Crooked Hillary thinks they're going to pull it on Mitt Romney.
[19:16.000 --> 19:23.000]  Mm-mm, lady, it ain't going to happen. And that's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  What Trump's doing, you're right, it is dangerous, isn't it? Actually standing up to you.
[19:29.000 --> 19:36.000]  Actually calling you for what you are and saying, we're not backing down. We're not going quietly into the night.
[19:36.000 --> 19:46.000]  And oh, guess what? Everywhere he goes, there'll be in giant stadiums that are certified for 5,000.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  We went and looked it up another 10,000 and they let 1,000 in and say, sorry, nobody else.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  And this is a guy that owns buildings, owns stadiums.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  He looks around and he goes, they're doing this on purpose.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  And they go, oh, Hillary comes in the same day and the mayor's there.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  She has a tiny crowd and she thanks the mayor.
[20:06.000 --> 20:12.000]  These are Democrat cesspool cities, nice cities, but run by Democrat cess.
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  I don't know what cess is, that's floating, rotting, detritus.
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  It's a sewage sludge.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  So let's go to the next rigged clip.
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  Here he is now in Pennsylvania, calling Clinton El Diablo.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Bernie Sanders, people all walked out.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  He had this mass exit, nobody showed it.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  And then when they showed Bernie, very angry, they're talking about Bernie, because he made a bad deal.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  He should have not made a deal.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  He would have gone down and done something really important.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Once he made that deal, and believe me, he has buyer's remorse.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  You know, this guy has buyer's remorse.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  He looked at that and he was so angry when they were talking about him.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  And his people are angry at him and they should be.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  He would have been a hero.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  She's the devil.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  He made a deal with the devil.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  Now I played this at the very start of the broadcast.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  I want to play this full clip here and this is history.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  You want a leader, you want someone to stand against the globalist.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  He is electronically, but also physically marching against the fourth of state.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  A captured, sold out media that told you Obamacare was free and there were no death panels.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  When the bill said it would double and triple prices within three years,
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  that the IRS would find you up to $5,000 a person for not having it.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  And then it was written by foreign insurance companies to massively increase their profits.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  And they sat there and told you that I was a racist conspiracy theorist
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  that didn't like black people on MSNBC because I didn't like Obamacare.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  Remember that clip?
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Alex Jones is deeply racist.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  He doesn't like Obamacare because Barack Obama's black.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  No, it was because I read the bill.
[22:06.000 --> 22:12.000]  Then we got Gruber to say we're lucky the American people are so stupid
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  and have short attention spans because this doubles and triples prices.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  And I was hired on how to spin it so we could deceive them.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  And Obama was very proud of me that I was the best liar.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  Those are quotes.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  Then he said that was an accident.
[22:28.000 --> 22:29.000]  I didn't mean it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  Then they found more than 10 videos of him saying the same thing.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  Some of them on C-SPAN.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  What does that tell you about their mindset?
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  They go on C-SPAN with a bunch of other professors and statisticians
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  and talk about how to deceive the people.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  And everyone sits there smiling and rubbing their hands together.
[22:50.000 --> 22:51.000]  This is what they've created.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  You go to college now and get a PhD on learning how to scam and rob everyone.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  Jonathan Gruber.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  And they sit around like the Hillary Delegate going,
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  oh, she told me we're going to get the guns.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  We just have to act like we don't want them and we just want reasonable restrictions.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  But as soon as she gets in, we're going to ban everything.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  They released the video within a day.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  People are running up to her on the street.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  She's running from them.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  This is who they are.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  This is who they are.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  They just sit around.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  I was working out with Pat Riley this morning and he said,
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  walking his dog yesterday by his house in Austin, East Austin.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  He saw a full-grown 50-year-old man with a Pokemon backpack on,
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  like a turtle backpack, a giant turtle shell playing Pokemon.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  It's a Pokemon on purpose.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Pocket monsters,
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  which turns you into a Google mapping system.
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  It's actually AI, you're there mapping.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  I mean, they admit that, but it doesn't matter,
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.000]  it's like a joke about it, like a TV watching you.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  And he saw him going along and Pat said,
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  boy, that's who I'm competing against.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  It's this whole world of like, be a baby.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  Don't ever grow up.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  Just suck your thumb.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  They're not putting you into this position
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  because they plan on letting you live out your life as a thumb-sucking
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  50-year-old male that thinks he's a five-year-old
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  or a 20-year-old woman who thinks she's a baby
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  and then sicko men are into her.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  This is what happens right before a culture collapses.
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  And Donald Trump is just a archetypal thrashing death rose
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  as we try to climb out of the molten lava
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  and like Darth Vader and survive.
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  I don't know if we will, but I want to salute Donald Trump
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  for incredible courage.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  And I want to say this, I want to pray for Donald Trump.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  In fact, I was praying for him this morning.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  I was praying for this country.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  I was praying for my family on my knees,
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  but it was so spiritual and real this morning
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  that I tend to do it on air, but I don't feel it right now.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  I feel sincerity, but not like I felt this morning,
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  you know, total connection, but I'm going to,
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  as soon as it hits me today, and I think it will,
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  I'm going to say a prayer on air.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  It might be just in the middle of an interview, I don't know,
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  but man, I tell you, just thank God
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  that I'm not one of these deceived people.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Thank God I don't want to be part of the murder of innocents.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  Thank God I don't want to be part of the human, animal,
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  splicing, chimering programs.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  Thank God I'm aware of what's going on
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  and not part of the enemy's camp.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  That's really what matters here.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  These are souls and our integrity and who we are.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  Don't be discouraged if they steal it from Trump.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  He's not going to go along with it.
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  This is going to be a great awakening.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  And he said, the New York Times, you're done.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  CNN, you're done.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  They're already bankrupt.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  They're already propped up by mega banks
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  that get unlimited trillions from the public.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  And people ask, well, then why are they still there?
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  They have to have the facade going so that people don't realize
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  that it's a tiny minority that even support this New World Order.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  I can't find Hillary supporters unless I go to the richest area of Austin
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  and I see her signs.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  They don't exist.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  Leigh Ann couldn't find anyone on the streets of LA who was for Hillary.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  They were all for Sanders or Trump, the majority for Sanders.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  She went and did an exit poll, 8 out of 10 coming out,
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  said they voted for Sanders, but Sanders lost.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  And then we have them admitting they met the night before with the AP,
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  with the super PAC people and the super delegates
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  and decided what the numbers would be and what Sanders would get
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  and what Hillary would get.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  And we have the super delegate from California saying months before in New Hampshire,
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  we'll decide what Sanders gets and we'll decide what Hillary gets
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  on a power trip, arrogantly admitting it,
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  just like previous on TV saying we don't care about the votes.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  So we're going to put together the informational videos
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  that have all these people talking and bragging
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  and then cut to Trump saying they're going to rig it
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  and then cut to the media, we're taping it today,
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  making fun of Trump saying it's rigged.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  We're going to show you them admitting it's rigged,
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  then we're going to show Trump saying it's rigged
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  and then we're going to show them saying he's crazy.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  I'll tell you quite frankly, it's scary to see other media outlets
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  and other groups don't even know how to fight this.
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  We do.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  I wish everybody else knew how to fight it because I don't like being
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  the one right up front tip of the spear with the White House
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  looking right down at me.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  Going, we need to shut this guy up.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  We need your prayers.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  You better believe it, just as much as Donald Trump does.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  Let's go out with him declaring war on the enemy.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  Donald Trump, we salute you. Here it is.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  We have a media that is so dishonest that no matter what,
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  makes no difference, but these are among the most dishonest people
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  you'll ever, ever meet.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  These people, you know, I've had days where I said,
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  boy, this was a great day.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  I look forward to seeing it tonight or tomorrow and it's brutal.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  I say, what happened?
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  But we're going to punch through the media.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  We have to.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  The New York Times is totally dishonest, totally dishonest.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  Washington Post been a little bit better lately, but not good.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  By the way, New York Times, which is failing, really failing badly,
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  which is, I call it the failing New York Times.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  Every story they write is a hit job.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  I could do the greatest thing in the history of the world.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  I could come up with a cure for the most horrible disease in the world.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  And they give me a front page, horrible, horrible story.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  The New York Times is very dishonest, but it'll be out of business soon, I hope.
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  It'll be out of business.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  It will.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  Really dishonest reporters.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  Not all of them, but most of them.
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  And CNN reporters, CNN, it's like all Trump all the time.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  All Trump all the time.
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  You walk out of an interview, you said that was a good interview,
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  and then you get killed for the rest of the weekend.
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000]  I tell you, they are so biased toward crooked Hillary.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  You know, they call it CNN Clinton News Network.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  CNN Clinton News Network.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  CNN Clinton News Network.
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  Totally dishonest.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  There's more. It's on infowars.com.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  I'm going to come back and lay out the battle plan to defeat these people.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  They can be defeated. We have a major opportunity now.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  The Ohio mayor that restricted the size of Trump rallies
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  as campaigned with Hillary Clinton
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  reports the American Mirror.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  Less than 24 hours ago, Columbus Mayor Andrew Jinter
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  campaigned with Hillary Clinton during a visit to the city.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  He even got a shout out from the candidate herself
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  with Clinton telling the crowd she was happy to be in his capital city.
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  The mayor posted his photo on his Facebook page.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  Clearly pleased to be aiding Clinton.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Are you ready to build a future that includes everyone in America?
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  Jinter said, according to the Post Gazette,
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  we are so honored to have such a great outpouring of support
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  for Secretary Clinton in the most important city
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  in the most important state in America.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  I need a partner in the White House that can deliver.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  Trump said his crowd size was restricted by the fire marshal,
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  but the nominee said that the building could hold several more people.
[30:53.000 --> 31:01.000]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[31:05.000 --> 31:07.000]  secret 12, that's two, SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostigar, SilverBullet.
[31:08.000 --> 31:09.000]  I use them all. They're phenomenal.
[31:10.000 --> 31:11.000]  They work by info.
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  Thank you, brother.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  I am a relatively short time listener
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[31:28.000 --> 31:29.000]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.000]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX,
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.000]  and Nathan DiDio.
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  Why, God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[31:36.000 --> 31:37.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[31:38.000 --> 31:39.000]  What products are you taking?
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to WinnerSun, X2,
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  even got a little DNA force.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  So when I just re-upped everything
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  and I just went to Autofill,
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  and to see the reviews for yourself.
[31:55.000 --> 32:24.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  For the glory of InfoWar's life,
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  we've brought out a lot of amazing products
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality,
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.000]  and so many others.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.000]  with its unique delivery system
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.000]  and proprietary manufacturing process
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  designed for maximized effects.
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  This formula is the platinum standard
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  of multivitamin mineral products.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  are either plant-derived
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[32:57.000 --> 33:25.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  The communist Chinese government is officially announcing
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  that they may strike the United States at any time
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  and they've gone directly to a war footing.
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  That is only one click of the dial
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  from an actual launch protocol.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  They have the ICBMs, the cruise missiles,
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  the guidance systems, the MIRV technology,
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  the boost systems, the reentry systems,
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  everything from the Clintons.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  I actually think this could be a setup sneak attack.
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  This country is going to go under judgment
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  and quite frankly, maybe we deserve it
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  because there seems to be no end
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  to the evils that this nation will put up with.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  The country is struggling trying to get out of the
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  boa constrictor-like hold that the New World Order has on us.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  But if you're not praying every day
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  that the scales be lifted from the people's eyes
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  and that the evil men and women in power be brought down,
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  then you are suicidal.
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  All right.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  Donald Trump said on Sunday
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  that the gloves were going to be coming off this week.
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  The gloves did come off this week
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  and you're going to see more of the gloves coming off.
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  He says we're going to punch through the controlled media
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  and that they need to collapse,
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  that they're already insolvent, they are insolvent.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  And we are going to be writing articles about
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  the different foreign media outlets,
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  the different foreign combines from China
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  to Saudi Arabia
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  to other organizations that are Mexico
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  and their largest billionaire kingpin
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  who actually makes money off U.S. taxpayers
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  with the Obama phone program.
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  He owns that, are in contract.
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  That's who owns the New York Times.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  So we're going to be exposing exactly the foreign interests
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  that own our trader media.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  And you understand,
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  it doesn't matter if the New York Times loses
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  60, 70, 80 million a year.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  It doesn't matter if CNN's defraud.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  It doesn't matter if MSNBC's collapsed.
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  They have to keep the facade up
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  and we're going to now advertise that those facades
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  are foreign owned and run.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  Oh yes, you just want to fight.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  You better believe you've got one
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  because Donald Trump is willing to risk his life
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  and go head up against you
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  and expose the entire election fraud system
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  that he exposed in 2012
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  and he's willing to expose the foreign banks
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  and the communist Chinese infiltration
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  and every bit of it.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  And that's why the horror media is up there
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  saying he's a Russian agent.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  The Russians have their own interest
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  and they are involved in espionage
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  in this country and it's illegal
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  and it's thanks to Hillary again
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  that they've gotten the uranium
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  and some of the technology secrets
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  just like the communist Chinese.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Just like North Korea got its reactors
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  to build bombs, atomic and hydrogen bombs
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  from Hillary and Bill and ABB
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  in the mid 1990s.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  Always the same culprits
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  but they can point their finger and say
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  there's your foreign agent,
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.000]  the evil guy that builds buildings
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  and golf courses and homes
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  and companies and employs people.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  He's the bad one.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  He's the evil one.
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  He's an economist.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  He's got an economics degree.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  He's not a lawyer.
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  We need more lawyers.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  We need more communist Chinese spies.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  That's what we need, not him.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  He's the problem.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  Bad Donald Trump, bad.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  Shame on you.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  And they hope that a bunch of weak minded idiots
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  out there
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  will not understand what's going on
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  and will not be aware of what's unfolding.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  Now, I'm going to let you know
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  about the specials we're running right now.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  We are running a special that's even bigger
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  than last week, that was our biggest special
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  in our history.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  Now to be technical, we're only selling
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  three things that are better deals
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  than last week.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion,
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  brain force, DNA force,
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  40% off brain force, 30% off DNA force.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  And vitamin mineral fusion,
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  which is an amazing fruit punch,
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  totally natural, organic,
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  where your body then can absorb
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  all the nutrients and get the trace elements
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  it needs, simply amazing.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  And then on top of it, why is it a better deal?
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  Because that was the same price
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  that was last week discounted.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  And if you sign up for auto-ship,
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  an additional 10% off,
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  that's 50% off brain force
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  when you sign up for auto-ship.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  40% when you don't.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  Now continuing,
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  we have a lot of other specials as well,
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  but you always get 10% off
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  when you sign up for auto-ship on any item.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  We also have specials going on
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  some of the Patriot apparel.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  We have the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  We have the Hillary for prison shirt.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  This is now reached
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  a crescendo level
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  of the desperate straights this country is in.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  But the fact that we can use this as an opportunity
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  to really expose the power structure
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  that's gone too far
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  and finally turn this around.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  So store-wide free shipping,
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  additional 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship,
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  40% off brain force,
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  and so much more.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  But the really big deal is 30% off DNA force.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  We rarely do that.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  And I intend to extend these sales through next week.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  While supplies last,
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  the problem is DNA force is probably set to sell out
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  in the next three or four days.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  So we'll probably have to pull that special.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  So take advantage of that.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  Go read the hundreds of studies.
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  The patented ingredients like bio-PQQ
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  and find out why it's such a game changer
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  and that similar formulas
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  cost up to $400 to $500.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  from our research, incredible low price,
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  $19.95.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  A bottle of melatonin of the same dose
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  is usually $19.95.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  This has got the same dose in it
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  known to give you deep, restful sleep.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  And I forget to take it sometimes
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  when I'm all hyped up,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  like lately I ran out at home,
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  right now I'm trouble sleeping,
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  I never used to, but I mean,
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  when stuff is this epic,
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  when stuff's going on like this,
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  I gotta be honest with you,
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  I'm bouncing off the walls without stimulus.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  I've been having like one coffee a day
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  and I stopped working.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  And like I said,
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  I'm gonna be taking some time off
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  from the radio just to codify the videos,
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  the news reports, the special reports,
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  the news articles, the research
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  to prove the election fraud
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  in 2012 and in the primaries this year,
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  which is already proven.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  The primaries were open and shut,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  they went too far.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  And to really reach out to the burning people
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  and everybody else because
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  nobody else is gonna do it.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  I'm gonna do it.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  And so is Trump.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  And I guess the global is saying
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  I'm looking for trouble, you bet I am.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  You people came looking for trouble?
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  I'm sorry, you know, we're killing
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  enough babies at the abortion areas
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  and keeping them alive and selling
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  their organs and feeding hospitals
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  with their dead bodies and splicing
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  them with animals and they got TVs
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  watching everybody and they admitted
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  on the news and it's, you're a kook
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  if you don't like it and they're trying
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  to get it done, however the chips fall,
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  I'm done playing games.
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  Obama has now warned Republicans,
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  oh get me this new video,
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  this just went up on dredgerport.com,
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  we'll get it up on infowars.com.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Obama, Trump unfit, woefully unprepared
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  for presidency, has to be a point
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  where you say enough.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  See, they're getting ready to suspend
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  the elections, they're getting ready
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  to start race riots, they're getting,
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  because they know he's a patriot,
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  because they got his phones tapped
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  and they know he's a patriot
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  and willing to lose his life.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  This is unprecedented to have
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  hundreds of top Republicans who
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  have always been Rhino, Neocon,
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  Globalist come out from Brent
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  Scrocoff right down to George
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  Herbert Walker Bush saying he's
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  unfit, they're going to vote for
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  Hillary, who the Bush is vacation
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  with, who sold us out to the
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  Communist Chinese.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  It was the Bushes that sold us out
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  and we have foreign interests
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  that have sold us out and are
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  literally shutting off our
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  power plants.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  They shut off more than three of
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  our power plants a week, China
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  gets more than three a week.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  We are under economic warfare by
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  Globalist.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  We're going to get that video,
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  we're going to play it, it's going
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  up on infowars.com right now.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  This is it, we finally got a
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  candidate that's a patriot, we
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  are going to get that video,
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  that beat the Republicans trying
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  to suspend the election,
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  trying to just install Paul
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  Ryan and now they're in the
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  news acting like Trump's a
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  Cooke, going nobody tried to
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  steal something from him in the
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  primary, nobody took anything
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  from Bernie Sanders and Bernie
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  Sanders supporters are all
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  over going, yeah you did, yeah
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  you did, see, Trump knows what
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  he's doing, he'll get the Sanders
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  support.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  They are going to realize that
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  this is happening and that this
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  is going on.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  But I want to thank the viewers,
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  I want to thank the listeners for
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  your financial support, buying
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  things like water filtration
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  systems, so you don't have to
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  glyphosate in the fluoride on the
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  garbage, getting things like
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.000]  non-GMO, high quality heirloom
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  seeds, getting things like the
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  books, the films, the videos to
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  you meet like-minded people and
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  buy the nutraceuticals because
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  I just can't believe Info Wars
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  is there with Drudge and
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.000]  Breitbart and the Daily Caller
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  and a few others and obviously
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  the patriots of this country
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  of a race, color and creed
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.000]  standing against the Pope
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  and the Communist Chinese and
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  the Saudi Arabians and the
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  Mexican presidents and Mexican
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  presidents and all these people
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  that are involved in all these
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  horrible things, telling us
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  we can't have Trump and now the
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  president holds a press conference
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  of political correctness because
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.000]  he said, hey, why isn't that
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  Muslim woman speaking?
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  I don't like it in the Muslim
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  culture that women aren't allowed
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.000]  to speak and got to wear hoods
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  up with their heads.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Absolutely, we're sick of it.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  Trump can't go to Saudi Arabia
[43:57.000 --> 43:58.000]  or Egypt.
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  That's what all of this has
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  come down to.
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  That's what we face as a society
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.000]  and as a culture.
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  Remember, they said Drudge was
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.000]  a cook in the media.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  They said Drudge is crazy.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  He's making a big deal out of the
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  fact that they canceled elections
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  and they had Cruz.
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.000]  I mean, that's completely normal.
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  And look at this cook Trump.
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.000]  I mean, you know, he saw 8
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  million more people vote and
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  then he magically gets more or
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  less votes than McCain did
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  in 2012.
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  That's obviously fraud and then
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  they openly try to steal it from
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  Trump and he dares speak about it
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  when they're rigging everything
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  from Google to you name it.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  Now, let's go ahead and play
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  this incredible real clear politics.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  This is Obama addressing the press
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  and he says he's woefully unfit.
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  Six minute club. Here it is.
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  Given the Republican nominees
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  recent comments about the Khan
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  family and his statement that
[45:15.000 --> 45:16.000]  if present, he would consider
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.000]  recognizing Russia's annexation
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  of Crimea. Does it make you
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  question his fitness to be president?
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  And secondly, sir, on Libya,
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  you've said in the past that
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  the worst mistake of your presidency
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  may have been your failure to plan
[45:31.000 --> 45:32.000]  for the aftermath of that 2011
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  NATO intervention in Libya.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  Do you see your new decision
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  to bomb ISIS there as a direct
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.000]  result of that?
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.000]  Yes.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  I think the Republican nominee is unfit
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  to serve as president.
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  I said so last week
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  and he keeps on proving it.
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.000]  Hit pause.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  Back it up 10 seconds if you can.
[45:57.000 --> 45:58.000]  This is a guy
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.000]  who
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  funded the Muslim Brotherhood
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  and ISIS and al-Qaeda to take down
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  at least four countries.
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.000]  This is a guy who tells you
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  that you're a bitter clanger
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  of your Christian and own guns.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  This is a guy that has complete
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  slavery and has bankrupted it
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  even more and broken every promise
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  he made and foisted Obamacare
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  on the people that took more than
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  35 million Americans out of
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  full-time, higher-paid jobs
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  into part-time, low-paid jobs
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  because the corporations wrote it
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  that way to drive down wages
[46:33.000 --> 46:34.000]  and create a giant glut of labor.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  This is a guy doubling
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  black unemployment.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  This is a guy in Africa
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  basically installing leadership
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  so that women have to sign agreements
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  to be sterilized or to have abortions
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  to get a tiny micro loan.
[46:50.000 --> 46:51.000]  This is a guy literally
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  out to kill black people
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  and I've got to hear all day
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  how much he loves them.
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  I mean he is an abomination
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  and then he sits there and says
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  this man is unfit
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  because he has top of his class
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  economics degree
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  and built
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  a $50-plus billion company
[47:12.000 --> 47:13.000]  and himself is worth over $10
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  billion and you say
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  he is it fit
[47:18.000 --> 47:19.000]  when we don't even know what
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  your real name is and they found
[47:22.000 --> 47:23.000]  new brochures from the 1997
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  that you put out saying
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.000]  you were born in Kenya
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  which we all know was a scam to hide
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  who your daddy really was
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  and we bought it for a while.
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.000]  Frank Marshall Davis.
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  That's a scandal that you lived
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  as a pornographer, he wrote that
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  in dreams of my real father.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  That's a scandal enough
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  and then it's a spitting image
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  it's daddy we got mommy posing
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  naked on the couch
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  that he's photographed on later
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  open and shut.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  You know why they put Obama in
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  because he's totally blackmailed
[47:59.000 --> 48:00.000]  folks by all these foreign
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  interests and we are basically
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  blackmailed by Saudi Arabia
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  we are totally screwed over.
[48:07.000 --> 48:08.000]  We are in red level crisis
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  and you know the good news
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  the military almost to a person
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  knows it this little scam
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  saying Trump doesn't like the
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  military and made fun of this
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  dead soldier or whatever that's
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  all made up.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  He said why does Khan have his wife
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  up there not talking with her
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  private face covered up.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  That's what he said
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  total distraction from Hillary
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  is in Syria in Libya in
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  Egypt.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  That's the outrage that's what's
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  a big issue.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  Folks I do not have words again
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  to describe to you how historic
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.000]  all of this is how over the top
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  how all of this is how amazing
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  this all is.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  People keep saying well if Hillary
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  is going to steal the election
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  what's the point of Trump saying
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  it doesn't he want to encourage
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  people to vote because landslides
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  stole the nomination.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  Listen to me carefully okay
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  the issue is she stole the
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  nomination she's a fraud
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  and that the Bernie people
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  shouldn't just forget about that
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  and we move on like Goldfish
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  with 10 second memory spans
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  and attention spans and that we
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  have to make this the big issue
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  and put out the reports
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  and the videos call them ads
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  if you want
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  showing how they stole it
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  they did
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  showing how Trump stood up and
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  said no so they had to back off
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  he's doing the right thing he's
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  coming out and speaking about
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  this so that they understand
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  he's not going to play games
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  and so it's a referendum on
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  overthrowing the corrupt
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  occupiers of this country the
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  foreign interest that run both
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  political party machines who are
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  now showing the fact that the
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  Republican Party is trying to
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  look at leadership say they're
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  going basically in voting for
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  Hillary Clinton this doesn't
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  discredit Trump that are known
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  occupiers our enemies the
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  traders are putting everything
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  they can against him it's why
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  we must have him they're the
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  ones running us in the ground
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  they're the ones bankrupting us
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  they're the ones starting the
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  wars they're the ones engaging
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  in all this evil they're the
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  ones coming after our guns they're
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  the ones federalizing the churches
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  with the face based initiative
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  they're the ones federalizing
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  local schools they're the ones
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  federalizing local police they're
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  the ones funding the race war
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  they're the ones funding the
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  division they're the ones making
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  you pay for people to have sex
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  changes and pay for abortions
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  they're the ones they're the
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  ones they're the globalist they're
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  the enemy they're the problem
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  you and it's taking just
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  magic beautiful Yankee
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  like Donald Trump to stand up
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  and say you want to come after
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  me go ahead but I'm standing up
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  for this country are you
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  prepared to bug out infidel body
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  armor and an army Ranger have

[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  that offers freedom from insurance

[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  the Obamacare individual mandate
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  imagine having access to quality
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  affordable health care that allows

[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  regular, physically immune
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.940]  grid problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar generators really do provide
[52:16.940 --> 52:21.820]  life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[52:21.820 --> 52:26.140]  emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous summer
[52:26.140 --> 52:30.940]  storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through
[52:30.940 --> 52:35.100]  it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[52:35.100 --> 52:39.700]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're
[52:39.700 --> 52:44.200]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[52:44.200 --> 52:49.780]  price for M4Wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's
[52:49.780 --> 52:54.740]  gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum

[53:00.640 --> 53:04.640]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.200]  has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.660]  these devices. The solution is Defender Shield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding

[53:30.300 --> 53:34.820]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become? In these days of terrorist attacks,
[53:34.820 --> 53:39.040]  natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep
[53:39.040 --> 53:45.420]  your family safe. I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomenbloom.net, where you'll find an entire line of uniquely
[53:45.420 --> 53:50.060]  designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way. For everything from

[54:26.580 --> 54:33.320]  We're making them come out and try to legitimize having superdelegates ignore giant landslides
[54:33.320 --> 54:39.760]  in primaries for Donald J. Trump. And as Trump said, it's hard to beat a landslide, and that's
[54:39.760 --> 54:42.880]  how we're going to try to stop this fraud. But if they do engage in fraud, we're going
[54:42.880 --> 54:48.080]  to catch them. And that's why Hillary's Chief of Staff calls it extremely dangerous, which
[54:48.080 --> 54:56.200]  is a threat. I hope the audience will come before God, even if you've not been a spiritual
[54:56.200 --> 55:00.760]  person or a Christian in your life. I pray that you will understand that there is such
[55:00.760 --> 55:09.760]  a thing as providence and just focus on the fact. If you're a Christian, pray with me
[55:09.760 --> 55:13.780]  that had your protection, we put up around Donald J. Trump and all of us that are fighting
[55:13.780 --> 55:19.560]  for truth and justice, and that all of the enemy's plans, we turned against them, and
[55:19.560 --> 55:27.280]  that we'd be given discernment and providence to overcome the enemy. But in the end, whatever
[55:27.280 --> 55:35.360]  God's will is, that is justice. And that we know in God's plan, this will all turn out
[55:35.360 --> 55:41.760]  to be for a very, very good reason. And just pray to God that we understand how incredible
[55:41.760 --> 55:50.680]  this period of history is right now, and that we thank God for Donald Trump, because Donald
[55:50.680 --> 55:58.880]  Trump is putting himself under the full media and psychic and cultural attack of the enemy.
[55:58.880 --> 56:04.280]  And it's real. It's not a put on. This is 100% real. The energy level is just rising
[56:04.280 --> 56:16.960]  to an absolute cacophony, a crescendo, a finale, a coup de gras, a Goudre Dumarong
[56:16.960 --> 56:22.880]  battle. It's a twilight of the gods, all right. These would be gods of the New World
[56:22.880 --> 56:34.320]  Order. They're no gods at all. Rock no Rook. And this is only the beginning. Know this.
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.800]  Trump's going to launch a TV network after this if they steal it. He's got sons that
[56:38.800 --> 56:45.360]  are even smarter than he is. This is only the beginning of the fight. Strike us down.
[56:45.360 --> 56:55.280]  Call Donald Trump. Sons become 10 times more powerful. Kill Alex Jones. My message becomes
[56:55.280 --> 57:01.040]  10 times more powerful. The enemy knows. They cannot win long term if we fight. We have
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.960]  the truth on our side. Now, let's go to Washington to where the enemy, this morning, just an
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.880]  hour ago, the full videos on infowars.com and Rogerport.com, real clear politics from
[57:09.880 --> 57:16.600]  cease man. The enemy for six minutes declared that you can't have Donald Trump. And he is
[57:16.600 --> 57:22.000]  afraid they know he's landslide ahead. My numbers are about 15 points ahead nationwide
[57:22.000 --> 57:32.080]  ahead of Hillary. Oh, yeah, just like Bernie was. They're scared. It's by the clip. Yes,
[57:32.080 --> 57:39.160]  I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president. I said so last week.
[57:39.160 --> 57:54.960]  And he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a gold star family, that they
[57:54.960 --> 58:00.240]  use this gold star like he attacked a family. He said, what is this woman up here not talking?
[58:00.240 --> 58:04.800]  Pointing that out. So they, they, they greatly strut him in. This is Obama that when cops
[58:04.800 --> 58:11.240]  get killed, he says they need to reform themselves. So more get killed saying it's their fault.
[58:11.240 --> 58:16.880]  This is the guy pushing the Trayvon Martin thing from the beginning to create division.
[58:16.880 --> 58:22.000]  This is the guy ripping off American taxpayers, shutting down our economy, screwing us over
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.920]  outside of law, opening our borders up, inverting reality. And he just goes on babbling. I'm
[58:27.920 --> 58:31.200]  going to come back and play more of this than Matt Bracken's popping in and I'm going to
[58:31.200 --> 58:35.200]  put the phones up for your calls. And we've got a childhood college friend right through
[58:35.200 --> 58:39.760]  Bill Clinton and Hillary described what these monsters really are like. Second hour straight
[58:39.760 --> 58:45.480]  ahead, I'm Alex Jones. This is the defense of more than the Republic to defense of humanity.

[58:51.480 --> 59:04.600]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here
[59:04.600 --> 59:08.720]  at 8 30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[59:08.720 --> 59:12.400]  it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force
[59:12.400 --> 59:16.600]  right there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just
[59:16.600 --> 59:21.720]  kind of clears up. Got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find
[59:21.720 --> 59:26.320]  out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does
[59:26.320 --> 59:31.320]  have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled it all
[59:31.320 --> 59:34.840]  night or like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[59:34.840 --> 59:39.680]  I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[59:39.680 --> 59:46.680]  forcing came in. You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com
[59:46.680 --> 01:00:12.680]  or call 888-253-3139. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Who came alive for the
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:31.680]  first time. I'm Alex Jones and I never play it safe when freedom is on the line. We are
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:37.320]  not going in in the fight against the new order. We're now in it. Engaged in the biggest
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.920]  battle toe-to-toe with the new world order project since Cecil Rhodes launched it over
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:53.080]  130 years ago. We are in the middle of a fight that defines the enemy. That's why the longer
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.440]  we're in this fight, the stronger we get. Bill Scowles is a really smart guy. He said
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.880]  I'm afraid they're going to destroy Trump, set him up, steal the election and then use
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.240]  that to discredit populism and nationalism. Just as they're going to use shutting England
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:12.680]  down for Brexit as a way to punish everybody. That will decide who we are. When the Germans
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:19.840]  bombed London, it made the British want to fight more. When the EU bombs them economically,
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.040]  it should make them understand what they're facing and understand that the parasite was
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.320]  going to suck them dry no matter what so might as well stand up. It's the same thing here.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:38.360]  Trump doesn't lose by losing. He enters the arena forever. Use a Greek analogy. He gets
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:45.840]  a constellation. That's the thing. It isn't about winning. It's about doing the right
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.920]  thing as an example to others. It's about defining things with the truth, not a bunch
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.480]  of damn lies. And they've sucked that out of the world. They've sucked manhood out
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.400]  of the world. People don't even know what they're looking at when they see it. Oh, look
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.080]  at that guy. He's getting ridiculed. He's a loser. Being ridiculed by an enemy press
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.280]  bought and paid for to distract you while the New World Order breaks down our society,
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:21.960]  poisons our culture and reclamates you into the global system. I can tell you right now
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:33.120]  that the people understand what's going on. I can tell you right now that a large enough
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:42.680]  cadre worldwide understands what's happening, that it will grow into a force that is unstoppable
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:50.160]  by anything but God. Donald Trump is a rock star in Africa and in Latin America and in
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.000]  Asia and in Russia and in many areas of Europe, especially with young people. And I've already
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.520]  been seeing this last year because I scan things, but I'm seeing it now in foreign press.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.600]  People get it. The thinkers do. When the whole system that we know is screwing us and out
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.560]  to get us is telling us that somebody is the devil and misrepresenting what he says at
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:19.560]  every turn, this isn't something they're going to be able to put back in the cage. So I'm
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.880]  not giving you a pep talk here. I'm just saying I rarely disagree with Scowson and I don't
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.520]  really disagree with him. I see the perspective. CJ, the same thing this morning. Oh, they're
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.720]  just going to spend this. I walked in and I said, oh boy, that panics the New World
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.360]  Order. Got the White House run folks saying two days after Alex Jones calls for Trump
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.280]  to talk about how only a landslide could block Hillary Clinton from stealing the election
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.160]  because she stole it from Bernie Sanders. Word for word. I said, that's got to really
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.960]  get him upset. And he said, yeah, but we can always pop in him. He wants to talk about
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.760]  it. He said, yeah, but they'll just use us that like he's giving up. That's exactly
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.920]  what they're saying. Putting it in there that, oh, I'm a sort of loser. No, he wasn't a sort
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:04.560]  of loser in the primary. He was winning. They were stealing it. He pointed it out. And that's
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.000]  what he's doing right now. And yes, it's up to us. And CJ agreed. It is a referendum
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.080]  on us. Do we want to stand against the corrupt media that has a 6% trust rate? Do we want
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.320]  to stand against the whole corrupt Republican Democratic establishment? Or do we want to
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:26.040]  just kind of act like we want to be betting on the winner or we care that they get a cacophony
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.600]  of people to just yell and scream in some weird popularity contest that Donald Trump's
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.160]  in trouble. It's all self fulfilling prophecy garbage. I want to say something very important
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:40.680]  when we come back from break, but I'm going to preface it here. We're designed like humans
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.280]  that if we see a bunch of other humans drinking out of a river when we come to a town a thousand
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.480]  years ago as traders, that you can drink out of that water. You know, it's good. Everybody's
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.920]  drinking out of it. If nobody's drinking out of it, you go up and say, where's the well
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.480]  is the water not good? They use that instinct today against us where they have a bunch of
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:03.960]  fake astroturf say something so we feel like it's true. The Islamic state is specifically
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:09.040]  targeting the US army, putting out a list of 700 soldiers. The terror army wants to
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.760]  kill reports the Washington Times. United cyber caliphate, the Islamic state's three-month-old
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.040]  hacking consortium has posted a number of such lists. Analysts say most names appear
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.600]  to be publicly available and randomly chosen as opposed to the UCC actually hacking into
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.240]  a website and stealing the information. In the July 25th posting by the Islamic state,
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.440]  a Pentagon official told the Washington Times, analysts have not yet found an open source
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.600]  for the army kill list. The possibility is that one or more government sites were hacked,
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.480]  the source said. The Islamic state's US army list begins with the headline. We want them
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:53.280]  hashtag dead, hashtag revenge for Muslims. Kill the dogs. You can find more reports on

[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:10.840]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:21.240]  my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.680]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.440]  spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]  parasites.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.560]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:39.520]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.240]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.360]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:49.000]  just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, info wars, life.com. And folks, you can't

[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:27.840]  Live from the Info Wars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones. Just a few hours ago, President
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:36.720]  Obama had a special press conference to demonize Donald J. Trump and say, he is unfit. The
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.720]  reason they're doing that is because, can you imagine the horror at White House Run
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:49.080]  Media Matters? George Soros funded. Jay's apriconspiracy theorist asked him to, Trump
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.960]  worries the election is going to be rigged, and he pointed out that Bernie Sanders had
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.320]  stolen from him, but that Trump was having landslides so they couldn't steal the primaries
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.160]  from him and had to stand down. And that she better not try to steal the election. That
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:07.440]  is my advice, that is Stone's advice, but Trump is already on the same page. And they
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.080]  go into this article horrified that Trump must be doing what we tell him to do. Well,
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.200]  this isn't about a popularity contest. It is surreal to know that our common sense information
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.840]  is listened to by someone because he's not a traitor. But Trump already knows this. What
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.480]  we're saying is common sense. In 2012, when there were 8 million more voters than four
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.880]  years before, Mitt Romney was way more popular in polls than John McCain. He got less votes
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.800]  than the Republican did four years before. There was election fraud and Donald Trump
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:46.400]  came out then and said this should be investigated. Donald Trump's very smart. But more importantly,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.040]  he has the courage to come out and say, I'm not working with the Russians, but if Hillary
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.840]  deleted these emails illegally, I think the Russians should release them. By the way,
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.280]  the Wall Street Journal and others admitted, her chief of staff got 35 million from the
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.440]  Russians in a weapons transfer. Her foundation got hundreds of millions of other dollars
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.320]  connected from Putin. She's the one selling out to everybody. She's the one that sold
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:19.080]  out the launch technology, the guidance systems, the boost phase, the reentry phase, the Merv
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:29.400]  phase, the miniaturization, the entire system for deliverable ICBM payloads of up to 24
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:36.880]  warheads or dummies over North America. Cruise missile submarine launch technology on and
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:43.560]  on and on, reactors to North Korea. So it's so sick to be informed and to sit there and
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:49.800]  watch them claim he's some type of Russian agent. But listen, he's seven to 10 points
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.520]  ahead and that's what closeted folks, not saying they're voting for him. We think there's
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.480]  a seven or 10 point lead on that as well. He could be 10, 15 points ahead of Hillary.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.760]  That's why they're panicking. That's why they had Obama come out today and talk for six
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:09.760]  minutes about how Trump's unfit because he attacks gold star families. No, he saw that
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.080]  Muslim Brotherhood individual up there with his wife who didn't talk and said, why isn't
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.880]  she speaking? That isn't attacking their son. This is perfect straw man and now it's gold
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.800]  star families. But almost the entire military supports Trump. It isn't to get the military
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.720]  to turn against him. It's to get quizlings to think that's happened and have a fake victory.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.000]  But let's play a clip of Obama.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.480]  Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president. I said so last week
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:56.160]  and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a gold star family that had
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:06.880]  made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country. The fact that he doesn't appear
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:20.320]  to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia. This
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.520]  is the guy that says we have 57 states. It means that he's woefully unprepared. That's
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:31.240]  good. Well, you've certainly been prepared to sell us out to the globalist. Trump's got
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:36.360]  good advisors. He knows Hillary is a communist, shiny spy, blackmailed by him. I mean, that's
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.880]  been a fact since the early 90s. But you've got all these top Rhino Republicans coming
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.240]  on against Trump showing that this is the power structure against him. I want to play
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.960]  this clip where he talked about it being rigged and said they couldn't steal it from me because
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.360]  there were such landslides and I didn't go along with it. But Bernie did and he's reaching
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.240]  out to the Bernie supporters who are the vast majority of Democrat voters to come over and
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.440]  vote for him.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.960]  And it's hard to beat a landslide. We've interviewed all the experts. We've researched it in depth.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.920]  Trump is really trying to win. And yes, Trump, if there's evidence of fraud, is going to
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.920]  fight it. Evidence, he stole the nomination. And that's the argument I've made publicly
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:22.840]  in a public outreach to Trump. And I'm going to leave it at that. And you noticed, as the
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.800]  White House points out, less than 48 hours later, basically word for word, but not because
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.720]  I'm telling Trump what to say or do. It's the truth. It's what happened. I chronicled
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.520]  in the video what Trump said and then what transpired months ago. And I'm going to keep
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.640]  doing it. Paul Watts has got another article coming out in the next hour. We're going to
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.000]  just start chronicling how they stole the primaries, them bragging the superdelegates
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.640]  admitting it, how they had a fake election in California. They went too far. We have
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:55.440]  them admitting the fraud. I'm going to say this again. We have them admitting they stole
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.600]  the election from Sanders. They were so arrogant they had to get the other superdelegates to
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.840]  think it was normal and the other delegates so they had to do this gaslighting technique
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.520]  of psychology where they went, of course, the delegates are sovereign and have always
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:15.000]  chosen. They never have. They changed the rule in 72 but never had the nerve to do it.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.680]  There's election laws that block all that. It's all a fraud. We've talked to the experts.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:24.960]  We've studied it. I want to say talk to the experts. I'm an expert, folks. I live this.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.200]  So they had to act normal and go, of course you don't count. That was also to get burning
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.640]  people to give up. But they didn't give up. Then they stole it in front of God and everybody
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.480]  else and we're going to go pull up all the news articles and all the videos and say,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:43.280]  you see what happened? And the White House, I know, is pulling their hair out. Matt Bragg,
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:49.920]  as we was for the full hour, 45 minutes, so we're about to go to him. And quite frankly,
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.080]  I don't get up here and brag about the power of this broadcast just to do it. I had a policy
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.160]  until about three, four years ago to kind of go under the radar and let the arrogance of
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.520]  the establishment just kind of keep them off my back. Because believe me, I've already
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.160]  dealt with a lot of dirty tricks and some other things that is a unconventional warfare.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.320]  Let's just say it's not been enjoyable, but it's part of what I'm doing. I've committed
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:14.200]  to this. It feel good in my gut and in my soul. But you know, my flesh sometimes is
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.000]  like, man, you really got to push this. And I'm like, you bet I'm pushing it all the way.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.480]  I'm going all the way in their face. I'm not giving up. And you see the results. The fact
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.800]  that we have come from a group of one person 21 years ago to 60 people. And that's some
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.600]  of that customer service and packing crew and, you know, custodial. And we're talking
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.880]  maybe 25 people that I have my operation and we are devastating the globalist all over
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.400]  the world. I mean, having huge victories, it shows what you can do. There are so many
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.920]  smarter men than I am. So many great people who don't see it as your role to fight back,
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.000]  who don't see it as your role to take action. It's no secret. Trump's going to gear up
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.560]  a TV network and take you all down. By the way, he's not giving up. This is just round
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:01.760]  one. He's got two sons ready and more. And I've got a son. I intend on producing more.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.120]  This is a war. We're never giving up, never giving in. You understand that? And we're,
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:12.520]  I'm only here to demonstrate the, the beta test. I'm only phase one, baby. The ones coming
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.640]  are a lot worse globalist. This is a long fight. We're going to win it. Understand that
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.160]  and everybody's morale needs to understand that. We're showing you what we can do, what
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.440]  you can do. This is only the beginning. We're never giving up. He's probably going to win
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.600]  the election folks. He already played chicken with them repeatedly because he's willing
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.040]  to run his race car right into them. They're not. We're going to find out how far the new
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.000]  old order wants to go. We're aware of false flags. We're aware of race riots. You're going
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.880]  to go ahead and do this when the cops are almost all awake, the military are now. Let
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.760]  me just explain some of the new world order and to the fear in Obama's eyes. You're scared
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.860]  for a good reason because you're finally up against people that know your whole game
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:58.080]  plan and aren't afraid. Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL bestselling author, his website
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:04.720]  is enemies, foreign and domestic.com. And he's again, I'm got him here. We're going
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.520]  to break in about three minutes. I wanted to set the table here. There's a lot of stations
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.680]  join us in the second, third and fourth hour about how epic a point we've reached. And
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.880]  I know we're going to get into all the Islamic invasion, accelerating Merkel's things. He's
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.480]  going to expand that martial law declared in Germany, troops on the street to suppress
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.800]  the Patriots, accelerating, bringing them in here, you know, larger long-term plan.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.440]  You can see how they want to check bait the Patriots. It's with their Islamic proxy armies.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.880]  They're bringing in. I don't think for false flags now, that's that's to bring in more
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.800]  tyranny phase one, but actually to put them in charge of us as we're now seeing in Europe.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.560]  So Matt Bracken, I mean, just give us about a two, three minute breakdown on what you
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.280]  think's happening right now. And am I wrong about how epic the situation is with Trump
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:50.280]  right now? Not at all. This is this is epic for sure. This past week, I guess we had a
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:56.600]  little lull in the terror war. So we can focus on the media war. I call them a lot of people
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:02.640]  call it the enemy media, enemy media. They are a wholly owned parcel of the Democrat
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.680]  crime family, the crime machine, now the Clinton Obama crime machine. You know, I think at
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:15.840]  this point, Hillary could, you know, perform an abortion and eat the baby. And she would
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.120]  be excused. They would say, well, it was, you know, her own choice or the mother's
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.240]  wait a minute. They have a weird meme. They've put out where she eats babies and it's good.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:30.760]  Were you aware of that? No, nothing would surprise me. We really saw the enemy media
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:37.160]  go full Soviet in the last week. Full Soviet is my term for when we see these administration
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:42.400]  mouthpieces, whether it's Jay Johnson or Ash Carter, look at the camera and say, you know,
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:49.680]  the sky is purple and up is down with a straight face. It's a Soviet, very Soviet in that.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.360]  In the last week, we saw these memes pushed and literally within an hour go completely
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:19:00.600]  through the entire enemy media. One was dark. That was that the RNC convention was dark.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:06.640]  That was in every headline the next morning. We all pointed out memes about that. The other
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.600]  one was Russians. It's the Russians that are the DNC hack. Is all the Russian Trump is
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.120]  a trader. Don't look at what is in the DNC wiki hacks. Look at the fact that it's the
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.800]  Russians and apparently it's, it's not the Russians. If the Russians were doing it, they
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.800]  would want Hillary elected to blackmail her because they'd own her with the top secret
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800]  stuff they've got.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.600]  And it's Hillary again, who has openly been caught at record levels selling uranium and
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.360]  weapons secrets to Putin.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.000]  And enriching her friends, you know, make cutting her friends on these deals for millions
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.400]  of dollars. You know, you insured the silence of your friends by paying them millions. The
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.000]  former DNC chairwoman, she's going to, you know, trundle off into the sunset with millions
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  of dollars.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.200]  The big one though, this week for going full Soviet, I never saw anything like it was this
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:03.160]  guy, Khan, who's absolutely a Muslim brotherhood. His function is what they call civilizational
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:10.760]  jihad. He's the jihadist with a tie, a jacket and a tie, who works for the Clinton law firm.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:15.520]  You know, if you look at the Clinton law firm, the Clinton law firms also produce people
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.840]  like Lynch. You know, you're going to, you're, you, they're very long term in this civilizational
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.840]  jihad.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:28.680]  You know, Huma Ahmadine, she goes way back. You know, all the law firms with Lynch with
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.680]  this guy, Khan, they're all part of the crime syndicate. You know, they're, he put, he went
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.680]  right up on stage, put up the picture of his son and cried the crocodile tears. It was
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:43.520]  very well orchestrated. Unfortunately, Trump stepped in it. You know, he went right into
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:49.480]  the trap, a full steam. I don't think it'll matter after another like big attack like
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:55.680]  Nice or San Bernardino or Orlando. It'll just make Trump look smarter and Obama look like
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.760]  more of a trader. I thought it was great today. Obama was definitely in panic mode and him
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:06.080]  bringing up the names of like Ryan McConnell and McCain. All that does is drive more people
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.720]  to Trump because those are rhino sellouts. Yeah, they're pro-amnesty rhino sellouts.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.440]  Let me ask you this question. You know, a lot of people get confused. I'm against the militarization
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.720]  police for no reason. I'm against asset forwarder seizure without due process. I'm against some
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.200]  of the federal global policies in our police, but on average, the average cops pretty hard
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.160]  working dedicated person. They got a tough job. I don't like some of the revenue generation,
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.800]  but that's political. Just like Congress put in the TSA, but leaves our borders open. I
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:40.480]  don't hate the average TSA person. But clearly, the globalist and the Clinton crime family
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.600]  have been trying to get us with Obama to start a civil war with all this political angst
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.040]  against local government and against the average cop with record numbers, you know, getting
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:55.640]  shot in the back, getting killed and people celebrating it. It's so clear that the right
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:01.280]  moral move, but also the right strategic move, and I've done this the last six, seven years,
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.840]  was to really understand that they want to discredit local government. That's what communists
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.760]  and terrorists always do in the phase where they're trying to fully take over. And I've
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.680]  reached out to the police and military like never before. And I'll tell you, the response
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.720]  has been unbelievable. And I'm not bragging. This happened. Our crew all saw it. I didn't
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.680]  want to get it on video to get them in trouble. The secret service in their suits, but also
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.720]  in their gear at checkpoints everywhere were cheering us. They were talking under their
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.720]  breath saying we're under surveillance camera. I don't want to shake your hand, but we love
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.360]  you. The police, almost all of them were listeners. Black, Hispanic didn't matter. And that's
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.800]  happening all over the country where I see police now and they get tears in their eyes
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:46.560]  looking at me. And I talked to them and they go, we know there's a takeover. We're scared.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.560]  It's not that I'm that smart. They understand the intel that we've really got a globalist
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.800]  takeover. And then I guess that feels good to them that at least somebody knows. But
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.160]  I mean, that's got to worry the new world order that the police and military are so
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.720]  awake. Matt, not only the police and military, but you might, I have a 20 something daughter.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:12.120]  They don't watch TV anymore. They considered television to be, you know, like an RCA radio.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.480]  They watched the internet. I forget where I heard this story, but I think you were on
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:23.800]  an airplane to Cleveland and Carl Rove was on the airplane too. And you were getting
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.120]  cheered and he was getting booed. I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's becoming more
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.920]  overt. But I think by the time I got off the airplane, walking the baggage with him, I'd
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.280]  probably ran into 20 people that, Hey, I saw it on Twitter. I saw the video in a two hour
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:42.480]  flight. By the time I get from Dallas, where I confronted him to Cleveland, it was already
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.960]  everywhere. Again, how do they deal with that?
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:50.120]  They can't. Well, unless they try to suck down the entire internet, that would be like
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:56.680]  my, my essay burning down the house in 2016. If they can't succeed, if it looks like Trump
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:01.760]  is ahead in the polls, then they'll tear it all down. At the very pinnacle, at the very
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.520]  top, we're talking about people that can fly nonstop intercontinental, you know, and land
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:11.360]  at their retreat in Patagonia that's got 10 years worth of diesel for the generator.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.800]  They think that's their backup plan. So no matter how bad it gets here, they'll like,
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.080]  you know, they'll just skip to one of their remote castles.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.000]  Don't they know that people that lose families and things about making threats, what's going
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.280]  to happen? We'll have 10 year projects to get there and find them. I mean, I mean, they're
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.620]  going, don't they know that no amount of security is ever going to protect them if they really
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.620]  do this?
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.520]  Well, plus the security isn't going to stick around for the securities.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.240]  Most of the securities are listeners. Right. So they're not going, it's not going to be
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:44.680]  too happy for them. But that's, that's what their plan, as I often say, a plan to ride
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:50.080]  a tiger is not the same as riding a tiger. It's just a plan. But their plan is no matter
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:55.720]  how bad it gets, it'll be a cleansing. All of the, all of their cooked books will be burned
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.920]  in the fire. There won't be any evidence left. It'll all be like, who cares? At this point,
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:07.840]  what difference does it make after the cities are burning? Who cares? Their plan is sidestep
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.680]  to a private island, a mega yacht, Patagonia, and then come back when the cops let half
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.000]  of them get killed, bringing your new people later.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.200]  Well, that's their plan. I don't think it'll work, but
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:25.760]  Well, when I tell you that almost every single cop, state police officer, I don't care what
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.080]  color they were and secret service agent was a intense listener. That has got the freak
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:38.240]  But the chiefs are, the chiefs are largely sold out politicians. You know, the chiefs
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.480]  are just eager to get more federal handouts and to turn over more of their local sides.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.480]  And again, I'm not talking about me, Matt. I didn't used to do this. I'm in this position
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.640]  now where this is not enjoyable. This, this level of responsibility. I'm just saying,
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.800]  when you're pinging at that level, and that's what quite frankly, you know, I've talked
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.160]  to Trump about and that's what he's seen is that, I mean, I'd be in the arena and there'd
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.840]  be like the head secret service people just smiling at me and waving at me. I'm just saying
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:08.360]  as a radar ping, the fact that I'm supposedly so radical, I'm really not. I'm just Americana.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.320]  The fact that our message has penetrated everywhere, has absolutely got to scare the hell out of
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:16.800]  the new world order because they're not going to run this operation with us flat footed when
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.880]  they're when their own people they're counting on to carry out the treason are so awake.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.480]  And I've had police chiefs that they think are their buddies. Tell me privately, no,
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.160]  I'm not their buddies. Yeah, the boys and girls down in the fusion
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.640]  centers, they all have to be wondering what's going to happen. If they do get orders, for
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.960]  example, to, you know, to economically isolate enemies of the state, it would be very easy
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.920]  to do. You know, you can, they can just trash somebody's credit cards, make it so that they're
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:49.440]  what was it, the Will Smith movie? Nothing works. You know, you just, you the money,
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.160]  the cash in your wallet is all you've got. They can do that pretty easily. But, you know,
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:59.080]  still the boys and girls down in the fusion centers obey, you know, Gestapo like orders.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:04.600]  That's the question. And I, I, I don't know, because of the last eight years, they've only
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:10.320]  been hiring social justice warriors. That's how we wind up with a sold out FBI.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.240]  We just lost Matt Bracken. We're going to get him back skype went out for a moment.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.720]  And again, folks, I keep talking about info wars here. I've been very humble over the
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.320]  years. This is not something I even want to get into. My dad called me this morning and
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:30.440]  he said, so how is it now to be so dangerously in the zeitgeist? And, um, I mean, let me
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.960]  tell you, I'm experiencing stuff that almost nobody ever gets to experience. I mean, and
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:40.720]  believe me, be glad you're not. This is history. And you're sitting here with just Donald Trump,
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.480]  Matt Drudge and a few other people. And you never expected yourself to be in this position.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:49.080]  It's quite a fraternity. Let me tell you, and you know, you're being listened to by the
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:54.080]  good people, but also the bad guys. And you know, you know, you have influence with your
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.160]  common sense and your analysis. And we've got the archive of knowledge. So we're able
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.920]  to get data packages to people that lay it out as briefings. I mean, I'll sit around
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.760]  and prepare a briefing for somebody, you know, for a whole day if I need to, that's what
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.640]  I do. And then I brief people and then they go check it out for themselves. And then it
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.800]  has an effect. Can you imagine being Obama and the globalist? I mean, how about a nightmare
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:24.000]  scenario? A nightmare scenario? I mean, they have constant meetings in Congress about Drudge,
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.080]  how they want to shut him down because they can't control a narrative because they'll
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:31.280]  have Obama say, I never said you can keep your doctor. And then Drudge just puts a link
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:39.280]  up where he says it. That's not magic. I'm not magic. Trump's not magic. If Trump wins
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.920]  by 70 something percent, he gets the delegates, not somebody else. It's not magic. We're saying
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.440]  two plus two equals four. They're not. Again, I agree with you, Matt. I think Obama watching
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.160]  his body language looks completely freaked out. I think because of the closeted voters,
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.400]  I think Trump's probably 15 points ahead. I think they know there's a Trump landslide
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400]  coming.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:05.880]  Yeah, the polls are completely bogus. They're just propaganda push polls. You see a poll
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:11.880]  by a network that is a quizzling network that immediately picks up all the, you know, the
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:20.640]  Soviet style memes, dark RNC convention. Russians did the DNC hack in concert with Trump. Khan
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.760]  is the most wonderful gold star dad in the world and Trump's an evil monster. They've
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:30.840]  gone full Soviet. The polls, you can't believe it all. Nobody under the age of 30 has a landline
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.200]  phone. How do they conduct these polls? Garbage?
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.200]  They're calling Alzheimer's patients. They've got a database of them. They admit it.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.560]  Right. It's garbage in, garbage out. The polls are nothing more than propaganda.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.920]  Yeah, they're Matt Bracken. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, you are watching history
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:50.920]  unfold now. You are in the middle of 1776 part two, and you will determine the outcome.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:30:02.360]  Get on your knees and pray to God. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:07.920]  The Ohio mayor that restricted the size of Trump rallies as campaigned with Hillary Clinton
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:14.080]  reports the American Mirror. Less than 24 hours ago, Columbus Mayor Andrew Jenter campaigned
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.400]  with Hillary Clinton during a visit to the city. He even got a shout out from the candidate
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.040]  herself with Clinton telling the crowd she was happy to be in his capital city. The mayor
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:29.000]  posted his photo on his Facebook page, clearly pleased to be aiding Clinton. Are you ready
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.320]  to build a future that includes everyone in America? Jenter said, according to the post
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.200]  Gazette, we are so honored to have such a great outpouring of support for Secretary
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:45.120]  Clinton in the most important city in the most important state in America. I need a partner
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.760]  in the White House that can deliver. Trump said his crowd size was restricted by the

[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:23.760]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. 800-25-99231. What do you
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.100]  make of Donald Trump coming out and saying we need to landslide and defeat Hillary because
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:36.000]  only landslides defeat attempts to steal elections? Which is true. And they stole the
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.720]  primaries from Bernie. They tried it with me, which is all admitted fact. The mainstream
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:43.080]  media is saying this is crazy. Nobody stole anything from Bernie. There were never super
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:47.560]  delegates claiming that Trump could be blocked. It was all over every TV channel for months.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.360]  It's all completely admitted. But they just say it never happened. I've got thousands
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.880]  of articles. I was there this morning looking at it where I would type in Donald Trump election
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.280]  rigged and it would say like 18,000 articles. Let's do it on Google right now for TV viewers.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.440]  I'll show people. And just click news. Type in Donald Trump may rig election. Now they're
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:11.040]  spending it that he said they will rig it so just give up. No, that's not what he said.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.760]  And he's afraid he's going to lose so they're doing this. No, he knows in their own internal
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:18.400]  polling with real polling companies, they want real numbers because they want to know
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.440]  where they're going. That he's seven to 10 to 12 to 14 points ahead. And when they scoop
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.760]  folks randomly off the street and do focus groups all over battleground states, minorities,
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:36.160]  you name it, most of them are actually for Trump. They know this. Okay, Trump knows.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.120]  And I'm going to stop right there and leave it at that. Okay, but I don't need to believe
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.320]  folks that have done focus groups and polls. I'm out there in the street. I'm up in some
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:49.640]  ivory tower at Martha's Vineyard drinking red wine and talking about how wonderful the
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:35:01.600]  world will be once it's depopulated. I'm actually researching what's going on. I tell you, it
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.040]  is a creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy feeling. You know, it's not like you're
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:11.920]  in college and you're writing your thesis paper or something. People get, you know,
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.560]  get nervous about that. Or you're in high school and finals, you're nervous about that.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.280]  Imagine writing articles, putting out stories and reports, and then they're the number one
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.440]  thing in the world. And people listen and foreign leaders listen. It's come out over
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.920]  and over again. And I should hear it so surreal. And it's not about Alex Jones or info wars.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.600]  It's about what are we saying that's so powerful? It's real analysis. It's classical Americana.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.160]  It's interviewing thousands and thousands of experts in every field to get a clear picture
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:46.480]  of not what the Soviet media is telling us. But what's really happening in the world and
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.960]  what's really happening is we have a global elite that controls the currency of the world
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.480]  that is bringing in a planetary tyrannical regime and abolishing borders to abolish the
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:00.640]  people's right to resist it. And this system creates poverty to financially control you.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:08.880]  And they've codified it into agenda 21 and into agenda 2030, which are official UN ratified
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.440]  treaties, not by us, but ratified globally. And we're under it. And you go read what they
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.320]  said they're going to do. They're doing all of it. Obama goes to Africa and says you can't
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:27.040]  have air conditioning or a car. That's what they mean. Folks, this is scientific evil
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:36.520]  developed by Prince Philip. And you better get a crash course in it. It claims it's liberal
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:42.360]  and loving and anti-racist because it is racist. When they got the documents six years ago
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:49.200]  from the Copenhagen UN Treaty, it turned out that it basically doubled taxes on the third
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:56.800]  world and many analysts said it would kill a billion people in 10 years. They've started
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.400]  the global culling. They've started the deindustrialization. They've started the shutdown. This is 21st
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:09.640]  century war. Our species isn't getting attacked by some outside aliens. It's being attacked
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:15.200]  by technocrats, elites that have set up a scientific plan to order the world and take
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.680]  it over and control it and in free will. I'm going back to Matt Bracken here in a moment.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:25.000]  Your phone calls at 800-25-99-231. But just look at the economic numbers. They're racing
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.960]  towards a global collapse. Many big European banks have lost half their values. CNN, the
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.120]  humbling of the American tech giants in China. Oh, we were supposed to always be the tech
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:38.920]  leaders. We were sold out. We were supposed to be serviced. That's being sold out. It's
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:48.600]  a plan to set us up and then dictate the terms of our surrender. That's Bloomberg. Global
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:55.680]  stocks drop. Yin strengthens as growth worries resurface. Japan, $276 billion stimulus plan,
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:05.360]  much smaller than it looks. This is just some of the news today. If I was a selfish person,
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:10.360]  I would be headed to the most rural area right now with my family and I'd just disappear
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:17.760]  right now. I'm telling you, folks, the world you've known is about to be gone. Get ready.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:23.520]  I don't know how the breaks are going to go. But let me tell you, the New World Order
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.080]  is even scared. When you look at them on TV, this is out of control like Bracken keeps
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.120]  saying. It's one thing to set up this plan for world government and have all your computers
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:41.520]  and your actuaries and your algorithms. It's another thing to actually get on the horse.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.200]  And let me tell you, we're all on the horse. I'm going to briefly say this and I'm done.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.280]  We're funded by you, not by big fat cash sponsors, not by stimulus money, not by taxpayer money
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.640]  like MSNBC and NPR and all the rest of them. We sell great nutraceuticals, great storable
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:01.440]  foods, great water filtration systems, great solar panel and control unit systems that
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.680]  are really the best units out there for the lowest price. We've got everything from vitamin
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:09.240]  mineral fusion to, you name it, brain force is a great natural, new tropic. Some of these
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.960]  ingredients are prescription in Europe. It's 40% off right now, 1776, and there's free
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.360]  shipping. We're going to get rid of a lot of the specials, but the three or four we
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.720]  kept, we're giving you free shipping on top of it, vitamin mineral fusion. We've also
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.800]  got specials on DNA force and the funds you send to us, well, you see what we do. We change
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:35.280]  the world. We go in when nobody else will. And we give a platform, told the other great
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.240]  patriots that want to fight in the information war and want to get everybody ready and geared
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.080]  up. InfowarsLifes.com, we go right to the nutraceuticals, we're called toll free,
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.360]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And I want to be very clear, this
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.240]  isn't rhetoric. Both my grandfathers from the Army Air Corps, almost a fighter pilot,
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:58.800]  almost a B17 pilot. And when they would say in the ads and newspapers and newsreels that
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.440]  men and women back at the factories making those planes and making those bombs and the
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.040]  people that delivered those bombs and the people that sat on those airfields and loaded
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.360]  those bombs were just as important as the people that flew in there and dropped those
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.720]  bombs. And you better believe this is a 21st century high tech war. And all of you funding
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.600]  us allow us to stand up against the enemy and their dirty tricks, everything else they
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.680]  do and to be strong in the face of this and to really be able to go to the next level.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:31.120]  And you have my commitment, whether we're able to go on six months or 10 years, I will
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.320]  continue to go on to the end, whatever happens, but I need metaphysically the fuel to fuel
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.240]  the planes and I need all of you to buy the products and to pray for us and to spread
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.360]  the word, 360 win to fight these people. And we need you to get the material and the articles
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:51.120]  of all these other great people that are already prominent, but many of which we're trying
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:56.680]  to elevate so that there's more people and quite frankly, a bigger officer class in this
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.600]  organic resistance to the new world order. If they wipe out people like Donald Trump
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.160]  or Matt Drudge or myself or others, because it's a really weird feeling not be worried
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.960]  about yourself, but being guilty if they kill you that you can't keep fighting. And we're
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.960]  here folks. This is real. This is history. They don't want you to be real. They don't
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.840]  want you to believe their self. There is Matt Bracken. I want to take calls, but I want
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.080]  to give you the floor about the latest Islamic attacks, the changing the name from Ali to
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.960]  David, not saying it's Islamic when they cut the priest's head off. Just massive censorship
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:34.040]  intensifying. I mean, this is really, really crazy. And then putting the Islamists in the
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.600]  positions of power to rule over us. I mean, it's really happening.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:45.560]  Hope. Even the Pope. Yes. You know, Pope Francis. You have to remember Pope Benedict
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:51.560]  did not die in office. He was not ruled incompetent or something like that. It was a coup. It
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:57.680]  was a coup of the social justice warrior, Marxist priest class that took him that took Benedict
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:03.920]  out and put a lackey in a Marxist lackey. That's the guy that just said that there is
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.440]  no Islamic terror and it's blasphemy to say it. We must open our borders. It's so unthinkable.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.680]  It was dissociated press. I can't even believe he said it. Go ahead. Sorry. And how can anybody
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:19.720]  look at something like that and not see it as, you know, one more clang, you clanging
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.480]  bell alarm? Does this not signify they're going for broke? As you said, this signifies
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:29.880]  the road. Even to take out the Pope and put in a Marxist, you know, a Marxist stooge
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:35.680]  at best and a, you know, willing participant at worst. And I want to say something about
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:41.760]  the media. I got to go back to the, uh, the, the Soviet and a media. I can't, it, it blows
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:47.200]  my mind even more than say this full court press, but with Khan, who got what, 50 times
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.680]  more coverage than the, than the Benghazi families in three days than they got in year
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:58.880]  in, in since Benghazi. They've been dehumanized. But the, the wiki leaks, which they turned
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:07.320]  into a, a, uh, uh, Russia and Trump attack perfectly, the wiki leaks shows that Politico,
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:15.040]  the Washington post, um, you name brand big top big shots like Chuck Todd and Jake Tapper,
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.880]  they're taking their instructions from the DNC. It's like going back to George Stephanopoulos
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.520]  in the, uh, in the, um, uh, Romney first debate, when he brought up birth control, that was
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:31.600]  a talking point that he was assigned. He's a DNC agent. He used to run the, uh, the
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.520]  Clinton war room in the first Clinton administration.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:39.200]  They've got their people everywhere. Right. Wolf Blitzer dancing and drinking champagne. Whoops.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:45.520]  Am I on camera? So the fact that, that these guys like Chuck Todd and Jake Tapper can still
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.520]  go on television and not have people out on the street when they have those, you know,
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:54.520]  glass wall studios, you know, throwing paint at the window or something. It's a joke. This
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:44:01.560]  is like the Soviet Union. Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd, Wolf Blitzer, Washington post Politico.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.760]  These guys are named. They're cooperating. The emails show. Well, well, do you want us
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.760]  to scratch any of those questions out or you can get pre-approval, but if these questions
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:17.400]  aren't suitable, just give us the questions you want. Come on, America. This is a joke.
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:23.320]  The FBI is sold out. The Pope is a stooge. A Marxist stooge. The media is completely
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:31.400]  on board with this. What is it going to take to wake this country up? A super 9-11? Of
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.760]  course, if that happens, that'll be used as an excuse to abolish the Internet or take
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:43.240]  it down for a while and tame it. But everybody needs to know this can turn very quickly.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.440]  This is like the moment where the cold water turns to ice in a hurry. You know, you went
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:53.720]  to bed, it was water. You wake up, it's ice. Every morning when I turn on the TV, I'm wondering
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.920]  when is it going to be the day that we see an aircraft carrier on fire in the Persian
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:04.360]  Gulf? You know, something on that level, a bank crisis in Germany and runs on banks.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.400]  Something huge is going to happen. We can all feel it. We don't know what it's going
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:15.120]  to be, but we all feel it. We can all tell. This is like May of 1914 in Europe with trains
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.080]  going in all directions, full of troops and artillery. We don't know where it's going
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:23.400]  to happen, but it's about to happen. It's definitely about to happen.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:28.840]  It's about to happen. And I can just feel the energy level. I can see it. And I see
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:34.360]  Donald Trump, who I was holding my nose about supporting Iran and Africa because they were
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.400]  attacking him. He was a nationalist. He had some liberal background I didn't like. But
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.320]  I tell you, getting to really know the real Donald Trump and seeing what's happened, he's
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:49.400]  got a lot of courage. At least he's a fighter. At least he's a fighter. Sometimes you just
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:55.480]  need a scrapper. You know, we don't have any more use for these Marquita Queensbury, uh,
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.840]  you know, ballet dancer, pugilist. I was about to say, but he knows the stakes and he's
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:05.720]  street fighters. We need a street fighter now. We've had enough of these of these Marquita
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.160]  Queensbury sissies that prance around the ring. But as soon as somebody touches their
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.000]  jaw, you know, they go flying over the, uh, you know, they go flying out of the ring.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.040]  I mean, we need a fighter. Now he's unkempt. He's uncouth. Yeah. He says a lot of the
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:27.000]  wrong things. They laid a, they laid a brown paper bag full of poop in front of his door
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  and they lit it on fire.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.680]  He's got guts and guts is enough. And he's our champion and we're going with him.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:41.000]  And the thing that's got the globalists in mortal panic is that a year from now, if there's
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.920]  a attorney general, uh, Andrew McCarthy, uh, you know, Giuliani, these kind of people,
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.640]  Democrats are going to prison for treason and for espionage, prison, hard prison, you
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.280]  know, the, the statute of limitations on what Hillary did with the server is seven years.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:05.240]  What do you expect me to bring this up? If Hillary gets in, what do you expect?
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:09.040]  I expect that they're going to try very hard to crack down on the internet and on free
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:15.960]  speech. She's already a strong supporter of this UN resolution, 16, 18, which basically
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:21.040]  institutes global blasphemy laws that would be ahead of our constitution and the mainstream
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:24.840]  media is getting its butt handed to it by the new media. And so they're going to be
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.000]  more than happy to go along with this. We already see, uh, the censorship intensifying.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  They have to, and we're very lucky that we have Europe to look at so we can look at Europe
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.800]  where they have no first command and they're arresting Germans that are protesting about
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.520]  their own invasion. I mean, imagine it's, you know, your country's being invaded in
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:49.760]  a hostile, you know, with the quizzlings opening the gate for the jihadists and the people
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.880]  that are complaining about it get arrested. So we're very fortunate that we have a worst
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.960]  case scenario unfolding in Europe right before our eyes.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.160]  I tell you, and we have a first amendment. Let's go to phone calls. Matt Bracken's our
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:08.400]  guest, John George, Kevin Mark and many others. Uh, let's go ahead and go to George in Connecticut.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:14.000]  We're on the air with Matt Bracken. Hi guys. I just came up with the two, uh, thing, two
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.240]  issues that I'd like you guys to comment on. Uh, you, we know that he, uh, just, uh, I
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.800]  was watching CNN and watching the whole thing on the TPP thing that Obama was talking about.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.880]  That's the one issue, but the second issue I'll get it later. Uh, he was saying that
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:32.840]  he's unfit for office, but he didn't seem to be went, went down a list of why it was
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:37.680]  for the TPP. And he was going down a list and the one thing he mentioned that he had
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:44.040]  to have trafficking in, in the particular TPP trafficking is slavery. So he's saying
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:51.600]  that, that, uh, Trump is unfit, but he's saying slavery is good. Is that unfit? Well, how
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:56.040]  about having foreign multinational secret groups running our country's decisions? That's
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:04.680]  unfit. Absolutely. Uh, Matt. Well, it's, it's almost beyond belief, but right now the Department
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:11.680]  of Homeland Security is being run by the Muslim brotherhood. Obama put in these, these, uh,
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.920]  care and, and, uh, you know, uh, other groups to be the, to run interference against the
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:23.480]  FBI for the jihadists. So we, you know, it, nothing would surprise me that the first Clinton
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:29.200]  regime, they, they threw morale for money. They gave the, you know, the intercontinental
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.960]  ballistic missile technology to China on a platter. They invited the Chinese scientists
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:39.080]  into, into Los Alamos and everywhere else. They even took away the, uh, colored badges
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.120]  that they could tell like who's foreign, who's American, who has a clearance because it was
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.160]  bad. And then they have our news and movies announced. We got our rocket technology from
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:52.960]  China. They invert everything. Right. And, and so there's massive treason that's gone
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:58.880]  on. Now in a Democrat welfare state, maybe it won't matter. Like I said, Hillary could,
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.480]  you know, eat a baby on television and it wouldn't matter because the people who are
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.000]  welfare slaves, the welfare slaves on the EBT plantation, all they care about is that
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.520]  every two weeks, their EBT card gets recharged with cash, with electronic cash. And otherwise
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:20.520]  they really don't care. This is why they're bringing in all the illegal aliens. They're
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.680]  even flying them in from Guatemala and Honduras because it's too dangerous for them to make
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.560]  the trip. We'll send an airplane and then your parents can come next year. Well, they
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:33.960]  have the Supreme Court rules that's illegal, but they just go ahead and go forward with
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:37.240]  it. They don't care. George, what was the other question?
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:42.920]  So the question, uh, question, I just want you to realize that he's been selling, uh,
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:49.160]  visas and, and, and the citizenship to, uh, foreigners, Muslim foreigners in particular,
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:54.800]  because he's also a lawyer for Sharia law. So he wants to bring in Muslims. He's selling
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.720]  them. I forgot the name of the visa. No, I'm aware of it. Thank you. We're probably come
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:02.360]  back. George. Thank you. Then Charles, John, Kevin, Mark and others. Are you worried about
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.200]  how dangerous the world has become in these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters,
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:11.320]  or even a future collapse? You need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.

[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:10.840]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:15.560]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:21.200]  generators really do provide life saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:26.200]  run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:31.040]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:34.400]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:39.800]  this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:44.280]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.560]  to the low price for infill wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:54.560]  gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.840]  with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:06.040]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean smooth shave from a quality

[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.280]  We're back live from Matt Bracken's our guest five minutes to the next hour with me. Another
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:29.320]  guest popping in to talk about her history with the Clintons. You hide behind discs.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:35.600]  The whole Republican establishment is against Trump. Which just shows how criminal all of
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:41.120]  this has really gotten. And the whole stage is set for any type of tourney you can imagine
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:47.320]  with the media that will just lie about anything. I'm really surprised at how corrupt. The average
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:51.600]  person is that last caller George. He had one other question. You want to respond to
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:55.680]  what he was saying Matt Bracken.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.720]  We're talking. There was a TTP or no he was one day con in the Muslim Brotherhood. Yes
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:07.200]  about Obama selling Jesus. Yeah that's called civilizational Jihad.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:11.960]  People need to read this book. It's not a thick book. You know it's it's only a couple
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:18.080]  hundred pages. If that. See something say nothing by Phil Haney. If you don't have time
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.920]  for books go on YouTube and just look at the Senate Senate hearing testimony in the middle
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.880]  of June. The country has been sold out. The traders have taken over basically. The most
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:36.840]  shameful thing and sad for me is to watch the FBI take a dive on this. Like Hoover ordering
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:43.080]  the Hoover and Jad FDR ordering the FBI to not talk about Germans in the 1930s and the
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:50.000]  FBI saying fine. No more German investigations. It's just very disheartening. It's incredible.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.200]  We expect the media to be prostitutes, prostitutes. You know you don't expect much from the media.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:59.880]  They just are our attention whores with million dollar salaries. I think it's just to become
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.480]  the cowardice because people don't realize what comes next. The total tyranny. John and
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.800]  Wyoming are on the air. Go ahead. Thanks for calling.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.960]  Yeah Alex you've got a great guest again as usual. Way to go Matt. You're right on a couple
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:18.560]  of issues. Number one on these phony pollsters. Remember in 1984 these same crooked pollsters
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:23.960]  said that Mondale and Ferrero were going to steamroll over Reagan and Bush. Yet when the
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:31.040]  voting had been done Reagan and Bush picked up 525 electoral college votes while Mondale
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:38.680]  and Ferrero picked up 13. It was the biggest drubbing since FDR defeated Alph Landon in
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:45.760]  1936. Also I heard on mainstream media yesterday that one of the major banks in Italy is being
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:54.440]  bailed out to the tune of 5 billion euros. So the collapse is not too far down the road.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:59.880]  Yes that's true. But the problem is they've now put in their special black box systems
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:07.560]  Mr. Bracken. Yeah I think that unless it's really a landslide like a 1980 landslide my
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:14.360]  first presidential vote cast was for Ronald Reagan. And like the caller said we didn't
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.780]  know because it was neck and neck. We didn't know and then it turned out to be a blowout.
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:24.440]  I know that a lot of I don't see bumper stickers at all none for Hillary of course but I don't
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:29.080]  see them for Trump either. I think people are afraid of getting their car vandalized.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.080]  That's the state of this country now. But it could be a blowout but unless it's a blowout
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:40.160]  they'll cheat and win. But I don't think that they'll allow even a blowout to go forward.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:46.340]  For example if their secret internal polling shows a solid Trump lead going into the elections
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:52.600]  I think they'll do some other form of a destabilization just to prevent the elections. Something like
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.680]  a campaign of snipers. That's right. I mean they've got Obama on TV saying
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.880]  you cannot have Trump. They look scared. I mean they're going to pull in. I think Trump's
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:05.720]  10 15 points ahead. Yeah and I think that no matter what they're
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:12.120]  not going to let him be inaugurated and then let you know of Attorney General Giuliani
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:19.320]  put them in prison for espionage and treason. Well the larger issue is we're fighting back
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:24.520]  so we're exposing their program. We're not just going along quietly now. And so their
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:27.600]  arrogance has been handed to them over and over again. Look at the superdelegates with
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.960]  Trump so it's an exciting going to be alive. John thank you so much great points. All right
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:37.800]  to Kevin and others your calls are just 70 seconds away as we start the third hour. I'm
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:46.880]  Alex Jones. Paul Watson joining us from the fourth hour. This is GCN the Genesis Communications
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:55.240]  Radio Network. More than two years ago Info Wars first told you about our research into
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:59.440]  what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:05.080]  for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:09.960]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:15.120]  the water. They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:20.280]  crisis worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:26.480]  for your family. Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:32.600]  between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.760]  ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:41.640]  deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:53.840]  regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:59:53.840 --> 02:00:12.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:19.800]  Before America can be great again she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:28.680]  Jones Show. 10 years ago almost no one knew the Federal Reserve was private. Didn't want
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:31.400]  to talk about world government. Now it's all mainstream news. The Pope has to say it's
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:36.200]  a good thing. It only begun to fight. So we're talking about some scary things here but this
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:43.400]  is not negative. It's positive to know the truth. It's positive to understand what's
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:49.200]  happening and to know that this is the animating contest that will test our metal. Right now
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.080]  let's go to Kevin in Florida. Kevin you're only here with Matt Bracken and Alex Jones.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:54.080]  Go ahead.
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:58.720]  Thank you so much Alex fellow conspiracy theorist here. I just thought a quick point that I'll
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:04.840]  get to my question. I wanted to ask Matt what he thought about the government successful
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:11.440]  plan to get everybody to identify with the race and everybody to get to identify with
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.880]  the current groups. If you're black you have to be a Democrat and think the man's against
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:20.560]  you and everybody's racist. If you're white you got to tower in the corner and fear and
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:26.640]  think that your white privilege got you everything. And this leads us to if the globalists are
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.960]  successful in stealing this election which many people think do you think there's going
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:38.000]  to be this big civil unrest for like-minded individuals like myself and fellow Infra-Warriors
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.400]  that aren't going to stand utterly by and let this happen.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:51.480]  They should plan this racializing the politics in this country. I was in the military and
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:57.080]  everybody in the military you kind of get an attitude that we're green. You know we're
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:06.680]  all green. So it's if people that were never in the military never saw a really desegregated
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:12.920]  society like the military is at its best. If the power goes out and there's massive
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:17.960]  looting then I think that it's going to be very hard to not have a racial aspect to the
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:23.000]  civil breakdown unfortunately. I think that we do need to stand on the Constitution. You
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  know the Constitution is what unites us. We don't take an oath to the leader or the
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:34.480]  patria. We take an oath to the Constitution and the Constitution is not a racial document.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.840]  Anybody that's a race hustler, anybody that's you know spreading racial dissension should
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.840]  really be seen as un-American. And let's be clear. The globalists have
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:52.600]  it in the cards to use a civil breakdown, a societal collapse to bring in control. And
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.160]  so clearly that's why they've invoked all this race so we don't organize together against
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:01.080]  the globalist during a collapse which shows us they're really thinking about going to
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:06.560]  this next level. There's a fabulous book out. The author's
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:15.800]  name is Larson and it's in the Garden of Beasts. And it's about the notification of Germany
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:22.720]  from during the 30s. It's written by the from the letters of Ambassador who was sent over
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:29.520]  there and his daughter watching the internal Berlin political machinations. And it's really
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:35.240]  amazing to see a lot of the parallels, the media being co-opted, you know, the enemies
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.400]  of the state being kicked out of their jobs, the Jews, etc.
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:46.200]  Oh, it's a definite totalitarian takeover. But there's the thing. Every takeover before
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:52.960]  all the average people had to go on was the mainstream media. You know, the big newspapers
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.720]  basically could get us in and out of wars just by cooperating with the powers, you know,
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:02.480]  the powers that be in the White House, the Spanish American war, what do they, you know,
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.840]  they said you provide the, what is it? I'll provide the war. You provide the paintings,
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.160]  the illustrations, I'll supply the war. That was William Randolph Hearst.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.640]  Right. And the difference is, and this is the real fly in the globalist ointment, we
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.640]  have our own weapons now right here. We're very powerful. Social media is power. And
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.560]  now, of course, 80% of the people unfortunately might be watching the Kardashians and they
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:32.560]  wake up wondering who the bachelorette is going to choose. And for those people, there's
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.160]  almost no hope. They're just going to be shocked and amazed when the TV goes black and the
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.640]  water tap is dry. They're not going to know what hit them. But for everybody else, at
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:46.080]  least we can prepare. You know, we know that the, where the train is going out of control
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:49.280]  down the track. Exactly. Matt Bracken, always great having you on.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:52.240]  Thank you. EnemiesFarmingDomestic.com. We're going to come back with another guest, more
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:56.240]  calls and a ton of news. Paul Watson, come up as well. Thank you, Matt Bracken. Bottom
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:01.600]  line, use the internet while we've still got it. These information warfare weapons are
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:06.280]  important. The Islamic State is specifically targeting the U.S. Army, putting out a list
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:12.200]  of 700 soldiers the terror army wants to kill, reports The Washington Times. United Cyber
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:17.080]  Caliphate, the Islamic State's three month old hacking consortium, has posted a number
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:22.680]  of such lists. Analysts say most names appear to be publicly available and randomly chosen
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:28.400]  as opposed to the UCC actually hacking into a website and stealing the information. In
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:34.360]  the July 25th posting by the Islamic State, a Pentagon official told the Washington Times,
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:39.040]  analysts have not yet found an open source for the army kill list. The possibility is
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:44.200]  that one or more government sites were hacked. The source said the Islamic State's U.S. Army
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:50.040]  list begins with the headline. We want them hashtag dead. Hashtag revenge for Muslims.
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:06:02.000]  Call the dogs. You can find more reports on info wars.com over the years, there have been

[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:12.800]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence,
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:18.920]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. In Dallas, Texas, three
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:24.920]  shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. The first reports say
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:31.920]  that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. It is a big idea.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:44.920]  A new world order. It was almost as if we were planned in force. It's just pancake. Either
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:09:04.920]  you were with the terrorists. I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:16.360]  and soldiers are not the hands of criminals. For many of the police and guard troops, it
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:21.440]  is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city. Global governance at last. Is it one
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:26.200]  world the central bank is in charge? But aren't we all just living and dying from what the
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:33.640]  central banks do? And for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:46.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. I'm going to continue with your
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:53.080]  phone calls in this hour. With us for the next 30 minutes is Dolly Kyle. Heard a lot
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:57.160]  about her over the years. Childhood friend of Bill Clinton and then knew them right through
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:06.040]  until they became high-powered folks in politics. She graduated from SMU School of Law in Dallas.
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:09.600]  She practiced the real estate law in Texas and founded lawyers for affordable housing
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:14.920]  that provided pro-bono legal service for low-income homeowners and non-profit housing groups like
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:19.340]  Habitat for Humanity. She met former President Clinton on a hot springs golf course later
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:25.160]  when she was 11 and was almost 13. Her friendship grew through high school and college and became
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:29.840]  a decades-long affair that lasted despite marriages and politics all the way to the
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:35.120]  threshold of the White House when she became a political liability. And he threatened to
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:40.920]  destroy her as Hillary had done to so many of his other women over the years. Hillary,
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:46.360]  the other woman, pulls no punches in describing the way media magic makes Clinton stories
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:52.240]  disappear. And the new book is from WNDBooks.com and Amazon.com. You can find it. Hillary, the
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:58.880]  other woman, a political memoir. What a lot of courage to say the least she has to go
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.880]  public. There are a lot of other women with documentation going public. People have been
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:08.480]  killed. They've been tortured. They've had their homes taken by these monsters. And to
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:14.760]  see them claim that they represent women in this gimmick that, you know, let's play
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:19.600]  the female card. I would vote for a woman for president in one second if they were a
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:24.120]  patriot. In fact, I think this is just like Obama, the supposed first black president
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:27.320]  and doing all these horrible things was very discrediting. It was done on purpose. They
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:34.040]  created great division when they promised unity. Salt was placed in the moon and then
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:38.600]  ground in with great fervor. Same thing is going to happen with the so-called glass ceiling,
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:42.680]  but Dolly Kyle is our guest. We're going to write back to your calls and all the other
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:48.080]  big news. What's exciting is that Trump knows they try to steal the primary from him, and
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:52.480]  he fought back and they had to back off. He's doing the same thing with Hillary, and the
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:56.240]  media is freaking out, but he promises to, quote, punch through the media. We're going
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:01.280]  to be getting to that coming up as well. But Dolly Kyle, thank you so much for joining
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.280]  us.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:06.920]  Well, you're welcome. I'm happy to be here finally after we sort of played phone tags
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:09.000]  for a couple of weeks.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.240]  It's really good to have you here. Let's go back. Why you decided to go public? What
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.840]  it's been like? The threats. People need to read this book. People need to know who the
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:21.120]  real William Jefferson Clinton is, who the real Hillary Rodham Clinton are, obviously.
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:28.360]  Well, you made it sound so good. I want to reread it. Thank you for the nice introduction.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:35.040]  Why now? I did not want to write this book, Alex. I'm a novelist, and I wrote a lot of
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:41.360]  this story about Billy and Hillary and our relationship in loosely autobiographical fiction,
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:47.040]  and that's really what I wanted to do. But I will tell you what kept it. Last December,
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.360]  I was watching a prerecorded television show skimming through the commercials, and I saw
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.520]  Hillary, so I backed up and listened to it, and I saw the now famous clip where she said
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.280]  something like, women who say they've been raped and sexually assaulted should be believed.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:08.040]  We deserve to believe them. And it went all over me. I mean, it just went all over me
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:14.560]  because this hypocritical liar is looking in the camera with as much sincerity as she
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:19.280]  can muster and trying to pretend that she's supporting women when she has been attacking
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:28.360]  Billy's friends, girlfriends, rapies, assault victims since 1974 that I know of. And it
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:34.920]  just made me sick. So the next day I sat down and started writing the book.
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.480]  And now it's not a novel. There's a lot of folks put reality into novels to protect the
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:45.800]  innocent themselves. Now it is nonfiction. Hillary, the other woman, a political memoir.
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.720]  Obviously, folks need to read the book, but give us the key points of who Bill Clinton
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:54.280]  really is and who Hillary really is.
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:14:02.200]  In a nutshell, these are two very thick, untreated, addicted people. Hillary is addicted to power
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:08.960]  and money and then more money so she can get more power. Billy is clearly addicted to sex.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:15.960]  And I talk about this in the book, but obviously we can't cover 292 pages in 20 minutes. So
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:21.400]  there is that. And then at the end of the book, well, you mentioned media magic, but
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:28.240]  chapter 47 is media magic, how to make a story disappear. And it tells from my own personal
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.920]  perspective, back in the 90s, when I ended up filing a lawsuit against Billy Clinton,
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:40.120]  who was the sitting president at the time, and probably no one ever heard of that because
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:45.360]  NBC, for example, didn't think it was news that someone was suing the president of the
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:50.720]  United States, nor that the issue of whether he could be sued in office when it went to
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:57.400]  the United States Supreme Court and I won was even newsworthy then. So this is the way
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:03.560]  it happened. And it's very hard for people who have lived, let's call it normal lives
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.160]  to believe what is going on behind the scenes. I'm not sure I would believe it if I just
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.840]  heard it from someone. Obviously, I'm going to read the book myself, but give us a gestalt
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.520]  when you talk about her power, hungriness, his, his, I mean, reportedly he wants like
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.560]  10 women a day. Well, I don't know. I guess it depends on what day it is and what he did
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:29.880]  the day before. I'm not sure. But the bottom line is that these people will stop at nothing
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:36.200]  to get back into the White House and that when they were in there, you know, one of
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:41.640]  the first things that Hillary did was to have Craig Livingstone, who was the security director
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:46.680]  in the White House. And by the way, his background for that was as a bar bouncer and he couldn't
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:54.080]  even get security clearance. But what he could do was grab 900 FBI files and the media sort
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.040]  of poo pooed that and called it file gate. And I don't think people have thought through
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:05.440]  how critically important that is because when it came time for Billy's impeachment,
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.280]  there weren't just 900 people in Washington terrified that the Clintons had their files.
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:15.520]  There were thousands because they didn't post the list and say, okay, we have senators so
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:21.240]  and so and representative such and such and judge whoever. No one knew how many they had.
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:26.640]  And so everyone was afraid to talk. This is why I put my dirty laundry in the book. There's
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:32.400]  nothing they can blackmail me with. The book is not fallacious. It's not full of sex details
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.800]  or anything like that because that's not relevant to the story. However, since I am
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:41.480]  getting a little bit tired of people calling me a liar, I will say people can go online
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:49.520]  if they're interested. And they can Google Dolly Kyle Jones versus Clinton lawsuit deposition.
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:56.760]  You can see Billy's own lawyer asking me under oath confirming that I had a decades long relationship
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:03.960]  with Billy Clinton that was consensual. And Billy denied anything about me under oath except
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.760]  he tried to be nice to me in high school. But there are also handwritten letters from
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:14.360]  Billy to me that are appended to that deposition. So there I hope that we know they always attack
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:18.120]  the women. But it's I mean, Bill Clinton is well known with his exploits, settling at least one
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:23.480]  rape lawsuit. What do you think? Get into what you know about the rape. Why need a broad
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.760]  rig did not sue him and did not file criminal charges. If she had filed criminal charges,
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:33.560]  she could have filed a criminal charge against Hillary as an accessory after the fact because
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:39.240]  Hillary threatened her to keep her mouth shut after Billy raped her in 1978 when he was attorney
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:47.640]  general and running for governor. In chapter 50, I talk about the 17 truth suppression techniques
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:52.200]  that the Clintons use and I did borrow these with permission from Dave Martin, DC Dave.
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:59.480]  And the other thing is that I believe a serious problem politics aside is the fact that Hillary
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:05.880]  is showing signs of increasing cognitive impairment. And after one radio show, someone I knew sent me
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:10.840]  an email and said, what's cognitive impairment? And so for those who don't know, it's kind of
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:16.120]  like when you're losing it, you know, he acts like a homeless person on the side of the road
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:22.920]  a lot of the time. Yeah. And in chapter 50, I go through some of the symptoms of cognitive
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:28.520]  impairment that are listed on the Center for Disease Controls website. Anyone can go there and
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:34.200]  look and then look at her behaviors. One of the things is loss of memory. Now this puts Hillary
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:40.920]  in an interesting position. Is she losing her memory because of this cognitive impairment?
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:48.200]  Or did she say under oath 250 times? I don't remember because she was lying. So we have
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:52.840]  a choice. She can flip coin. She was either lying or she's cognitively impaired. I mean,
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:59.160]  we know she's a bad actress. All that weird stuff at the DMC look like John Wayne Gacy or
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:04.040]  something hopping around the stage, spatting at balloons. Doesn't Bill look bad? I mean,
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:08.200]  just talking about how he looks all shaking. He looks like an undertaker or something from a
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:15.400]  harm. Yeah. And speaking of undertakers, this is sad to say, but when you're approaching 70 as we
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:20.600]  are, a lot of times you just see your friends at funerals. And I've seen him two or three times
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:27.480]  in the last year at funerals of mutual friends. And each time the guy in the casket has looked
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:33.240]  better than Billy. What's the word on him? Parkinson's? What's going on? Yeah. Well,
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:37.160]  I don't know. I've heard the same things you've heard. I've observed the same things you've
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:41.720]  observed, but I have no inside information on that. Sure. Talking about Hillary though,
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:45.480]  and her, her, her, I mean, look, we'll get a Hillary in a minute in her power trip, but, but
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:50.520]  sexually, um, I mean, these women have all basically said the same things before it was ever on the
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:57.320]  news about, uh, Bill and just crooked in one way and, uh, his pension to beat women up, to buy them
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:03.000]  and stuff. Did he ever do any of that to you? Um, our relationship was purely consensual. And
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:08.280]  you remember, I met him when I was 11. He was 12 going on 13. We were friends. We were friends. We
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:17.880]  dated in high school. We had what I would call a very normal relationship for a while, but he
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:24.280]  never, it was never harassment. It was never assault. It was always consensual, but I will say
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:30.520]  this. I did not know about his rape and sexual assault. So would you say he's a pretty nice guy
[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:36.200]  then? I mean, yeah. Yeah. I mean, and, and everyone we went to high school with, I mean,
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:41.480]  I think everyone generally liked Billy. He did lose the election for senior class secretary
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:44.360]  to his next-door neighbor, Carolyn Yale. Sure. From everybody I've talked to though,
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:48.920]  and of course this has been documented, but would you concur that Hillary pretty much wears the
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:53.800]  pants and was kind of his enabler and would cover up from him and was kind of his beard
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:21:00.760]  for his sexual exploits? Uh, that's, that's a little bit, uh, more exaggerated than I would
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:04.120]  say it in more general, but I can't really argue with that. I'll go, I'll go with that.
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:08.600]  So she wasn't just co-president then? Was she like 60, 40, or I mean, how would you estimate that?
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:14.280]  Oh, no, I would not estimate that. I think a lot of times Billy humored her,
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.200]  by letting her do things and it was always things he didn't want to do. The one thing
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:26.680]  about Hillary is that she is a very hard worker and, and she's a fighter and, you know, that's,
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:31.000]  I guess you could call positive things unless of course you're on the receiving end of that and
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:37.400]  she's working hard to destroy you and fighting against you. So I, uh, I'm not entirely thrilled
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:44.120]  with those, uh, those adjectives, but here's the other thing. Um, right now in the Clinton
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:49.640]  truth suppression techniques, they're on number one with me and I love that. It's my very favorite
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:55.480]  because number one is to ignore me. And so I'm getting very little media coverage, very little
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:00.440]  anything. I've had a running battle with Amazon because they keep saying my book is out of stock
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:05.880]  or it's going to be shipped in two months or, you know, I got, I went to number one on Amazon
[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:09.720]  two months ago, still didn't get a number one sticker. Sure. I mean, the fix is in. They want
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:14.120]  him to list Donald Trump as a political candidate on Google. So the answer is go to WND.com,
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:18.120]  get the book directly from world net daily. There you go. Yeah, I would never even mention
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:21.800]  Amazon. I would say don't get it from Amazon. Even though you made it number one, I would just say,
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:26.200]  I just say go to world net daily and understand and that's true. The thing of it is Amazon is the
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:31.480]  600 pound gorilla and the 600 pound gorilla is one that does the accounting. Oh, I know all about
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:35.800]  them. I know all about them. Yeah, we, we, you know, I'm over that. It's more important to talk
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:41.400]  to people like you and wait, wait a minute. I'm sorry. Back up. Nobody liked you, Alex, but
[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:46.360]  to talk to people on the radio and spread the word to those people who probably would never
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:53.240]  buy a book anyway. But we need to, we need to get the word out that Hillary is an other woman.
[02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:59.320]  And it's a play on words because when I met her 15 years into knowing Billy, she was, if you will,
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:04.280]  the other woman. And then the flip side of that is, and why we have her facing away from the camera
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:10.760]  on the cover of the book, she is not the woman she would like you to think she is. She is an
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:15.000]  other woman. Now let's talk about that. Who is Hillary Clinton from, from you knowing her so
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.040]  long? And I mean, she knew you were with Bill sometimes. I mean, how was her attitude about
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:23.240]  that where it was a laissez-faire? Well, she didn't really care what he did as long as he
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:30.120]  didn't get caught in a way that would jeopardize her political career because she remember was
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:36.440]  riding his coattails from the time she spotted him at Yale Law School and invited him to come
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:41.880]  and live with her, which Billy, I'm sorry to say, is, has always been something of a moocher.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:46.120]  So, I mean, he told me in 1972 he was moving in with this law student and it was really
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:50.760]  no big deal. And really, it never was any big deal between us.
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:54.840]  What about the word that she's really Webster Hubble's daughter? She sure looks like him.
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:03.080]  Yeah, I, that's in my book. What I, Robert Morrow, who wrote with my other friend, Roger Stone,
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:08.600]  the book Clinton's War on Woman, that women, they, they completely believe that Web Hubble is
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:13.640]  Chelsea's father. I don't, I don't think so. And I, and I say my reasons in the book, but
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:18.360]  we agreed to disagree on that a long time ago until there's a definitive DNA test. I don't know.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:24.440]  But if you're just looking at the big lip, go back and, and Google a picture of Dorothy Rodham,
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:29.480]  Hillary's mother, when she was Chelsea's age, Chelsea's a spitting image of her. And you'll
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:35.080]  look at a picture of Virginia Clinton when she was a young woman. She looked a lot like her.
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:39.480]  And she got the big lower lip too. So, of course, you think Bill, did Bill ever tell you anything
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:45.320]  about his mama? Is it was reported she was a lady of the night for the mafia? Well, I knew
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:50.840]  Virginia. I mean, you got to remember, we grew up in hot springs. Our families were friends
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:55.000]  for years. Billy's Uncle Raymond. But for those that don't know, that's, I mean,
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:03.480]  that was still a big mafia party town then though. Well, yes, it was. But Virginia was
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:10.280]  an RN and she was a nurse anesthetist. She was on call 24 seven for one period of about three years
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:18.600]  straight. And so she was always out and about. And, and I know that she had lots of affairs. And
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:26.760]  you know, I mentioned Virginia in the book because she's not, she's just not the totally innocent
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:32.200]  party girl. And then I also talked about in the book where people say, well, a lot of guys,
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:36.920]  you know, quote, married a mother, unquote, and they couldn't see a connection between
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:42.040]  Hillary, who is nothing like Virginia. And you know, why, what did Billy see in her? And I talk
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:48.360]  about that in the book and go back to the fact that Hillary is his mean controlling grandmother
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:53.080]  who raised him for the first four years. I was a psych major before I went to law school.
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:58.760]  I understand. Let's expand on this. Let's expand on this. The word is, I think it was Clinton said
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:02.760]  it that Hillary seemed more tail than a toilet seat or a bicycle seat. Is it, I mean, you know,
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:09.480]  Hillary's, you ever seen any of her activity towards women? No. And as I always say, I've
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:16.120]  heard the same things you've heard, but she never propositioned to me. But I will say that in an
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:21.560]  interesting little incident that happened at the governor's mansion one night when I was with Billy.
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:27.800]  And I think I put this in the book too. But Billy said to me in a very intimate moment,
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:34.360]  I want to have a baby. And I was a little taken aback since we were both married to other people.
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:39.400]  And I said, do you think that's a good idea? And he looked at me sort of strangely. And then he
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:49.880]  kind of chuckled me. He said, Oh, I didn't mean with you. So, uh, yeah. Yeah. So what are you
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:54.680]  talking about? You don't have time to have a baby. You both of you are just crazy going in every
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:27:02.040]  direction. He said, we need to have a baby so that we will look like a normal couple. And we need
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:07.880]  to take away attention from the warden's lifestyle. He called her the warden. I was about to say,
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:12.840]  it's been reported they aborted a boy. And I guess they thought it'd be better for local persons
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:20.200]  to have a girl. Did you have no idea? No idea about that. And, and I also heard that Jennifer
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:25.640]  Flowers had an abortion of a baby with him. I have no, I don't know any more than you know.
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.800]  All right. Well, listen, I'm going to read the book and I want to have you back up before the
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:34.680]  election, obviously for a full hour to come down to Austin and do it in studio. Cause that's always
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:40.200]  more fun. Let Nico, uh, Acosta know anytime you want to come down here. In fact, we'll fly you
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:43.720]  down here if you want to come down, have you in studio, but you know, hotel, uh, and I would love
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:47.960]  to do that. And then maybe fly Roger Stoneman or have him on as a guest while you're on because
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:51.320]  he's an expert on this too. But in the two minutes we've got left, folks are going to get the book,
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:55.240]  but give us other tidbits about why you went public, why you're concerned, what you think
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:00.600]  Hillary will do once she's all president of that happens. I can't even think about that, Alex,
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:05.080]  without getting depressed or throwing up. So I'm not going to speculate on what happens if she's
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:11.560]  president. I'm going to say this. I have children. I have grandchildren and I love my country. I still
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:18.120]  get goosebumps when we do the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and seeing the Star Spangled Banner.
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:26.120]  I love my country. Hillary hates America, hates Americans, hates everyone. Turn off the sound
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:31.160]  sometime when you're looking at a video her and see the hate coming out of her eyes. I want to
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:37.400]  save my country for me, my children, my grandchildren and everyone else is too. Oh, by the way,
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:43.240]  but you know, I'll admit to a selfish goal. I want it better for my family.
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:49.400]  You're right though. When I see her, she's one of the most hateful people on a power trip.
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:54.040]  I mean, it's hard to march around like that. I march around like that for one minute when I'm
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:57.400]  mad at my kids and they start asking me, dad, what do we do wrong? And I have to tell them to
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:02.840]  do their chores. I mean, she really radiates anger and hatred all the time. That's got to be exhausting.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.760]  Well, I think it is. And I think that's why she can't do what she needs to do. And you also note,
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:14.680]  she cannot perform. She cannot have a press conference because she cannot answer questions.
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:20.680]  She is a volcano about to erupt. And as I said in chapter 50, she's cognitively impaired. She just
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:25.240]  can't handle questions. If you think you could have asked her as many questions as you asked me
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:30.280]  and gotten as many answers, think again, she can't do it. So she's getting more and more arrogant
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:34.280]  as it goes. If you've got to go on her channel, have you down in the studio the next few weeks.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.480]  We'll just do five more minutes on what you think she'll do with the nuclear launch codes
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:44.040]  and the buttons because I know the Russians have psychoanalyzed her and the Russians openly say,
[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:48.040]  we don't normally get involved. We don't know about Trump, but Hillary is dangerous.
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:30:05.640]  We are scared of her. We'll be back. The Ohio mayor that restricted the size of Trump rallies
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:11.400]  has campaigned with Hillary Clinton reports the American Mirror. Less than 24 hours ago,
[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:16.440]  Columbus Mayor Andrew Jinter campaigned with Hillary Clinton during a visit to the city.
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.360]  He even got a shout out from the candidate herself with Clinton telling the crowd she
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:25.560]  was happy to be in his capital city. The mayor posted his photo on his Facebook page,
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:30.760]  clearly pleased to be aiding Clinton. Are you ready to build a future that includes
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:36.920]  everyone in America? Jinter said, according to the Post Gazette, we are so honored to have such a
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:42.520]  great outpouring of support for Secretary Clinton in the most important city in the most important
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:48.280]  state in America. I need a partner in the White House that can deliver. Trump said his crowd
[02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:52.760]  size was restricted by the fire marshal, but the nominee said that the building could hold
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:31:22.680]  several more people. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:08.680]  do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty
[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:14.600]  much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:20.680]  and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:25.480]  that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:31.720]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[02:32:31.720 --> 02:32:34.200]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:39.560]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.640]  a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:46.840]  because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense,
[02:32:46.840 --> 02:32:50.680]  infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body,
[02:32:50.680 --> 02:32:55.880]  period. And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group,
[02:32:55.880 --> 02:33:17.320]  from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:35.400]  During the break, and it was every channel. Republicans withdraw support from Trump. He's
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:40.840]  in big trouble. And it's all the John McCain's, the George Herbert Walker Bush's, the
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.280]  establishment Republicans that you've seen over and over again that are basically Democrats that
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:54.520]  took over the Republican Party with the Rockefellers and others. And we've got all these GOP Congress
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:59.720]  from coming out and quote, backing Clinton. This is the power structure that's been sharing power,
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:08.520]  openly revealing themselves. That's what Trump has forced them to do. And quite frankly,
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:13.240]  it's genius. Thank God, the Republican establishment that lied us into the Iraq war,
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:21.240]  and all this is against them. And they put up that horrible person onto CNN and onto MSNBC,
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:26.440]  like Al Sharpton up there, tells us how Trump's bad over saying, what's this Muslim guy doing up
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:32.120]  there with his wife with a headdress on, not allowed to talk? Oh, you attacked a family.
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:35.960]  What about the ISIS cutting off millions of Christians heads around the world or hundreds
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:41.400]  of thousands in Syria? It's just crazy. So they're creating this whole illusion,
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:47.160]  as Matt was saying during the break, to make the Republicans look divided. So the average
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:52.280]  Republican thinks, I better vote for Gary Johnson, that quizzling of the Clintons.
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:58.040]  And that's what he's doing when Trump's got to go to the Bernie people and get them on board.
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:03.160]  So it's all about people at home going, well, I'm with the establishment. Yeah, the bandwagon.
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:08.600]  Yeah. I mean, thank God, John McCain is against Trump. That's why you're for him. I mean, John
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:14.360]  McCain vacations and hangs out with the Clintons and hangs out with George Soros. I mean, give me
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:18.200]  a break. They think we're ignorant. Going back to Dolly Collin for a few minutes, we're gonna get
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:21.320]  it down here in studio in the near future. She wrote the book, Hillary, the other woman,
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:28.920]  a political memoir, wndbooks.com. What do you make of this whole attack piece that's taking place
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.880]  and the Republican establishment doing this? Well, what's your view on Donald J. Trump?
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:40.440]  I wish I knew Donald Trump better. When he started running, I didn't know anything about
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:45.320]  him. And I thought it was sort of a publicity stunt and a joke. Obviously, it is no joke.
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:52.200]  And I am, but I am amused watching the power structure as you just talked. They are so afraid
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:59.800]  of him and they're jealous. You know, these are men who are jealous of a real man with a spine
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:06.280]  and a backbone. And I think that a lot of people are not realizing that part of Trump's appeal
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:12.680]  is that John Wayne nature of his character. Like, I'm going to go in here and do what I believe
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:19.560]  is the right thing because I love America. It's not a swagger. He's very confident and it radiates.
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:26.920]  Exactly. It really does. And there are very few men like that. And I think I wrote in this book
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:33.080]  something about if, if, uh, if Congress, if Republicans in Congress could have grown a
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:39.480]  collective spine, Donald Trump wouldn't have gotten anywhere, but Americans are.
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:41.560]  That's right. He entered a vacuum where there's no men.
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:46.840]  There are no men. It's like, where are the men? I don't, I guess they're in the transgender bathroom.
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:51.080]  I don't know where they are, but they're, they're not running for office. They're not serving their
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:55.800]  country for the most part. There are a few exceptions, but it's like, what's in the water
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:01.480]  when they get to Washington and his whole third party thing. I mean, if you don't learn from history,
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:06.920]  you're doomed to repeat it. This is not a country that works with third parties yet.
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:13.080]  And go back to 92. If Ross Perot had not run, Billy Clinton would not have run the, won the
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:19.000]  election. Let me go further. When you have a John McCain third party disillusion of votes
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:25.080]  is what caused Clinton to get in. And the other thing is this, these 25 million Christians
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:30.280]  who sat home in 2012 because they couldn't vote for either of the candidates because they weren't
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:36.600]  good enough. Let me clue. I have read the Bible numerous times, including the book of Revelation.
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:42.760]  Jesus is not coming back to run for president of the United States. And therefore people,
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:48.360]  we are always going to have flawed candidates. But I think it is morally and theologically
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:54.360]  imperative to vote for the candidate, the flawed candidates who will do the most
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:38:02.360]  for the benefit of the country. And I'm not saying hand out the most stuff to the most people.
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:08.600]  I'm talking about the overall benefit of the country. And that means a place with borders.
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:15.640]  And by the way, everyone should go look on YouTube and see the video of Hillary in 2008
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.720]  when she was campaigning saying, we need to enforce our borders. And it's necessary.
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:25.960]  We need to build a wall in some places. Great point. Earlier, you said you
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.200]  didn't want to go to that nightmare scenario, but you started going there. The hatred Hillary has,
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.600]  the, the, the radiated aggression, the fact that she can't have press conferences.
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:40.440]  I mean, this is how a dictator operates. When you talk about her hatred and just saying, look at her
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:44.600]  in your personal experiences, what do you think drives that? And what I've been told,
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.440]  and this was out years ago. It's now mainstream news. Staffers can't look her in the eye. She never
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:56.360]  gives tips. She'll have a waitress fired if she looks at her. I mean, this is quite possibly
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:01.800]  a borderline personality disorder, psycho, eco, egomaniac, narcissists. I mean, what would you
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:08.200]  call her? Well, I will say this because of my own personal history and what I studied. And that was
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:15.400]  about sex addiction because when I was a 16 year old virgin, just getting ready to go off to college,
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:22.120]  yes, at 16, because I skipped two grades, I was drugged and raped by one of Billy Clinton's friends.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:27.480]  And that changed the trajectory of my life. People who have been raped generally tend to go
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:33.960]  toward promiscuity or fragility. I went toward promiscuity. I realized I had a problem. I,
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:40.040]  I put a, I got a label on it. I got therapy. I talked to Billy Clinton about it. He admitted
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.240]  that he was a sex addict. And I'm going all the way around the bush to say this. I think Hillary
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:53.080]  was sexually molested by a woman. And I think she was sexually molested by a man. I do not think
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:58.520]  she has received any treatment. She does not understand anything about her own inner motivations.
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:04.520]  She hates the women, the women per se who molested her and the men who molested her,
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:09.720]  and she looks in the mirror and she hates herself and she projects that. And I'm sorry,
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:15.000]  this is psychology 101. You don't even have to take 39 hours of it like I did to see what's
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:20.600]  going on with this woman. I tell you, she racks very unstable and very, very dangerous. He keeps
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:24.680]  saying Trump does. He's just a confident winner who, from all the women they said, he treats
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:31.640]  the women really, really great as a super big gentleman. And you know, I haven't, I haven't
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:39.560]  met Donald Trump, but here's the thing. Hillary Clinton knew in 1974 that she was going to be
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:45.400]  riding Billy, Billy Clinton's coattails as far as she could. And from that moment on, everything
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:52.920]  she did was geared toward where she is right now, which is aiming at the White House. And so it was
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:41:00.200]  premeditated, intentional, every act that she committed from shredding Marla Crider's cute
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:04.040]  little notes and things that she sent to Billy when she was dating him at the University of
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:10.520]  Arkansas, shredding those, shredding the visitors' logs at the governor's mansion when they left,
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:14.360]  so there was no record of me or anything. What about them stealing the silverware and George
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:21.160]  Washington's plates? I mean, these are kleptocratic people. Oh yeah. Absolutely they are. And
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:27.640]  then, you know, I mean, we kind of touched the tip of the iceberg here, and I hope we haven't
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:32.280]  ruined the story for anyone who's going to read it, but I think it's a pretty well-written book.
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:39.480]  I'm so happy as of today I have 350 five-star reviews of my book, and I'm pretty tickled with
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:42.680]  that. Absolutely. Look, they don't want your book getting out. You're very obviously smart,
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:47.000]  well-spoken lady. I can't wait to get down here to Austin, Texas and interview you here in studio.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:52.040]  Dolly Kyle, thank you so much for spending time with us today. You're welcome. It's fun, Alex,
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:57.640]  that you sent. God bless. But he has a lot of courage, and she's on record, photograph with
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:02.280]  Clinton the whole nine yards. It's just all part of the whole paradigm, and of course they attack
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:06.040]  the person that's, you know, they're telling you the story, and she's saying, Bill's nice to her,
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:12.920]  but she was raped by some of his friends, though, and you look at Hillary, something's wrong with
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:18.600]  her. I mean, I'm going to be honest, everybody, I'm not in the victimology. I don't think I was
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:23.400]  sexually abused when I was 12 and 13, about 15, 16 year old girls. I mean, I'm not bragging about
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:29.000]  being promiscuous when I was younger, but I just, I'm owning that as being lucky. I'm not complaining
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:34.600]  about it, because I was a man by then, or at least physically I was, but I can imagine other people
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:42.040]  in their psychology, somebody forcing something on them, and I guess it affects people in different
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:48.840]  ways. But if you're 13 years old, and you're over at a girl's house, and the 18 year old sister
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:53.800]  comes back from college and throws you on the bed, I didn't think of that as rape. I can tell you
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:57.560]  right now, though, I know there are people that do, like, grab women and tie them up in a blanket,
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:02.200]  and then, you know, really rape them, and that's terrible, but I'm just trying to understand what
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:13.480]  would make Hillary be so incredibly whacked out? What would turn her into this monster that's out
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:20.840]  to get everybody? Because the Clintons are just absolutely horrible people, and you talk to all
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:24.760]  the people that have been around them, the Secret Service agents, the FBI agents, the state police,
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:28.760]  all of them, they say, Bill just wants to sort cocaine and have sex with 5, 10 women a day.
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:31.880]  Occasionally, he wants to rape a woman. If he wants them and can't have them, he'll do it.
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:36.520]  Later in life. But it was Hillary, and there is the prime mover selling the missiles,
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:41.720]  wanting the money, you know, making deals with the Russians. It also seems like she gets off on
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.640]  being able to do whatever she wants, but I've talked to folks for decades about her at Bilderberg,
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:52.200]  and a lot of times we won't get any intel from people until after it's over, because Hillary's
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:44:03.960]  so rude and so hateful that she just absolutely wants to dominate and crush everybody. And because
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:10.120]  she grew up as kind of a Saul Alinsky Acolyte who hates capitalism and wealth, despite the fact
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:14.760]  that she's in the middle of capitalism and stolen so much of it, and lives on red carpets and on,
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:20.840]  you know, luxury jetliners, she still sees flyover country with your little four bedroom house and
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:26.680]  your little swimming pool, and your little gazebo and barbecue pit, you know, that she's gonna show
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:31.560]  you. And she's gonna take what you got, you know, so many people, I'm gonna go to your calls,
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:39.400]  say, hey, we got a big boom under the Clintons, and it's true. In that economy, there was more of
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:42.920]  an economic boom than we've seen since then, because that was the end of the country. That's
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:47.880]  what the banksters do in Brazil, or Chile, or Nigeria, or the hundreds of other countries
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:53.160]  they've done it in, they come in and they balloon the currency, they put the nation massively in debt,
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:56.920]  you're just getting a little bit of the money from the inflation,
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:04.520]  and the trickle down spending. The trillions in derivatives they're creating and the counterfeit,
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:09.720]  you're going to be signed on to it, and you're gonna be a slave. The big banks are getting the
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:15.240]  main benefit up front and throughout the process, and in the bailout that came in 2008. And they
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:18.600]  admit the Clintons are the main authors of that, along with the Republican establishment.
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:30.120]  But I know this, watching the Republican establishment come out and decry and put down
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:39.400]  Donald Trump, and just much to about nothing, and one time he made fun of someone who was disabled,
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:43.720]  and oh, and then make that up, and oh my gosh, he said, what's this guy up here on TV with a
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:49.560]  woman with a hood over, and a certain point, I can't go to Saudi Arabia and preach the gospel,
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.240]  they can shoot their mouth off about me all day, and that's okay, but here it's like, oh no,
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:46:00.280]  you did something wrong. This is all, again, this much to about nothing, creating this perception
[02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:05.080]  that Trump can't win and Trump's bad for all the little mindless followers that kind of get on the
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:09.960]  bandwagon. Well, here it is, Bernie supporters, you're able to talk and are pretty smart when
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:15.640]  we've talked to you. Hillary's supporters can't even hardly talk. You got robbed, they say you
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:19.960]  didn't, are you going to try to landslide this for Trump, who agrees with you on NAFTA and GAF?
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:24.840]  Hillary agrees with you on nothing. Hillary is horrible with every corrupt Wall Street interest
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:32.920]  there is. Donald Trump's old fashioned blue collar JFK type guy, I wouldn't even call the guy
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:37.880]  conservative. It's just like a throwback. I mean, what you're seeing is just an Americana,
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:46.040]  you know, a swaggering, you know, that's it. And he doesn't have it out to screw you.
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:52.920]  And he's always talked about globalists and big multinationals screwing him,
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:58.760]  he doesn't like them. They know that, they've got his MO. They are scared to death of him,
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:07.960]  and the guy is real. The guy is real, really off the reservation. Let's play this Hannity clip
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:11.880]  that I'm going to. Here's another clip where he clarified and expand on, yeah, it's a crooked
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:17.240]  system. Here it is. You said at a speech today, you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:24.760]  Explain. Yeah. Well, I've been, I've been hearing about it for a long time. And I know last time
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.400]  there were your precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican.
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:34.360]  And I think that's wrong. I think that was unfair, frankly, to Mitt Romney. You had areas where a lot
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:39.000]  of people were curious. How is that possible? And I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.040]  And I just hope that there's really, I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:48.440]  because I think we're going to win this election. But if it's rigged like anything else, look, it
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:52.840]  was rigged. I thought a little bit for me and we won in landslides. I think it was rigged against
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:57.080]  Bernie Sanders with his super delegates nonsense. Absolutely. Well, we know it was right now. We
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:02.600]  have a chance. And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's going
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:06.840]  to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:11.240]  from us. That's right. And he's creating the narrative that is true that she already stole
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:18.040]  the nomination from Bernie. And so you'd be insane not to comment on it. In fact,
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:21.400]  let's go to some calls that I've got this clip. Bernie supporters now saying they're going for
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:26.920]  Trump. That's what this whole Republican shift is. This whole, they already betrayed Trump. They
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:31.480]  already tried to take him down. They didn't, they already left him. I mean, I expect like every
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:36.600]  month they're going to leave Trump again. The same traders, the same Rhino Republicans are going to
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:43.080]  leave him every month because they think you have the memory of a goldfish. All these Republicans
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:49.000]  already signed a letter in the weekly standard. They already signed a letter in national review.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.640]  They already went out and did all this before. And they just think you're an idiot going,
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.520]  that's it. We're mad. We're leaving you, Trump. Insulting your intelligence.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:05.640]  Isn't all the longest here. Charles and Georgia, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:11.800]  It is a pleasure to be back on the show with you talking to you again, General. I can't even
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.320]  remember the last time you and I spoke. Well, good to talk to you. Charles, good to hear your voice.
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:21.880]  First of all, I would like to thank our US service men and women for fighting to protect
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:25.400]  our First Amendment rights and all of our other freedoms as well.
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:32.440]  I'd like to thank you guys here at info wars.com for helping other citizens, journalists out here
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:37.080]  like us and other people that you have on your show to get the truth out. Because if it wasn't for
[02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:41.240]  you guys, I don't know where we would be and we wouldn't be able to get there. Well, I want to be
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:45.880]  clear. It's all the smaller and medium sized media that feeds the awakenings. You're just as
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:52.760]  important as info wars are. Thank you so much for realizing that. And what I want to ask you,
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:57.960]  I want to make an announcement, but what I want to ask you first is if you have any, if you,
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:02.600]  we agree with Trump down here in Georgia, I've gotten a lot of my friends and family members
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:06.840]  to subscribe to your YouTube channel and to listen to your show. And because I told them
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:12.120]  that's the only real news info wars.com, Matt Drudge and the people that you have on the,
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:17.080]  he has on the show. My question to you before I make this important announcement to you guys
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:25.560]  is do you have any additional information on 9 11 and the Saudi connection? Because we agree
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:29.560]  with Donald Trump, Donald Trump said that he was going to come out and let me answer that
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:32.360]  after the, let me answer that after the break, but real quick, make your announcement. That's
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:40.600]  a big subject 9 11 and go ahead. My announcement is I have a powerful documentary film. I would
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:45.640]  like to share with you guys at info wars and info wars. I've seen it. I forget your YouTube channel.
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:48.360]  We've linked to it before, but I remember your name, Charles. What's the name of your YouTube
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:56.120]  channel? And you got some viral videos. My YouTube channel is nation of true. You guys need to check
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:51:02.680]  that out. And we have revealing the mind of a time with part two. All right, we're going to plug that.

[02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:11.000]  heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines and
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:15.560]  pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants. And no, water treatment plants
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:20.040]  are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out. Protect your family's water supply
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:25.480]  with a trusted Big Berkey water filter. New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey

[02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:29.000]  of an IRA to help build our retirement income. Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset,
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  and we would have the security of knowing we're protected. No matter what the economy does,

[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:25.480]  Peter T. Olde, the billionaire Builderburg Group member of the Big Star of the RNC. I don't think
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:29.320]  he's a bad guy for going to Builderburg. I'd go if I was invited. He doesn't really promote
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:33.720]  globalism himself, but he does promote some new World War stuff. He's come out and he's
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:38.040]  obsessed with the blood transfusions that the elite have been doing for over 50, 60 years and
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:42.360]  trying to live forever, live longer. I've got a special report that we're going to be airing tomorrow.
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:47.240]  Look for that. There's another article by Kit Daniels. It's very interesting.
[02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:54.200]  On infowars.com, scientists humanity faces great filter as early species in universe.
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:55:00.920]  Will we transcend the predatory elite to reach the stars? Kit Daniels. It's a journal of cosmology
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:07.000]  and arrows particle physics. It deals with the fact that we live in a high radiation
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:12.440]  zone and that as radiation dissipates in the universe, they'll be more alive. It's just an
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:19.160]  interesting thing to look at and think about. We live in an area so packed with radiation,
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:27.560]  you go outside your skin burns. We are tough stuff baby and we are made by something even tougher.
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:37.400]  Yes, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray. Let's go ahead and take a few more
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:41.000]  calls. First off, I want to just say Paul Watson is doing the balance of the next hour
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:46.120]  and he'll be co-hosting with David Knight tomorrow while I work on some important projects,
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:49.160]  but I've got some special reports going to be filed as well. They're going to be airing tomorrow.
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:54.520]  Briefly, we are having to end obviously the huge mega specials, the biggest in our history that
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:00.200]  we're on all items, 40 to 20% off depending on them at infowars.com. But we've kept three of the
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:05.800]  best sellers, the vitamin mineral fusion, the brain force, the DNA force, 40% off on brain force,
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:12.520]  30% off on DNA force, 30% off on vitamin mineral fusion and free shipping. Didn't have that during
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:17.880]  the super special. And we have a lot of other items as well, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:22.040]  If you're not giving your kids especially vitamin mineral fusions to actually absorb the vitamins
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:25.880]  and minerals and amino acids, you're crazy in my view. If you're not filtering your water and we
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:30.280]  got the best systems, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure, I think you're crazy. Plus, you're funding this
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:36.760]  transmission. So, I mean, it's a win-win-win from every direction. Where can you look anywhere
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:41.640]  in even mainstream media and see someone or an organization putting out talking points,
[02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:46.280]  countervailing the establishment BS? We have a great responsibility here. I'm very honored to be
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:54.440]  part of it. That earlier caller had a question about 9-11. That is too big of a question to get
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:58.920]  into. The official story is not true. Criminal elements of our government that you see against
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:05.560]  Trump are allied with Saudi Arabia. And that attack was meant to take out Saudis enemies,
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:09.320]  blaming Iraq for what Saudi Arabia was involved in. It's all part of a larger program.
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:14.040]  Let's talk to Warren in New Hampshire. Warren, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.800]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing? I've been listening to you since 97, 98. I first
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:25.320]  talked to you on the start wave and I got your first video, American Destroyed by Design,
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:29.480]  which is a BHS. Yes, sir. You made it all possible. You've been there since the start.
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:35.000]  Yeah. What I was going to say is because it's late in the game, because I've listened to you,
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.320]  I've done a lot of work on this myself, the New World Order and how things run.
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:41.400]  Oh, it's late in the game. It's all admitted now.
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:49.080]  Yeah, very late in the game. But I know that you're missing a point, not you,
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:54.920]  but the whole movement in and of itself. Everybody talks about the New World Order,
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:59.320]  the power, the power, the power. They really don't have any power.
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:07.000]  They got the money supply and that's where they direct their power. If you and Donald Trump would
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:12.760]  come out and just let the globalists know that we're going to change our money supply back to
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:18.920]  our control, which is going to change everything, you're going to see them both faster. I think
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:22.920]  that's the final nail in the coffin. Well, here's the deal. Trump said he's taking the gloves off.
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:28.280]  He has Obama and everybody's super scared. I guarantee you, they're hovering over orders
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:33.640]  to kill him right now. They're deciding how to kill Trump right now. But they now have clicked
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:37.560]  that Trump's ready and prepared for that. The guy's incredible. I'm telling you, folks,
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:43.720]  Trump is amazing. He is ready to die. He is. He's the real deal. He really is the real deal.
[02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:46.120]  We'll be right back with five more minutes and I'm going to hand them a talk.
[02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:54.840]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:58:54.840 --> 02:58:59.640]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates,
[02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:05.560]  the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here
[02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:10.600]  in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have
[02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:15.560]  now developed Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:20.600]  your coworkers, your family, your children to the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:59:20.600 --> 02:59:25.880]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:31.960]  avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze
[02:59:31.960 --> 02:59:38.280]  would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:59:38.280 --> 02:59:41.880]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older,
[02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:47.400]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary
[02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:55.720]  today. Then forward store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:19.720]  Of human liberty. Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:27.880]  I hope that judge in blind.
[03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:33.560]  All I know is I can spiritually pick up to the global star.
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:42.440]  He can torture me to death. I'm never joining you. And they know that. I wish people could get
[03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:46.680]  close to this evil once or twice. Like Joe Scalzen was talking about yesterday and you'd never want
[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:51.000]  to be part of it. All right. I want to play this clip and go back to your calls and Paul Watson's
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:54.200]  coming up. There's a bunch of these videos. I want to play one that shows how much women
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:58.200]  who are Democrats hate Hillary. I mean, this is really them just installing their little
[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:03.960]  bottom paid for princess. But we got another clip that shows how many Bernie supporters are
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:10.280]  planning to vote for Donald Trump. Here it is. I'm Calvin Phillips, the campus reform today.
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:14.600]  We're in Philadelphia at the DNC talking to angry Bernie protesters. But whether or not
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:17.960]  they're going to be voting for Hillary in November, we're switching parties to vote for
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:23.320]  Donald Trump. Let's see what they have to say. I was strong for Bernie and now I'm taking a
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:28.280]  stand for Trump. I'm going to use all of my time and energy to make sure Hillary doesn't win
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:32.520]  after the convention. So in a swing state you consider Trump? Yes. And do you think other
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:37.160]  Bernie supporters in swing states will consider voting for Trump to deny Hillary office? I know
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:41.160]  they will. I know a lot of them and they already said they will. Had to vote for Trump or Hillary.
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:44.680]  I'd pick Trump. You say that you would possibly consider voting for Trump if the race were closed.
[03:01:44.680 --> 03:01:48.920]  Do you think other Bernie supporters would do that? Absolutely. You guys need to know.
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:52.440]  It wouldn't be surprising to you to see a big chunk of the Bernie people go to Trump?
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:59.880]  No, no. And I wouldn't. And I have many intelligent peers within this movement who
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:04.440]  have said the same thing. Some people that maybe Bernie is the person that they stuck with right
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:09.320]  now. But there are some things just anti-establishment and they'll go with Trump to send that message.
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:15.880]  I've posted on it on my social media and quite a few people are going to go with Trump. Some
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:20.840]  people are cheap and they're going to fall in line and vote for Hillary. As I spend time talking
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:26.040]  to Trump supporters, we agree on a lot of major issues that we're facing in this country. We're
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:31.160]  both mad about the same things. Do you think other people like you are going to go to Trump?
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:36.440]  I've heard that a lot of people are saying, they're saying to me, man, thank you for saying
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:40.760]  what I can't say yet. I'm done with the Democratic Party. So you've left the Democrat Party. Do
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:43.960]  you think that a lot of other Bernie supporters are going to do the same if they haven't already?
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:49.000]  Yes, a lot have and a lot will after this convention. If Bernie is not the Democratic nominee,
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.760]  then I will certainly leave the Democratic Party. Do you think you'll leave the Democratic Party then?
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:03:00.280]  Yeah. I mean, there's nothing Democratic about this. I've already unregistered with the Democratic
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:04.040]  Party, so I think that should answer it. As soon as I get back home, that's exactly what I'm going
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:08.440]  to do. I can go back to the Democratic Party. Do you feel like Hillary is trying to press
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:13.560]  her women to vote for her just because she's a woman? Oh my God, yes. She is a con artist.
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:18.440]  She's a con artist and she's definitely going to push that card. You can't say vote for me
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:23.400]  because I'm a feminist. Vote for me because I'm a woman and just expect us. She is not a feminist.
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:28.760]  She is not fighting for women. She never has and she never will. You colluded with her to win the
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:33.400]  election and it's another slap in the face. It's why would we get in the party line after
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:39.560]  all this? I'm throwing this race to Trump. And that's what every Bernie person I talk to
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:45.240]  says. They're going to vote third party or for Trump. And again, I mean, I'm in middle of Austin,
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:49.320]  the supposedly liberal. I've never really found any Hillary supporters unless it's down at the
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:57.400]  city council or the legislature about a bunch of rich people. I mean, that's it. You go in the
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:04.600]  richest areas of Austin, though you will see the unicorn, which is the rare creature, the narwhal
[03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:11.640]  of the land. You will see Hillary signs. I have seen them in the twilight quickly driving by,
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:23.080]  but nowhere else, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere. And I've been all over the country
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:27.640]  and that's why people are so angry and so upset. And that's why they've got this big fake split
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:31.880]  that Republicans have all turned against him. They're all giving pledges to vote for Hillary.
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:38.760]  They were already saying they weren't for Trump. No surprise. Paul Watson from London,
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:45.640]  England is coming up. The infowars nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central standard time.
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:52.120]  Right here on the GCN radio network. I'm Alex Jones. Remember they're trying to censor information,
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:58.680]  get involved, share our links, our videos, create your own, fight back. An epic war is taking place
[03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:05.160]  and quite frankly, we're winning. The Islamic State is specifically targeting the U.S. Army,
[03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:11.160]  putting out a list of 700 soldiers the terror army wants to kill, reports The Washington Times.
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:16.920]  United cyber caliphate, the Islamic State's three month old hacking consortium has posted a number
[03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:22.440]  of such lists. Analysts say most names appear to be publicly available and randomly chosen
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:27.960]  as opposed to the UCC actually hacking into a website and stealing the information.
[03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:33.720]  In the July 25th posting by the Islamic State, a Pentagon official told The Washington Times,
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:39.560]  analysts have not yet found an open source for the army kill list. The possibility is that one or
[03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:45.000]  more government sites were hacked. The source said the Islamic States U.S. Army list begins with the
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:51.800]  headline. We want them hashtag dead, hashtag revenge for Muslims, kill the dogs. You can find

[03:07:04.680 --> 03:07:10.360]  joins us. You worked I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force did. I've been working
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:15.560]  all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of
[03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:19.320]  run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good
[03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:23.640]  job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there and pop two of them and about
[03:07:23.640 --> 03:07:28.840]  20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars.

[03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:48.200]  without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up,
[03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:53.880]  took two more brain force and came in. You will find brain force and other game changing products

[03:07:59.080 --> 03:08:12.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:08:12.200 --> 03:08:29.800]  We're back for the fourth hour live overdrive of the Alex Jones show with me, your host Paul Joseph
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:36.920]  Watson from somewhere in France, halfway up a mountain via the wonders of modern technology,
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:43.720]  a laptop and a cell phone connection. I'm speaking to you. Have you heard the amazing,
[03:08:43.720 --> 03:08:50.120]  incredible, horrifying, disturbing new scandal about Donald Trump? Well, of course, the mainstream
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:56.360]  media, the establishment can find absolutely nothing on him. They can barely find dirt under
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:09:02.360]  his fingernails. Meanwhile, crooked Hillary Clinton has a million skeletons in her closet,
[03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:08.120]  but we're not talking about that. We're talking about Donald Trump making a joke in front of a
[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:14.760]  veteran where he said it was easier to get a purple star, a purple heart if he was given one
[03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:24.040]  rather than fighting for one in combat. Oh my God, how offensive, the scandal, the horror.
[03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:31.560]  This is out of the Daily Mail. Trump makes light of military sacrifice again when veteran gives
[03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:36.680]  him his purple heart. I always wanted to get the purple heart. This was so much easier. Now,
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:43.320]  bear in mind, the veteran who you was talking to on stage laughed at the joke,
[03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:50.120]  laughed at the joke. But that's not good enough. Of course, everybody else has to get offended
[03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:56.520]  on his behalf. And this is the damning new evidence that Donald Trump hates the military.
[03:09:56.520 --> 03:10:03.000]  He made a light hearted joke on stage with a veteran, and the veteran laughed at the joke.
[03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:11.320]  My God. This is a catastrophe for the Donald Trump campaign. However, will he come back from this
[03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:23.160]  devastating blow to his credibility? God only knows. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has been exposed
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:29.960]  as being instrumental in selling weapons to Jihadists and being instrumental in the rise of
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:36.920]  ISIS. Nobody's talking about that. Donald Trump made a joke about a medal on a stage.
[03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:43.080]  That's what the media is talking about. That's the big scandal. Of course, the other scandal
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:50.760]  is this, again, absolutely disturbing to the core. Breitbart reports panic mode because
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:56.760]  he can't delete law firm website that specialized in Muslim immigration. Now recall because he
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:05.080]  can't again go up on stage at the DNC. Does Muslim gold star father, his son died in Iraq?
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:10.360]  And he went at Donald Trump for being a bigger for being an Islamophobe again,
[03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:15.880]  simply for making his comments on the fact that we need to vet thousands of immigrants
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:23.000]  that are coming in from countries such as Syria, where 21% of them support ISIS. Of course,
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:26.280]  that's racist. That's Islamophobic. That's bigoted to do that.
[03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:33.560]  Kazia Khan got up on stage, made this big play. Of course, the media picked up on it. This was
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:40.280]  the huge massive new scandal. But not only did Donald Trump hate Muslims, he also hates the
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:48.440]  military. No conversation whatsoever about how Hillary Clinton's own policies with regard to
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:56.920]  Libya led to the rise of ISIS led to the international migrant crisis that just killed,
[03:11:56.920 --> 03:12:04.520]  you know, 200 more Muslims today trying to cross on a boat that led to arming jihadists in Syria,
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:11.560]  those rebel factions that joined up with ISIS, who then killed tens of thousands of Muslims.
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:21.880]  We came, we saw, he died. Hillary Clinton did all that, not Donald Trump. Donald Trump made a remark
[03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:29.400]  about vetting immigrants coming into the country to prevent terrorism. Hillary Clinton's own policies
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:35.720]  directly led to the rise of ISIS, the international migrant crisis, and tens of thousands of dead
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:42.200]  Muslims. But who's worse? Of course, it's Donald Trump because he said something that might be
[03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:48.440]  politically incorrect. My God. Kazia Khan, the Muslim gold star father that Democrats and their
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:54.280]  allies, media wide have been using to hammer GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, has deleted
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:13:00.760]  his law firm's website from the internet. This development is significant as his website proved,
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:07.240]  as Breitbart News and others have reported, that he financially benefits from unfettered pay-to-play
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:13.720]  Muslim migration into America. A snapshot of his now deleted website, as captured by the Wayback
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:19.000]  Machine, which takes snapshot shots, archiving various websites on the internet, shows that as
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:25.560]  a lawyer, he engages in procurement of EB-5 immigration visas and other, quote, related
[03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:31.800]  immigration services. The website is now completely removed from the internet and instead directs
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:39.880]  visitors to the URL at which it was once page parking the URL run by GoDaddy. So basically,
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:45.560]  this Kazia Khan has now been exposed as a complete hypocrite. He's got skin in the game.
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:53.880]  He's linked in with the Democratic establishment. He's linked in benefiting directly, financially,
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:14:00.440]  personally, from Muslim migration into America. This is the guy who got up on stage and said,
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:07.800]  Donald Trump was an awful, terrible, evil person for suggesting, just for suggesting,
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:14.040]  that maybe it's a good idea to vet Muslim migrants coming into the United States when
[03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:20.760]  around 21% of them, in the case of Syrians, support ISIS. They've got beheading videos on
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:26.920]  their cell phones. They've got ISIS flags on their cell phones. We've got attacks every single
[03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:34.040]  frigging week in Europe by these refugees. Maybe it's a good idea to vet them, but no.
[03:14:34.040 --> 03:14:41.320]  Donald Trump's evil Hillary Clinton, whose policies in arming jihadists in Syria, in attacking
[03:14:41.320 --> 03:14:47.800]  Libya, in overthrowing a secular government that led directly to the migrant crisis, to the deaths
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:54.200]  of thousands of migrants that led directly to the rise of ISIS, who killed tens of thousands of
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:15:03.720]  Muslims. She's good with the Muslims. She's pro Islam. She's politically correct because her
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:09.160]  policies led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Muslims. Donald Trump's evil because he said
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:15.960]  something about vetting immigrants to stop terrorists. That is the narrative the media is
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:23.080]  now trying to sell you. And oh my God, Donald Trump made a lighthearted joke on stage with a
[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:29.080]  veteran, which the veteran laughed at and found funny. But no, we have to get offended on his
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:34.360]  behalf. That's terrible. Not only now does Donald Trump hate Muslims, he hates the military.
[03:15:34.360 --> 03:15:41.000]  Again, they've got absolutely nothing on it. Meanwhile, crooked Hillary, thousands of skeletons
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:48.280]  in the closet. Nobody even wants to talk about it in the media, because of course, they're in the
[03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:52.680]  tank for Hillary. Another thing they don't want to talk about, which I'm going to talk about, and
[03:15:52.680 --> 03:15:59.000]  I'm going to make a video about, is Hillary Clinton's bizarre behavior. Now you must have seen the
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:05.960]  video which we posted back about 10 days ago, two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton reacting to a
[03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:12.440]  question from a reporter. She goes off in this bizarre bobblehead procedure. Looks like she's
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:20.920]  having a seizure. She tries to recover it. It looks absolutely incredibly bizarre. A few days ago at
[03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:26.520]  the DNC, the same thing. Now I don't know what happened. They must have released some blooms or
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:31.960]  something above their heads, but it was Hillary and Bill Clinton on stage. And she suddenly
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:38.680]  catches sight of whatever's above her. And she literally looks like a three-year-old dazzled
[03:16:38.680 --> 03:16:47.080]  by blooms completely in her element, eyes darting from side to side, completely out of it. What is
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:54.360]  going on with Hillary Clinton? We know in 2012 that she had this blood clot in her brain, which
[03:16:54.360 --> 03:17:02.600]  is the blood clot in her brain. We know that she collapsed. We know that she had seizures. If you
[03:17:02.600 --> 03:17:09.240]  look at the medical information about this cerebral venous thrombosis, which is the blood clot in
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:18.920]  her brain, 43% of people who suffer that go on to have difficulties, again, with cognition, with
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:25.880]  seizures. Remember, this is a woman who constantly claims that Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:32.040]  Of course, she's talking about his policies. He's rhetoric. She could be physically unfit
[03:17:32.040 --> 03:17:40.200]  to be president. We've had memory problems. We've had the whole Bosnian sniper fire lie
[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:47.640]  that she completely made up out of whole cloth. We've had reports, again, from her secret service
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:54.520]  more recently from her own campaign inside it. We've told the New York Post that Clinton has,
[03:17:55.320 --> 03:18:02.120]  quote, been screaming and having childlike tantrums that have left staff members in tears and unable
[03:18:02.120 --> 03:18:11.560]  to work. Quote, we're having some success in giving her some chill pills. What kind of pills is Hillary
[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:18.520]  Clinton on at this point? We've had gaffes. We've had her being unable to remember things.
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:27.720]  We've had these ridiculous coughing fits, which, again, is another side effect of having a stroke,
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:35.240]  garbled voice, choking, coughing. If you look at the medical information surrounding this issue,
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:44.680]  motor neuron difficulties, myoclonic seizures, jerking of the eye's head or arms,
[03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:53.560]  reflex epilepsies may occur at any age. Again, these are consequences of this brain
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:19:01.480]  plot that she had back in 2012. We're now starting to see the results of that. She refuses to take
[03:19:01.480 --> 03:19:07.560]  press conference. Again, there's speculation that these seizures, these ticks, whatever they are,
[03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:15.000]  which are completely bizarre, as you can see in the videos, could be triggered by people talking,
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:20.280]  by multiple numbers of people talking around her, which is exactly what we saw with one of the most
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:27.240]  recent videos. Again, she refuses to do press conferences where you're being bombarded with
[03:19:27.240 --> 03:19:35.800]  people talking to you, interviews, and the ones that she does do are heavily scripted.
[03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:44.120]  Very bizarre behavior with Hillary Clinton. I'm talking to psychiatrist and psychologist to try
[03:19:44.120 --> 03:19:49.400]  and get a wider perspective on this, but she claims Donald Trump is unfit for office because of
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:58.680]  his policies. Could she be physically unfit for office? We'll be back with the Alex Jones show
[03:19:58.680 --> 03:20:04.040]  live breaking news at infowalls.com. Don't go away. Is the recession really over? Is a bigger one
[03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:09.480]  on the way? Will our next president lead us to prosperity and peace? Or will it all fall apart?

[03:24:20.520 --> 03:24:26.520]  We are back on the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones show and I need to tell you about our
[03:24:26.520 --> 03:24:32.840]  specials at Infowarsstore.com. We've had to pull most of them from the Operation Sleeping Giant
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:39.720]  Super Sale fundraiser last week but we have extended some of the key specials at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:24:40.520 --> 03:24:46.680]  Now, why do you need to get the products? Well, if you really want us to uncover the next
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:54.520]  aid, Skrillex, the next Call the Cook, even maybe the next Trigly Puff, then this is what
[03:24:54.520 --> 03:25:01.800]  funds us. Of course, compare Infowars now to Infowars four or five years ago. We didn't have the
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:09.800]  resources nor the staff to send people out to cover events. Again, it's amazing how much the
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:16.280]  team just in terms of numbers alone has grown over the past five, six years. When it started out,
[03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:25.400]  it was basically Alex, a lady on the phones doing sales, a website operator and me and that was it.
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:32.280]  It was basically a handful of people. Look at it now. It's a behemoth and we're challenging
[03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:36.840]  the mainstream media directly. That's the point. We're able to send people out to all these events
[03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:43.960]  to get the violent, radical, unhinge social justice warriors on camera to shine a light,
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:50.040]  to shine a mirror in their direction to prove exactly how extremist they are.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:56.760]  This is absolutely vital to derailing the mainstream media narrative. You see now,
[03:25:56.760 --> 03:26:02.200]  trust in mainstream media at record lows, people turning away from television, people turning
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:10.360]  away from print media. It's because to a larger and larger extent, we are taking their place.
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:16.200]  And that's because of you getting the products at infowarsstore.com. We simply couldn't do it
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:22.040]  without you. We couldn't pay the hotel bills. We couldn't pay the flight costs. We couldn't pay for
[03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:28.520]  the equipment. We couldn't hire the staff in the first place to do this. This is why it's so important
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:36.280]  for you to continue supporting us at infowarsstore.com. Now, we've got 40% off brain force. Again,
[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:42.920]  this is a new tropic that I've personally taken. Again, jet lagged three hours sleep flying across
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:52.600]  the Atlantic Ocean. Had to host a three hour radio show. Brain force took two pills, absolutely
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:59.960]  dynamic, laser precision, cognitive focus. This is what it gives you. I've tried some of the other
[03:26:59.960 --> 03:27:06.440]  similar products like alpha brain, which are decent, but nothing compared to this brain force.
[03:27:07.480 --> 03:27:12.680]  If you're doing any kind of mental work whatsoever, this is really going to help you out. It's helped
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:19.240]  me personally. It's helped Rob do and several other people in the info wars office. This actually
[03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:24.600]  works. This actually works to fire the neurons in your brain. It's not like caffeine. It's not some
[03:27:24.600 --> 03:27:32.600]  mad rush. It's a calm, focused effect. It helps you work. It helps you think. So we got 40% off
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:40.920]  brain force at infowarsstore.com. And again, it all goes back into the operation. It fires us up to
[03:27:40.920 --> 03:27:46.760]  take on the mainstream media to derail their narratives on a daily basis. So support us by
[03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:53.240]  getting the products at infowarsstore.com. Final couple of minutes before the break,
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:28:01.560]  we got a headline out of CNS news. Syrian refugees admitted to US in FY16, only 35 Christians.
[03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:07.240]  The Obama administration admitted 2,340 Syrian refugees into the United States in July,
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:13.960]  almost as many as the record number of admissions in June, 2,406, keeping it on track to reach its
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:20.360]  goal of 10,000 by the end of September. So you look at the percentage of sunny Muslims and
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:29.480]  Christians in July, 98.6 of the Syrian refugees admitted into the United States were sunny Muslim
[03:28:30.680 --> 03:28:37.400]  compared to 0.6% Christian. Now, if you look at the population of Syria, even as it is now,
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:45.560]  even after the civil war, it's still 10% Christian. Why aren't 10% of the Syrian refugees coming into
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:51.480]  the United States and coming into Europe for that matter? Why aren't they Christian? Why is it
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:59.240]  overwhelmingly sunny Muslims? We also have the DHS, again, in this story a couple of days ago,
[03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:08.920]  agreeing to grant amnesty to 8,000 Syrians. Now, again, 21% of Syrians, according to a poll,
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:15.000]  and I've featured this in my videos before, this is not in a right-wing newspaper, this is an
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  independent Ipsos poll of Syrians, 21% of whom said they support ISIS. So, again, of these 8,000
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:31.320]  Syrians that DHS is granting amnesty in this one program alone, not to mention the others coming
[03:29:31.320 --> 03:29:41.160]  in, statistically over 1,500 of those people granted asylum by the DHS support ISIS. But
[03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:46.920]  Donald Trump's evil for saying we should have more strenuous vetting will be back with the Alex
[03:29:46.920 --> 03:29:55.080]  Jones show I've overdrive. Don't go away. We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[03:29:55.080 --> 03:30:06.360]  and the GCN Radio Network. The Ohio mayor that restricted the size of Trump rallies, as campaigned
[03:30:06.360 --> 03:30:12.600]  with Hillary Clinton, reports the American Mirror. Less than 24 hours ago, Columbus Mayor Andrew
[03:30:12.600 --> 03:30:17.560]  Jinter campaigned with Hillary Clinton during a visit to the city. He even got a shout out from
[03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:22.360]  the candidate herself, with Clinton telling the crowd she was happy to be in his capital city.
[03:30:22.360 --> 03:30:27.960]  The mayor posted his photo on his Facebook page, clearly pleased to be aiding Clinton.
[03:30:27.960 --> 03:30:33.080]  Are you ready to build a future that includes everyone in America? Jinter said,
[03:30:33.080 --> 03:30:38.360]  according to the Post Gazette, we are so honored to have such a great outpouring of support for
[03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:44.520]  Secretary Clinton in the most important city, in the most important state in America. I need a
[03:30:44.520 --> 03:30:49.560]  partner in the White House that can deliver. Trump said his crowd size was restricted by the
[03:30:49.560 --> 03:30:54.120]  fire marshal, but the nominee said that the building could hold several more people.
[03:30:54.120 --> 03:31:03.400]  You can find more reports on infowars.com. If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful
[03:31:03.400 --> 03:31:07.240]  solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going
[03:31:07.240 --> 03:31:12.440]  to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends, we already see major power grid
[03:31:12.440 --> 03:31:17.080]  problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen, solar generators really do provide
[03:31:17.080 --> 03:31:21.800]  lifesaving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[03:31:21.800 --> 03:31:26.360]  emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous summer
[03:31:26.360 --> 03:31:31.320]  storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it
[03:31:31.320 --> 03:31:34.760]  like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:31:34.760 --> 03:31:40.280]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're giving
[03:31:40.280 --> 03:31:45.400]  away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for info

[03:32:14.120 --> 03:32:18.760]  and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses
[03:32:18.760 --> 03:32:22.680]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,

[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:22.760]  Now, this is becoming a regular segment on this show for me. It's death threat of the week.
[03:34:23.800 --> 03:34:29.160]  Now, I received this message again, more friendly words from the religion of the peace,
[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:36.600]  from a guy called Mohammed, surprisingly enough, who tells me, I am a proud British Muslim white
[03:34:36.600 --> 03:34:44.280]  male. And you know what? I find what you say about Islam offensive, and soon those words will be your
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:51.000]  last, because this is the religion of peace, of course. We Muslims do not forgive easily. We will
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:57.720]  soon take over your lands, and your women belong to us all. I'm actually correcting his typos here,
[03:34:57.720 --> 03:35:05.240]  because it's replete with them. Your white man will have only but one choice, join or die.
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:11.880]  Why? Soon you will pay for your hatred towards Islam. Your hateful nature will be meant with Allah's wrath.
[03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:19.240]  And he quotes a bunch of passages out of the Quran, out of the textbook of the religion of peace,
[03:35:19.240 --> 03:35:24.040]  which talk about how they're going to kill all the infidels, because it's a religion of peace.
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:31.240]  Again, don't you dare say that Islam is not a religion of peace. We're going to prove you wrong
[03:35:31.240 --> 03:35:40.360]  by killing you. He finishes the message by saying, your time will soon come. We Muslims will have
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:46.680]  our day, and yours will come to an end. So again, that is a friendly message from the religion of
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:52.920]  peace. But it's just a tiny minority of extremists, nothing to worry about. Just ignore those polls
[03:35:52.920 --> 03:35:58.600]  which show, you know, like 35% of Muslims in France where I am right now support suicide bombings.
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:04.920]  Just the tiny minority, again, the religion of peace. Going back to the news though, of course,
[03:36:04.920 --> 03:36:11.160]  I'm here in France, which experienced another bout of cultural enrichment last week with the
[03:36:11.160 --> 03:36:18.040]  slaying of the priest. In fact, what I've heard since I arrived here is, to a large extent,
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:23.960]  even more shocking. Now, of course, we had the story yesterday on infowars.com about
[03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:29.720]  a car bomb in London. Apparently, there was an attempt to a car bomb attack in Camden in London
[03:36:29.720 --> 03:36:37.480]  on Saturday night at peak time, where you've got thousands of people milling around, going to bars,
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:44.520]  going to clubs. A member of the public report, a suspicious vehicle, the police soon arrived and
[03:36:44.520 --> 03:36:50.040]  declared that it was a false alarm after having evacuated the entire area. Well, of course,
[03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:56.920]  somebody who worked at one of those venues told me directly that he had a conversation with the
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:37:03.160]  general manager who was close with the police who told him it was a car bomb. There was shrapnel in
[03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:10.040]  there. There were gas canisters in the car. The car was unregistered. No tax. It was a terrorist attack
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:15.240]  that they covered up. You could say, well, that's perfectly reasonable. They don't want to cause
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:23.240]  panic. But again, it happened in Germany. Remember the police officers, the paramedics who reported
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:29.960]  bombs in a fake ambulance outside a soccer stadium. They evacuated the stadium, but later said, again,
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:36.200]  that it was a false alarm. The police said it was real and that they were ordered not to talk about
[03:37:36.200 --> 03:37:42.120]  it. So in addition to all the attacks that you see across Europe, we're also having attacks,
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:48.440]  apparently, that are being covered up by the authorities. Now, it gets even more insane
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:57.640]  with this. Again, I'm here in France. My parents run a guest house. My mother teaches English to
[03:37:57.640 --> 03:38:03.640]  people from all across France, many of them in significant positions in corporations and government,
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:10.200]  also people around Europe. Now, she was told directly by one of her students
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:15.080]  that Muslim migrants, these newly arrived Muslim migrants, because, of course, we've always had
[03:38:15.080 --> 03:38:20.920]  problems with integration in the past, the Muslims would largely refuse to integrate,
[03:38:20.920 --> 03:38:27.640]  but they would still keep themselves to themselves. Now we're seeing a new breed of Muslim migrants.
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:33.880]  And she was actually told by this individual who works for a mayor in a town here in France
[03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:41.080]  that newly arrived Muslim migrants are going to government offices and threatening to kill
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:48.280]  family members of local government officials if they're not given jobs. You might say, well,
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:53.480]  that's horrible. Of course, the government officials there at the mayor's office must have
[03:38:53.480 --> 03:39:00.520]  immediately called the police reported this terroristic threat. After these Muslim migrants
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:07.480]  threatened to kill members of their family if they didn't give them jobs. Well, what happened was
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:17.320]  they gave them the jobs. Absolutely unbelievable. Actually, a giving jobs to Muslim migrants who
[03:39:17.320 --> 03:39:24.360]  threatened to kill their family members. Now you talk about France, France's history of submission
[03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:31.400]  of fealty. We saw after Charlie Hebdo after the Paris massacre, you know, hug a Muslim. Still,
[03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:36.280]  to this day, we see the Prime Minister Manuel Valle saying the French just have to live with
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:41.480]  terrorism. He came out yesterday and said the French government is still more concerned
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:49.720]  about right wing populace than Islamic terrorists. So again, this is complete capitulation.
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:55.160]  Michel Wellbeck wrote about it in his book, Submission, where he foresaw a future where
[03:39:55.160 --> 03:40:01.160]  Islamists would take power in government and take over that way. We're seeing capitulation,
[03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:07.560]  not in novel form, but in real life, actually threatening to kill family members of local
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:14.440]  officials if they're not given jobs and then being given jobs. And this is equally insane.
[03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:20.280]  You saw the story we covered last week out of Breitbart and other sources where in Germany,
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:29.320]  their culture is to have nude swimming pools. So these Muslim migrants walk up to women in
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:35.880]  these swimming pools, start screaming Allah Akbar in their faces and threatening to quote,
[03:40:35.880 --> 03:40:43.240]  exterminate them because it's a religion of peace, et cetera, et cetera. Now you think, well,
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:48.760]  this is horrible. Some swimming pools in European countries have had to introduce segregation to
[03:40:48.760 --> 03:40:59.240]  deal with this. This is a massive issue. Well, the solution in France to Muslim migrants harassing
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:04.760]  women in swimming pools, not to mention all the cases where Muslim migrants have gone into swimming
[03:41:04.760 --> 03:41:13.080]  pools and raped children and not even tried to flee the scene because it's just part of their culture.
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:19.240]  Muslim migrants going to swimming pools harassing women. The solution in some places in France,
[03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:23.720]  this is what I was told. There's no reason to believe that anyone would make this up.
[03:41:24.680 --> 03:41:31.160]  So they harass women at swimming pools, sexually assault them in some cases. The solution
[03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:39.640]  from local governments in France is to give these migrants jobs as pool attendants.
[03:41:41.400 --> 03:41:48.120]  So this is not a story out of the onion. They're actually rewarding the migrants who harass women
[03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:59.400]  at swimming pools with jobs as pool attendants, as lifeguards to help integrate them. The individual
[03:41:59.400 --> 03:42:07.880]  who spoke to us about this also said, most of these migrants can't even swim. So not only are they
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:14.760]  rewarding them for harassing women at swimming pools by giving them jobs, they're actually putting
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:18.840]  those women in even more danger, not merely because of the sexual harassment, but because
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:28.760]  these migrants can't even swim. They can't even do the job. Absolutely insane. I talked to women
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:36.120]  across Germany on Facebook, they sent me messages saying that basically sexual harassment by migrants,
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:39.480]  which of course we saw on a mass scale in Cologne and Hamburg on New Year's Eve,
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:47.080]  we saw it in Sweden with the music festivals recently. One woman in Germany told me basically
[03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:54.440]  sexual harassment by migrants is quote, now part of my daily life. Bearing in mind, this is a woman
[03:42:54.440 --> 03:43:02.920]  who was left wing. She was a campaigner for refugees welcome. Well, not so much now,
[03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:11.400]  because she says every single day, whether it be a bus terminal, a train station, walking down the
[03:43:11.400 --> 03:43:19.880]  street, harassment, sexual harassment by migrants is now a daily part of her life.
[03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:26.600]  We had a story out of the UK. From the express, police arrest 900 Syrians in England and Wales
[03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:32.760]  for crimes including rape and child abuse. Okay, we've admitted 1600 refugees from Syria into the
[03:43:32.760 --> 03:43:39.560]  United Kingdom over the past year. Of course, there would have been some Syrian migrants already here
[03:43:39.560 --> 03:43:44.760]  before that time, but probably not that many. So out of 1600 Syrians in the UK,
[03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:51.000]  it's already here before that time, but probably not that many. So out of 1600 that we've admitted
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:44:00.600]  over the last year and whoever was here originally, 900 of them have been arrested already for crimes
[03:44:00.600 --> 03:44:10.520]  including rape and child abuse. Absolutely astonishing. The media won't talk about it.
[03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:16.440]  They will talk about someone being mean to a Muslim on a bus. And that becomes
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:22.760]  part of the narrative for the next two weeks. Oh, a massive hate crime wave sweeping the United
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:29.960]  Kingdom. Meanwhile, we have an actual crime wave sweeping the entire continent and they
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:37.000]  then talk about it because it's not politically correct. You've got German police covering up
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:42.440]  crimes involving migrants, admittedly. You've got the head of the top broadcaster in Germany,
[03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:47.880]  ZDF saying, we don't report on migrant crimes, we report what the government tells us to report.
[03:44:49.320 --> 03:44:55.080]  So if you imagine just the crimes, the clones, the hamburgs, the rapes at the Swedish festival.
[03:44:56.680 --> 03:45:02.360]  Oh, and by the way, another 14 year old girl and another woman raped by migrants in Sweden
[03:45:02.360 --> 03:45:07.720]  just over the past few days, cultural enrichment intensifies. These are just the cases that we
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:14.120]  hear about. Given that there's a massive cover up, imagine all the cases that we don't hear about.
[03:45:15.400 --> 03:45:21.960]  This is absolutely astonishing. But from one form of extremism to another, you may have seen
[03:45:21.960 --> 03:45:29.240]  this on my YouTube channel. This is the 20 year old woman who lives her life as a baby. Let's roll
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:37.880]  the clip. 21 year old Jess from Florida has dedicated her life to living with her boyfriend
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:43.640]  as a baby. She says she wears diapers, but only peas in them. No poo poo. I don't know,
[03:45:43.640 --> 03:45:48.680]  like that's just too far for me. Right, because rolling around in a nappy while pissing yourself
[03:45:48.680 --> 03:45:54.040]  is perfectly within the bounds of normality. For me, there is nothing sexual about my age play
[03:45:54.040 --> 03:46:00.040]  or anything like that. Really? Is that why your YouTube header image is you with your legs spread
[03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:06.200]  wide open with the camera centered on your crotch? No, that's not sexual at all. I'll be calling me
[03:46:06.200 --> 03:46:13.240]  a pedophile. Age play is not sexually stimulating to me in any way, shape or form. Yeah, right.
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:18.680]  So it's not a sexual thing, but the official terms for what you get up to are daddy dominant
[03:46:18.680 --> 03:46:27.320]  slash little girl, adult baby diaper love, an age play, all subsets of BDSM, which for those who
[03:46:27.320 --> 03:46:33.880]  don't know stands for bondage, dominance, submission and sadomasochism. Yeah, nothing sexual about
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:40.040]  that. I think all kinds of people watch my videos for different intentions or purposes.
[03:46:40.600 --> 03:46:46.440]  Pedophiles. Jess says that living as a baby is a way of dealing with her being sexually abused
[03:46:46.440 --> 03:46:53.320]  as a child, but admits that she would probably have chosen the lifestyle anyway. Okay, two things
[03:46:53.320 --> 03:47:00.040]  here. One, the fact that adult babies are even a thing is part of the regressive left's demented
[03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:06.280]  attempt to normalize pedophilia as a legitimate alternative sexual preference. Remember this
[03:47:06.280 --> 03:47:12.920]  middle aged freak who abandoned his wife and seven kids to live as a six year old girl. You may laugh,
[03:47:12.920 --> 03:47:19.720]  but many on the left celebrated Stephanie Walsh as a brave icon for the transgender community.
[03:47:19.720 --> 03:47:26.840]  Remember Todd Nickerson, the wannabe child molester who has a regular platform with salon.com,
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:33.000]  who illustrated him talking about masturbating over a five year old girl by romanticizing it
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:39.560]  with dreamy footage of a child dancing and twirling who continue to give Nickerson a platform
[03:47:39.560 --> 03:47:45.480]  despite him admitting he would quote, engage in sex play with a child if she wanted it and
[03:47:45.480 --> 03:47:52.200]  initiated it. Because their agenda here is sabotage. It started out maybe as creative
[03:47:52.200 --> 03:47:57.400]  destruction. Let's tear it down and then rebuild society in our own image. But now it's just,
[03:47:57.400 --> 03:48:03.720]  you know what, screw rebuilding. Let's just blow it up. And secondly, Baby Jess has her coloring
[03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:11.240]  book, but coloring books aimed at adults are now a thing. They're marketed as stress relievers.
[03:48:11.240 --> 03:48:18.920]  In reality, this is one aspect of a wider trend, the infantilization of society as a whole.
[03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:24.360]  Social media has had the effect of creating this endless compulsion for validation,
[03:48:24.360 --> 03:48:30.920]  regressing us back to the mindset we had as toddlers. The baby's narcissistic need for someone
[03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:36.760]  to constantly reassure it that it exists. According to leading neuroscientist and professor
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:43.000]  of synaptic pharmacology at Lincoln College, Oxford, Lady Greenfield, social media is exacerbating
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:49.560]  short attention spans, narcissism, and the inability to empathize. All traits associated
[03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:56.760]  with infants by creating drug addicts who are so addicted to screen time that they devote zero
[03:48:56.760 --> 03:49:04.280]  effort to forming their characters in the real world. This leads to a constant state of identity
[03:49:04.280 --> 03:49:10.520]  crisis, which is why we see this explosion of young people identifying as all kinds of nebulous
[03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:18.200]  and bizarre things. We're being trapped in a state of permanent adolescence. Thanks to social media,
[03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:25.160]  young people's brains are being rewired. You've now got grown men and women walking off cliffs,
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:31.960]  trying to catch animated Pokemon characters for God's sake. You've got adults wanting to suck
[03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:38.680]  on dummies, piss in diapers, and pretend they're babies. In the decadent late stages of a society,
[03:49:38.680 --> 03:49:45.000]  bizarre and aberrant behavior becomes commonplace. So commonplace that the mass media and many on
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:52.760]  the left embrace and promote it as normal. And I found, okay, in my study, that history is cyclic,
[03:49:52.760 --> 03:50:00.360]  and everywhere in the world, you find this pattern in ancient times, that as a culture begins to
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:08.760]  decline, you have an efflorescence of transgender phenomena. That is a symptom of cultural collapse.
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:16.360]  So rather than people singing the praises of the humanitarian liberalism that allows all of these
[03:50:16.360 --> 03:50:22.520]  of these transgender possibilities to appear and to be encouraged, I would be concerned about
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:28.760]  how Western culture is defining itself to the world. As another example, a top professor of
[03:50:28.760 --> 03:50:35.400]  clinical psychiatry even said that this woman having someone pour drain cleaner in her eyes so
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:41.960]  she could become blind was an ethical way of treating her condition. Yes, we've always had
[03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:50.280]  that. Again, this is about the externalization of the vulgar. This is a deliberate program to
[03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:55.880]  brainwash everybody to infantilize our minds. We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex
[03:50:55.880 --> 03:51:02.920]  Jones show breaking news at info wars.com. Stay right there. Extendivite is more than just a
[03:51:02.920 --> 03:51:08.360]  heart tonic. Most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut and metals in the liver. And we
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:13.800]  all have a bit of both. The garlic in Extendivite has a yeast killing effect in the gut while also

[03:52:00.520 --> 03:52:03.000]  Honey, I'm really worried about our retirement funds.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:07.800]  Oh, me too. We lost so much value in the recession and the stock market. I'm worried we won't have
[03:52:07.800 --> 03:52:12.200]  enough to retire. Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold
[03:52:12.200 --> 03:52:16.840]  silver groove. He said how simple and safe it was. It's a private storage IRA and we could
[03:52:16.840 --> 03:52:22.040]  have real gold and silver in our hands. Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[03:52:22.040 --> 03:52:26.760]  Absolutely. Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build our retirement income.
[03:52:26.760 --> 03:52:31.160]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset and we would have the security of knowing we're
[03:52:31.160 --> 03:52:35.160]  protected no matter what the economy does. What do you think? I think we need to find out how to

[03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:15.240]  I fell into a burning ring of fire. I went down, down, down.
[03:54:15.240 --> 03:54:24.280]  I'll be back co-hosting with David Knight tomorrow again to recap those specials at

[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:43.880]  Infowars.com, red-linked at the top. Trump is right. Hillary stole the nomination,
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:50.360]  and she will try to steal the presidency. Once again, the establishment, the mainstream media,
[03:54:50.360 --> 03:54:57.560]  is out saying, oh my god, Donald Trump said that Hillary's gonna rig the election. What a bizarre,
[03:54:57.560 --> 03:55:04.520]  unfounded, baseless conspiracy theory. But actually, he's just voicing objectively
[03:55:04.520 --> 03:55:15.960]  provable facts. The fact that she rigged the whole primary process. We don't even need the leaked,
[03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:21.480]  you know, WikiLeaks DNC emails to tell us that. We had the New York Daily News. This was way back
[03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:27.080]  in March. Admitting the Democratic Party nomination is largely controlled by, quote,
[03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:32.360]  the desire of party bosses who don't have to take into account the expressed desire
[03:55:32.360 --> 03:55:40.040]  of Democratic voters. In other words, the voters who voted for Bernie Sanders, whose votes
[03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:46.360]  counted for nothing. Again, they asked these superdelegates, what's gonna happen if Bernie
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:53.960]  Sanders wins? They said brazenly, we're still gonna support Hillary Clinton. It was rigged from the
[03:55:53.960 --> 03:56:01.480]  very beginning. The New York Daily News, which is a left-leaning newspaper, said themselves that it
[03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:10.120]  was rigged way back in March. Again, we've got the leaked DNC emails, the Democratic Party establishment
[03:56:10.120 --> 03:56:17.720]  conspiring to choose to pre-select Hillary Clinton before the primary process even started.
[03:56:17.720 --> 03:56:25.560]  In what world is that not rigged? Trump is completely right. The fix was in from the start.
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:31.960]  But even many on the left who aren't Bernie Sanders supporters admit that. So to claim that his
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:38.680]  concerns about the election itself being rigged are a baseless conspiracy theory is completely
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:45.400]  and utterly incorrect. Once again, Trump is completely right to voice these concerns. It's
[03:56:45.400 --> 03:56:51.960]  happened before. Why wouldn't it happen again, especially given how crooked, crooked Hillary
[03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:59.000]  Clinton really is? So that's a really important article up on infowars.com. Get that, get it out
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:06.600]  to people. Continue with this narrative that Hillary is planning to rig the election. And again,
[03:57:06.600 --> 03:57:12.760]  the other aspect, what is wrong with Hillary Clinton? Is it just a tick? Is she suffering
[03:57:12.760 --> 03:57:19.960]  seizures? Is she gonna have a stroke? Does she have brain damage, this bizarre behavior, this
[03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:25.800]  this medical history attached to Hillary Clinton, these bizarre coughing fits? Again,
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:30.440]  I'm going to put all that together in a video coming up over the next couple of days. But let's
[03:57:30.440 --> 03:57:36.440]  hit on a final few news stories. We've got Corinne Gaines, Black Lives Matter's latest
[03:57:36.440 --> 03:57:45.160]  poster child, who basically abducted a child, pointed a gun at cops, shot at cops, said,
[03:57:45.160 --> 03:57:51.080]  quote, if you don't leave, I'm going to kill you. During a standoff, they shot her dead.
[03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:56.840]  She's the latest poster child for Black Lives Matter, which of course is no surprise given
[03:57:57.560 --> 03:58:04.120]  that they exalted, you know, Antonio Martin, who pointed a cop at a gun's head as an icon.
[03:58:04.120 --> 03:58:08.600]  Michael Brown, the thug who tried to grab Officer Darren Wilson's gun who charged at him.
[03:58:08.600 --> 03:58:15.480]  He's their big poster child, Alton Sterling, the convicted sex offender, who again tried
[03:58:15.480 --> 03:58:23.640]  to grab an officer's gun as he resisted arrest. We've seen yet another case of that with Corinne
[03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:29.320]  Gaines. That's their new big poster child. The racial division will continue. That's gonna wrap
[03:58:29.320 --> 03:58:33.960]  it up for this edition of the Alex Jones show. I will be back with David Knight tomorrow at 11am
[03:58:33.960 --> 03:58:41.000]  coming up tonight in For Wars Nightly News. Thanks for joining us. Breaking news at infowars.com.
