[00:00.000 --> 00:19.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones, and I come to you with grave information
[00:19.080 --> 00:22.120]  and grave developments.
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.960]  I have researched what's been happening the last seven weeks in Great Retail.
[00:26.960 --> 00:31.720]  I've researched the background of the organizations and groups that are exacerbating and creating
[00:31.720 --> 00:39.240]  a hysteria, and we've done a deep analysis of the globalist operations, and we are now
[00:39.240 --> 00:43.520]  100% clear on what's taking place and what is unfolding.
[00:43.520 --> 00:49.120]  So I'm going to lay some things out here in this first hour as calmly as I can, but I
[00:49.120 --> 00:58.520]  cannot express to you enough the level of danger and seriousness of what we are facing
[00:58.520 --> 01:02.680]  and the magnitude of what we are facing.
[01:02.680 --> 01:08.080]  We are facing a greater threat than we face from tyranny in World War II and the Cold
[01:08.080 --> 01:12.680]  War, and I'm going to lay it all out here today with Owen Schreuer, who's in studio
[01:12.680 --> 01:13.680]  back at ATX.
[01:13.680 --> 01:14.680]  I'm very near Austin.
[01:14.680 --> 01:16.400]  I'll be back in two days.
[01:16.400 --> 01:19.240]  We also have Mike Adams coming on next hour.
[01:19.240 --> 01:20.240]  We have Dr. Francis Boyle on Wednesday.
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.720]  We have a lot of other special guests, and we're going to be giving different views,
[01:24.720 --> 01:27.920]  looking at the same problem from different angles.
[01:27.920 --> 01:30.800]  So we don't get on high talking points here.
[01:30.800 --> 01:32.800]  We have a lot of great researchers, people I respect.
[01:32.800 --> 01:35.080]  We have different views and different perspectives.
[01:35.080 --> 01:36.080]  We agree on some things.
[01:36.080 --> 01:37.280]  We disagree on others.
[01:37.280 --> 01:41.800]  So let me just calmly try to lay this out.
[01:41.800 --> 01:49.280]  This is a world government martial law on a planetary scale drill.
[01:49.280 --> 01:51.240]  The virus is real.
[01:51.240 --> 01:55.120]  It does kill some people.
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.280]  We called the incredible hype and martial law that was coming more than six weeks ago.
[02:01.280 --> 02:07.800]  But just because we called it correctly that this was going to be a seismic, ultra massive
[02:07.800 --> 02:17.920]  colossal event does not mean then that we are for the hype or for the hysteria that
[02:17.920 --> 02:18.920]  you see.
[02:18.920 --> 02:24.920]  Every socialist, every communist, every globalist, every authoritarian country, Hollywood, and
[02:24.920 --> 02:36.160]  Big Tech all unified, pushing the maximum hysteria for the maximum martial law lockdowns that
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.120]  they can get.
[02:41.120 --> 02:49.040]  That response is as synthetic as the man-made virus that major universities and the Senate
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.040]  Intelligence Committee and others have said is clearly man-made.
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.120]  And it's the fact that it's man-made, number one.
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.400]  Number two, the fact that it has the HIV delivery system, that's a fact and that the virus is
[03:03.400 --> 03:12.360]  coming back is the key, the skeleton key to open any door when it comes to this story.
[03:12.360 --> 03:14.720]  It's a rosetta stone.
[03:14.720 --> 03:18.200]  So there's no focus on that.
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.040]  And the media demonizes you if you talk about that because they don't want a discussion
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.480]  of where it came from, communist China, the fact that they were working on it in Wuhan,
[03:26.480 --> 03:31.040]  and the fact that they released it as they were losing their trade war to try to take
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.240]  down the United States, working in concert with fellow traveler globalist throughout
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.880]  government, throughout corporations, and throughout academia and the media.
[03:41.880 --> 03:45.160]  And they are now all singing from the same sheet of music.
[03:45.160 --> 03:48.640]  They are all demanding national gun confiscation.
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.360]  They are all demanding interstate travel bans.
[03:54.360 --> 03:58.000]  And out of this, America will never emerge again.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.120]  This is the great test of America.
[04:01.120 --> 04:08.080]  This is a huge hysteria overblown, overdriven to try to scare the land of the free home
[04:08.080 --> 04:14.360]  of the brave into a total capitulation, monkey see monkey do after watching communist China
[04:14.360 --> 04:20.760]  and then now communist run Italy and globalist run France and globalist run Germany and
[04:20.760 --> 04:26.360]  globalist socialist run Spain, all announcing martial law and effect.
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.760]  And I can tell you, it's all over the news.
[04:28.760 --> 04:34.240]  We told you yesterday that Trump was considering announcing the tri-state ban.
[04:34.240 --> 04:36.960]  That's another piece of news I'm coming up with that I have confirmed in Connecticut
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.960]  and two other states with the interstate ban and that he may back down.
[04:40.960 --> 04:41.960]  He back down then.
[04:41.960 --> 04:44.800]  He has another press conference at 3.30 Eastern today.
[04:44.800 --> 04:45.920]  We'll be covering that.
[04:45.920 --> 04:51.080]  But you see the other countries doing it and the word is President Trump is going to announce
[04:51.080 --> 04:54.400]  that because they have set the precedent, forcing him into it.
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.560]  And if he doesn't, he hasn't responded properly.
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.040]  We'll break it all down the other side.
[04:58.040 --> 05:01.040]  Stay with us.
[05:01.040 --> 05:02.040]  Rich in Alabama.
[05:02.040 --> 05:03.040]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[05:03.040 --> 05:04.040]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.040]  Appreciate it.
[05:05.040 --> 05:06.040]  First thing.
[05:06.040 --> 05:07.040]  I love the turbo force.
[05:07.040 --> 05:10.040]  I drive a truck for a living and it's amazing.
[05:10.040 --> 05:15.560]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.280]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[05:17.280 --> 05:22.880]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours.
[05:22.880 --> 05:27.840]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and coffee and it's just, you know, at the end
[05:27.840 --> 05:30.240]  of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[05:30.240 --> 05:32.880]  I'll, you know, knock out them.
[05:32.880 --> 05:33.880]  I'm out cold.
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.840]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who did want his name on it and I said, what
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.240]  would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be?
[05:41.240 --> 05:42.240]  Is that possible?
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.280]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are
[05:46.280 --> 05:50.480]  healthy and natural that are time released and there's more money in it than anybody
[05:50.480 --> 05:55.120]  else puts in their product, so that's why turbo force has such a great effect.
[05:55.120 --> 06:17.720]  And so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[06:17.720 --> 06:25.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars.com
[06:25.400 --> 06:32.200]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:32.200 --> 06:39.600]  The date is Monday, March 16th, the year 2020 that was wanted to be a year unlike any other
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.720]  has already come out that way.
[06:41.720 --> 06:47.320]  Global stock markets continue to plunge 1000 points or so a day despite the Federal reserves
[06:47.320 --> 06:49.520]  desperate action.
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.800]  We laid out exactly how this COVID-19 would unfold.
[06:53.800 --> 07:00.640]  We laid out the monkey see monkey do of martial law in China and the obvious theatrics they
[07:00.640 --> 07:05.640]  were engaged in to create as much fear as possible than the choreographed working with
[07:05.640 --> 07:10.800]  mainstream media major institutions and other communists and socialist governments to create
[07:10.800 --> 07:16.200]  the precedent for martial law total lockdown in your houses.
[07:16.200 --> 07:24.040]  That's maximum martial law on a scale of one to 10, that's a nine and a half.
[07:24.040 --> 07:30.440]  To now criticize Trump, if he didn't create hysteria and lock things down as well, they
[07:30.440 --> 07:37.760]  would simply have the corporations and governors and media and big tech do it and then say
[07:37.760 --> 07:42.000]  that he hadn't responded when the deaths began each one they would hype up like it was a
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  million.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.080]  Stalin said one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 dies are statistic and so first lands
[07:48.080 --> 07:54.840]  it was saying 15% died and then it was 2% died and then it was 1% died.
[07:54.840 --> 08:04.840]  Clearly this is a world government planetary martial law takeover drill.
[08:04.840 --> 08:10.760]  Just because M4 is accurately with precision predicted the trajectory starting seven weeks
[08:10.760 --> 08:16.920]  ago till now and expose the man made nature of the virus and expose the fact that it's
[08:16.920 --> 08:24.720]  real danger is that it comes back because it's an HIV attack system with an HIV delivery
[08:24.720 --> 08:25.720]  system.
[08:25.720 --> 08:34.320]  HIV was man made, this is man made, we must discuss the providence, the lineage, the blood
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.960]  line of the RNA of this virus that will bring the globalist down.
[08:39.960 --> 08:45.240]  Really exposure of the fact that they developed these in bio weapon labs that Obama sold it
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.880]  to China that it was released now as a bio weapon against the West with the media and
[08:49.880 --> 08:58.840]  big tech and authoritarian regimes coordinating with total precision to blame Trump and to
[08:58.840 --> 09:00.840]  blame the UK.
[09:00.840 --> 09:08.040]  If you look at global news they praise Italy and China's and all the other globalist countries
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.720]  response but oh England's doing a terrible job even though they're very draconian and
[09:12.720 --> 09:14.640]  oh America's doing a bad job.
[09:14.640 --> 09:18.400]  It's all in the scripting.
[09:18.400 --> 09:23.080]  Now some listeners will say, well you have Mike Adams on saying you got to lock down
[09:23.080 --> 09:25.960]  and all unnecessary travel and all this to stop the spread.
[09:25.960 --> 09:30.800]  Well on those models if you believe those models though potentially millions dead, yes
[09:30.800 --> 09:35.840]  and I'm not saying it's bad to have that perspective it's good to war game in the dialectic of
[09:35.840 --> 09:45.120]  the most extreme alarmist views which if it is accurate how bad it is are reasonable or
[09:45.120 --> 09:47.320]  the other view that the virus isn't very deadly.
[09:47.320 --> 09:49.840]  None of that is in the real equation.
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.280]  That is up for debate and we'll discover in the balance and fall in some time.
[09:53.280 --> 10:01.120]  The issue is the synthetic nature of the virus, its bloodline, where it came from, its history,
[10:01.120 --> 10:06.200]  its artificiality, its syntheticness and the fact that's hidden in plain view in major
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.080]  publications like The Scientist and other major publications five years ago.
[10:11.080 --> 10:16.560]  Why is a Chimera coronavirus that's super deadly being given by North Carolina University
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.560]  to China?
[10:17.560 --> 10:19.200]  We can put all that on screen.
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.680]  So let's walk through it all and we'll get Owen Schroyer's take on this and then I have
[10:23.680 --> 10:29.720]  a massive announcement coming in the last segment of this hour, one of the biggest announcements
[10:29.720 --> 10:34.880]  ever about what we're up to and what Enforced is doing and moral decision I've made about
[10:34.880 --> 10:39.160]  the right thing to do and then Mike Adams will be joining us in the next hour.
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.400]  Owen Schroyer riding shotgun here and of course the war room is coming up today.
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.640]  You'll probably host part of that as well but he has some of the other great crew hosting
[10:46.640 --> 10:47.640]  that as well.
[10:47.640 --> 10:51.640]  David Knight on 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. every morning doing an excellent job as well.
[10:51.640 --> 10:55.440]  I was tuned into him this morning while I was exercising and he was making a lot of really
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.760]  incredibly important on-target points probably also get David to weigh in sometime in studio
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.440]  during the show tomorrow with Owen as well and again we have other experts joining us.
[11:05.440 --> 11:10.920]  We should probably get Mr. Rappaport on he's been saying it's a global government drill
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.040]  hoax from the beginning doesn't mean the virus isn't real doesn't mean it doesn't
[11:15.040 --> 11:22.040]  kill some people but the total hysteria unified and now the National Guard and troops and
[11:22.040 --> 11:26.640]  already I saw police and others practicing checkpoints here in Texas walk on a highway
[11:26.640 --> 11:34.320]  yesterday it is all unfolding right now but here's what you need to know the year and
[11:34.320 --> 11:40.320]  a half ago the UN came out and said disease X will show up in the next few years it could
[11:40.320 --> 11:48.040]  kill 100 200 million people then in November of last year just four months ago Bill and
[11:48.040 --> 11:55.800]  Melinda Gates hosted a giant drill where 65 million people died from a Corona style
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.920]  virus and I have those headlines right here again all of these can be pulled up by anybody
[12:00.920 --> 12:05.360]  that just search engines so they had all this prepared they had all this ready they had
[12:05.360 --> 12:13.520]  all this in place Bill and Melinda Gates patent the virus or a vaccine that's already
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.520]  and then there's all this hype in the movies and TV about eight about giant outbreaks that
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.120]  were already queued up and ready on Netflix and in theaters in November and December
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.560]  and January and new shows on Discovery Channel History Channel you could see the whole giant
[12:28.560 --> 12:33.760]  rollout right before I never needed to get secret Soros documents even though we got
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.400]  them to see all the TV shows and movies about race war and widespread racist right at the
[12:38.400 --> 12:42.360]  end of Obama's administration because they were considering trying to trigger a race war
[12:42.360 --> 12:47.480]  in Obama staying in office but then sure enough we got the secret documents from Antifa and
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.680]  George Soros his son funding it they were planning just that and coordinating with Hollywood
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.560]  you can see the scripting well the race war failed and Russia gate failed and Ukraine
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.440]  gate failed and so Trump was right to come out and say the media's response of total
[13:02.440 --> 13:09.800]  hysteria is a hoax that was his original response and his advisors and then Limbaugh everybody
[13:09.800 --> 13:13.640]  else came out and said this is probably as bad as the flu you know this is a bunch of
[13:13.640 --> 13:19.080]  fear mongering the left is all supporting this that was Limbaugh's cue that it was BS
[13:19.080 --> 13:24.000]  we were explaining to Trump that it was a setup that if he didn't respond at least in their
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.040]  rhetoric up front they were going to set him up for what this virus did because they've
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.000]  got other versions of it that are weaponized that they can release that it looks like have
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.520]  already been released in areas of Europe and other areas you understand it's very sophisticated
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.560]  so this is a huge operation we know it's synthetic we know it's an attack we know it's coming
[13:43.560 --> 13:49.080]  but in the fog of war you can bet and you can see and you can research that they've
[13:49.080 --> 13:54.000]  already got other versions of this ready that mutate quickly and then and then aren't deadly
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.640]  anymore they'll go through a few groups of people kill a saturated group create a panic
[13:59.640 --> 14:06.040]  but then they retrograde out and and there's also evidence that it's also a binary weapon
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.000]  that you've got to have other things in the environment or it to be triggered such as
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.720]  certain heavy metals already in the lungs and certain degraded lungs like in communist
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.480]  China the dirtiest country with absolute you know small controls on the face of the earth
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.920]  so there's a lot of data and information going into this but when we come back here's the
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.440]  big issue that we're going to be breaking down this is the end of our way of life and
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.080]  out of this if you think the Patriot Act in 9-11 took your freedoms the left tells us
[14:37.080 --> 14:41.320]  leave the borders open let folks to him would be bonnock plague drug resistant TB dozens
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.720]  of other diseases let them spread it in schools let it bankrupt our economy that's when they're
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.240]  playing clowered and pivot but now that this is here still there's no discussion about
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.720]  our physical borders that are wide open in the south it's all about how you can't leave
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.400]  your house and how you can't go to the store unless you're authorized and how you can't
[14:59.400 --> 15:06.520]  travel across state lines but Trump hasn't sealed the borders first and so Trump has
[15:06.520 --> 15:10.360]  overcorrected from saying nothing's gonna happen we're like no sir you're being set
[15:10.360 --> 15:14.800]  up which didn't start it happening we knew the scripting ahead of time understanding
[15:14.800 --> 15:19.440]  the globalist and resourcing it 100% that on everybody witnessed it here but then he's
[15:19.440 --> 15:24.920]  over compensating oh well I'll go further than in Europe I'll have a ban on interstate
[15:24.920 --> 15:30.880]  travel unless it's absolutely authorized the military taking over food distribution centers
[15:30.880 --> 15:37.520]  all of this is being announced so Trump is over compensating and if the courts go along
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.000]  with this it will set the precedent that every time there's some new little virus or something
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.880]  just like a storm coming into town everything gets locked down and then we learn the globalists
[15:46.880 --> 15:52.680]  have a plan for these compact smart cities to be these literal dome cities of the future
[15:52.680 --> 15:57.360]  who says real quote be safe from the new bio weapon of the week this is the global take

[17:28.240 --> 17:32.240]  location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system

[20:36.960 --> 20:41.960]  are running off the edge of cliffs you've got all these talk show hosts you've got pierce
[20:41.960 --> 20:47.200]  morgan saying shut all the bars down don't let people out of their houses or everybody's
[20:47.200 --> 20:53.560]  dead and that's the same thing that deblazio saying and democrat mayors are announcing
[20:53.560 --> 20:57.680]  the power to confiscate guns they're announcing you can't sell guns they're they're announcing
[20:57.680 --> 21:04.360]  you're not able to sell alcohol it's the lock down of society everything info wars always
[21:04.360 --> 21:09.800]  told you the globalist were setting up worldwide and they were going to use a bio weapon to
[21:09.800 --> 21:19.160]  do it it's how my film in game blueprint for global enslavement ends that i made in 2007
[21:19.160 --> 21:24.400]  and so they're here and you look at the globalist the authoritarians they're all using it to
[21:24.400 --> 21:30.680]  grab power they're all demanding trump do more and then when there's a hundred deaths
[21:30.680 --> 21:35.960]  a thousand deaths from this here in the united states it will all be trumps fault for not
[21:35.960 --> 21:39.200]  just telling everybody to stay in their homes for the rest of their lives even though the
[21:39.200 --> 21:45.120]  virus is now part of the environment it's mutating and it comes back in many people
[21:45.120 --> 21:50.360]  but there's no discussion of how it has an h.f.e. delivery system there's no discussion
[21:50.360 --> 21:55.680]  of the fact that it's man made and that it was in major journals in 2015 headline out
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.320]  of the scientist let's let's put that on screen over and over and over again i've got it right
[22:00.320 --> 22:06.840]  here saying why did obama allow the sale of this weaponized corona virus the communist
[22:06.840 --> 22:14.560]  chinese along with many others but that's the reality lab made corona virus triggers debate
[22:14.560 --> 22:20.080]  that's what these labs are doing everywhere but then oh the very people that are doing
[22:20.080 --> 22:24.960]  this in the labs are the very ones that stand to get all the power now over society now
[22:24.960 --> 22:31.440]  here's the key and i'm gonna go to own shroyer if you go back five years ago documents began
[22:31.440 --> 22:38.440]  to come out of google facebook and twitter and apple how they all had secret plans to
[22:38.440 --> 22:45.240]  compete with each other for their own smart cities of the future or domed cities google
[22:45.240 --> 22:51.640]  wants to build domed smart cities just type that in click images you put it on screen
[22:51.640 --> 22:56.320]  and toronto found out about the plan to just basically take over part of the city and crack
[22:56.320 --> 23:02.720]  everyone denver all of them and people are getting upset but now they're saying oh don't
[23:02.720 --> 23:07.840]  worry there's going to be bio attacks and and all these things the future you'll need
[23:07.840 --> 23:17.080]  to be in these domed cities to be safe and so people will fight to have the smart cities
[23:17.080 --> 23:22.720]  there it is minnesota was way ahead of google and planning a smart city and where it's the
[23:22.720 --> 23:28.360]  domed area where the elite live and then everybody else outside it's hit with the bio weapons
[23:28.360 --> 23:32.360]  they're actually releasing and people fight to get into the dome city with all the five
[23:32.360 --> 23:37.000]  g all the control we've got to be inoculated and all these governments in europe just signed
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.960]  executive orders for forced inoculations of billa melinda gates vaccine that you know
[23:41.960 --> 23:45.640]  they've got ready they're just waiting till you panic properly they're going to roll it
[23:45.640 --> 23:51.720]  out sorry don't have the vaccine can't fly that's why i've made the decision to oppose
[23:51.720 --> 23:57.000]  all the hysteria and the fear the only thing we have to fear is fear itself is president
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.480]  during world war two said roosevelt and that's true and so yes it's scripted yes it's manufactured
[24:03.480 --> 24:08.280]  yes it's manmade yes it does kill people yes it's got hiv delivery system doesn't mean
[24:08.280 --> 24:16.560]  it gives you hiv grades it it it has a delivery system it's airborne it's a cover for other
[24:16.560 --> 24:20.520]  attacks and as soon as we show that we get our knees for something that might kill one
[24:20.520 --> 24:26.840]  percent of people maybe as soon as we show that we hit our knees and then our response
[24:26.840 --> 24:30.800]  is to bend over and say do whatever you want to me well now you set the precedent for the
[24:30.800 --> 24:37.040]  military industrial globalist big tech pharma complex run by the chai comms as the model
[24:37.040 --> 24:40.880]  to use this as a tool of social control never wondered how the chai comms would fight back
[24:40.880 --> 24:48.200]  against taiwan and the chinese people saying no to all this you ever wondered how they
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.440]  would strike back well it's with an invisible enemy and only the state can protect you so
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.000]  yes we were right telling you all this hysteria was coming people didn't believe us six eight
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.240]  weeks ago now people are like whoa what are we doing most people I talked to aren't buying
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.480]  into this and aren't buying into the fear and see right through it though they are getting
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.240]  prepared because the financial collapse and the riots and what happens if the ebt cards
[25:13.240 --> 25:17.520]  don't get filled and the globalists are going to try to exacerbate civil unrest during this
[25:17.520 --> 25:22.680]  you can bet your boots now talk about canceling the rnc the dnc now they're gonna cancel the
[25:22.680 --> 25:26.800]  election just three weeks ago I said will they cancel the election Mike Adams said that
[25:26.800 --> 25:31.920]  as well notice this about Mike Adams I like Mike really respecting he's been dead on about
[25:31.920 --> 25:38.120]  analyzing how this would happen how the hysteria would unfold he believes in the lockdown to
[25:38.120 --> 25:44.120]  save people because potential projection show it really could be a mass killer I'm saying
[25:44.120 --> 25:49.760]  that I don't think it kills 20,000 people in the next year in the United States now
[25:49.760 --> 25:54.320]  the flu kills 35,000 or so so again why is this happening it's the way it's all been
[25:54.320 --> 25:59.680]  hyped so I think it's good to see Mike's perspective and bounce things off of that okay and I disagree
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.560]  with Limbaugh saying this isn't a big deal no this is this is this is the beginning of
[26:03.560 --> 26:08.120]  the end of everything if we bow to this and we don't respond to this right we act like
[26:08.120 --> 26:12.160]  a bunch of cowards look if you're scared of bugs and you're gonna self quarantine that's
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.640]  great most people have jobs and children and they can't and the big tech wants us to lock
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.280]  down inside the cities inside our homes and have authorization via our smart phones when
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.320]  we go out China already has that model so this is the roll out of the social credit
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.760]  score with big tech this is the 5g takeover this is the pretext to end our way of life
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.600]  forever and live austere with a small carbon footprint if we're wondering how they're gonna
[26:35.600 --> 26:40.080]  shut down people's travel if we're gonna shut down everything this is it this is the new
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.440]  dark age the globalist said they would create using a threat of bioweapons locking people
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.800]  down in smart control grid cities and then everybody else out there could just kill themselves
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.080]  all the big mega cities tax everybody and suck all the resources in globalism was never
[26:56.080 --> 27:01.240]  about unifying the world and nations together it's about destroying nations building mega
[27:01.240 --> 27:09.840]  cities on the lines of the city of Rome the Vatican and other district of criminals this
[27:09.840 --> 27:16.480]  is their official model we have cracked the code we know how to oppose it so that's why
[27:16.480 --> 27:20.720]  ladies and gentlemen we have to understand that this is the big one i'm a shroyer we
[27:20.720 --> 27:24.600]  got a minute and a half they'll be taking over next hour really appreciate your great
[27:24.600 --> 27:30.640]  work what is your analysis on what i just said you agree or disagree no alex i think
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.760]  obviously there's been a lot of mystery to this over the course of the last month and
[27:34.760 --> 27:39.640]  a half and the one thing despite all the different angles we've been covering in the commentary
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.880]  the one thing that we've all been looking at and in agreement with i think it's never
[27:43.880 --> 27:50.000]  been more clear and that is exactly this the coronavirus the coronavirus outbreak quote
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.360]  unquote is 9 11 on a global global scale it's a false flag it's to end freedom worldwide
[27:56.360 --> 28:01.600]  to get people in a state of fear and hysteria and and it'll be justified because oh you
[28:01.600 --> 28:07.800]  don't want to die from the coronavirus so i mean alex i i i think that we can try to
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.560]  figure out who's to blame or what's what's behind it who doesn't know if people just
[28:12.560 --> 28:19.480]  understand what this is on a global scale to keep you in your homes have military lockdown
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.800]  worldwide that's how we can defeat this thing not being afraid of it not buying into all
[28:24.800 --> 28:29.800]  the hype and you know alex it's tough because you don't people come at you oh you're gonna
[28:29.800 --> 28:34.440]  cause people to die because you're not being hysterical well i don't want to cause people
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.720]  to be slaves by making them hysterical so there's a i mean alex it's crazy we can try
[28:39.720 --> 28:43.320]  to discuss all the different angles but people need to know that that you've been spot on
[28:43.320 --> 28:49.560]  in force has been spot on this is a global drill 9 11 false flag style to bring in tyranny
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.760]  worldwide no doubt that's right and we come back we're going to talk about trump and his
[28:54.760 --> 29:01.920]  plan to ban interstate travel and then it comes after that heart disease is on the rise clogged

[33:26.120 --> 33:33.120]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here live on this very solemn live Monday edition you
[33:37.320 --> 33:40.400]  know when you're paying attention like I've been doing for 30 years when you've been
[33:40.400 --> 33:46.160]  on air 26 years when you've interviewed the former head of the armies bio weapons program
[33:46.160 --> 33:51.880]  the former head of the armies du program the former head of air force weapons development
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.880]  probably 50 times the head of heart on air I'm not bragging folks when you've interviewed
[33:58.880 --> 34:04.600]  the author of the US biological weapons treaty and world law probably 50 60 times when you've
[34:04.600 --> 34:11.600]  interviewed people from the entire spectrum of what is the deep state telling you what's
[34:13.560 --> 34:18.640]  going on and then you read billa malinda gates and you read the UN the club of Rome and you
[34:18.640 --> 34:24.840]  see them saying 20 years ago we will use bio weapons and the threat of man made releases
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.240]  or natural pandemics to bring in world government and we're going to build dome cities where
[34:29.240 --> 34:33.200]  the elites live and everybody else lives outside of them and then we're going to depopulate
[34:33.200 --> 34:40.200]  everybody using the microbes the queen of england's husband says that in statements okay
[34:41.320 --> 34:47.640]  so bill gates gets up at 10 TV 12 years ago and he goes we need to save the earth carbons
[34:47.640 --> 34:54.320]  the problem no toxic waste GMO nuclear weapons the problem and he says we need to reduce
[34:54.320 --> 34:59.400]  the number of people or the carbon and he does the equation and it's people to zero
[34:59.400 --> 35:04.880]  and everybody laughs they teach eugenics they teach the ruling class that they're better
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.200]  than everybody and that there's too many people they've got to get rid of us well the public
[35:09.200 --> 35:15.240]  does act dumb and lazy and has drunk the kool-aid and I'm not defending what billa malinda gates
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.520]  and all them are doing I am morally have a responsibility I had a chance to join them
[35:20.520 --> 35:26.000]  I had the kiss was your group in front of john harman the head of the kiss is your group
[35:26.000 --> 35:33.000]  try to hire me the guy was unbelievable and I had others do that as well because there's
[35:34.680 --> 35:40.480]  just so arrogant but I have witnesses to this ladies and gentlemen so when they come to
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.640]  you because I've had other private meetings are off record I haven't violated those confidences
[35:44.640 --> 35:48.120]  they they talked about actual crimes then I would I would violate the confidence but
[35:48.120 --> 35:53.960]  I have to be able to talk to these people and I've been up in the high rises with top people
[35:53.960 --> 35:56.960]  and they and this is how they get everybody to join them listen you're an elitist just
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.200]  because you know all this because you understand this and you have such a grasp you can be one
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.080]  of our top managers I mean look Pachennik's not really one of them but he's been at the
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.840]  CFR and a globalist and run operations and Alex you ought to be the head of intelligence
[36:10.840 --> 36:14.760]  why you came up with this you know this plan that's just that's just how they patch you
[36:14.760 --> 36:20.760]  on the head folks and it's okay but but that's how they get people to join this is flattering
[36:20.760 --> 36:27.760]  so so I've been up in the ivory towers 50 stories up and I've had them say everything
[36:28.240 --> 36:33.920]  will be taken care of fox news show the book deals you'll think my wife's hot she'd like
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.080]  to bang you right now okay that's yeah you want to bang my wife you can bang her right
[36:39.080 --> 36:45.120]  now to sign the paperwork okay I have it's just like Al Pacino and devil's advocate
[36:45.120 --> 36:51.640]  let me tell you just like that okay so I've been to the top of the stinking pyramid folks
[36:51.640 --> 36:58.280]  and it stinks so I'm not joining them and they've all run to their bunkers that I told
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.400]  you 20 years ago about their underground bunkers and the private air scripts and the weapons
[37:04.400 --> 37:07.320]  and that they don't even trust their own security people they shouldn't there's people hate
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.640]  them so they now literally have robot guns that pop up with 50 cows that these guys have
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.800]  video game controllers or AI that kills anybody that crosses the line they've got minefields
[37:17.800 --> 37:22.440]  on their private property they've got little villages that they finance that have locals
[37:22.440 --> 37:28.240]  that you know produce wine and food and they've got all these self-contained deals they all
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.040]  hauled ass let me tell you I did just read about this in a newspaper later I was in Hollywood
[37:34.040 --> 37:40.000]  then I'm gonna go to Owen and then I'm just so much to cover here I was in Hollywood
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.880]  and I was going to see the studios of James Cameron and I was out there I was invited
[37:45.880 --> 37:51.280]  there and he was gonna come up with all these hologram movie theaters and everything else
[37:51.280 --> 37:58.440]  and I was talking to one of these big producers and he's like yeah he goes James Cameron isn't
[37:58.440 --> 38:03.960]  really into movies anymore he just moved up New Zealand and he's got a big ship in case
[38:03.960 --> 38:09.240]  that goes down because the Navy the rights office searching for the Titanic no it's his
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.980]  escape deal because he was let in on the plan to exterminate everybody and Bill Joy wrote
[38:14.980 --> 38:21.280]  about it in a wire magazine 20 years ago as well 21 years ago now so why the future
[38:21.280 --> 38:29.080]  doesn't need us they're telling us ladies and gentlemen that they think there's too
[38:29.080 --> 38:32.840]  many people and they're going to get rid of us and then they have a disease X that's
[38:32.840 --> 38:36.840]  a coronavirus drill two years ago year and a half ago then they have a tabletop four
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.880]  months ago of wiping out 65 million and then after all this fear then you see the hysteria
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.960]  in China that's real people dying but a bunch of over dramatization and people being gassed
[38:46.960 --> 38:51.640]  and people being shot and welded into their homes a real nightmare science fiction movie
[38:51.640 --> 38:56.640]  just like we saw in all the movies to initiate the fear and the stampede to end our way of
[38:56.640 --> 39:03.040]  life right as all this work from home virtual reality stuff comes out and now they're going
[39:03.040 --> 39:07.680]  to launch all the work from home and collapse all the civilization that we've had except
[39:07.680 --> 39:13.960]  in the Dome cities that you have to opt into their rules their inoculations their 5G their
[39:13.960 --> 39:23.200]  6G their control we have norm Paterson line we're going to go to norm Patis in just a
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.120]  moment I don't want him to get to our big announcement till we come back but I wanted
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.640]  him to just tell you what his federal sources high level and state sources are saying as
[39:31.640 --> 39:38.320]  they prepare tri-state martial law and the lockdown of everything just where he's at
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.800]  then we'll come back with a big announcement Owen shroyer will be riding shotgun in to
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.440]  the next hour Mike Adams is coming up a host a little bit in the next hour because I want
[39:46.440 --> 39:52.480]  to talk to Mike about this as well but norm Patis this really is from your legal position
[39:52.480 --> 39:56.000]  you thought I was overstating martial law a few days ago but you're saying looking at
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.040]  this that's what we're facing it appears to be I mean yesterday afternoon I got a call
[40:01.040 --> 40:04.480]  out of the blue from someone who's been in touch with somebody in the White House legal
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.760]  council's office to say that President Trump was actively considering a 30 day travel ban
[40:09.760 --> 40:14.800]  and that the legal call out office was pushing back is unlawful in the evening press conference
[40:14.800 --> 40:19.280]  it didn't happen there's another press conference today so let's see what does happen and about
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.200]  two hours ago I got a call from somebody well placed in the Connecticut National Guard to
[40:23.200 --> 40:29.920]  say that it would not be surprising to see a tri-state that is New York New Jersey Connecticut
[40:29.920 --> 40:36.880]  lockdown within within 24 to 48 hours I've received another call since I last communicated
[40:36.880 --> 40:41.680]  with you from a position in a hospital in northern Manhattan to say that they are becoming
[40:41.680 --> 40:48.320]  overwhelmed at this point with the cases that they're having and this day they clear the
[40:48.320 --> 40:52.000]  city that nothing good is going to be happening there for a while so I mean also and then you
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.360]  look at the op-ed piece that by Cuomo this morning in the New York Times basically asking the president
[40:57.360 --> 41:06.720]  to mobilize military resources to transform otherwise non-hospital facilities in the hospital
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.920]  facilities the kids at Columbia University have been asked to leave their dorms the dormitories
[41:11.920 --> 41:16.320]  at Columbia are right next to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital on the upper west side
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.680]  so you start to connect all these dots and it looks like there is a tsunami coming and it's
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.240]  pretty terrifying as I sit here and let's be clear when you declare martial law you get it set up
[41:28.240 --> 41:34.160]  and beta tested first then you trigger it we first reported five weeks ago six weeks ago
[41:34.160 --> 41:41.760]  that secret martial law female emergency had already been set up so again Trump didn't want to
[41:41.760 --> 41:47.040]  cause a panic we'll talk about the dialectic when we come back though because they basically have
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.360]  forced him to do this on the surface but it doesn't matter whether it's president Trump or who's
[41:51.360 --> 41:58.640]  in power it's our bill of rights it's our constitution we can't allow the system or a communist country
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.240]  to have this big freak out we don't know the truth of what really happened and then now there's a few
[42:04.240 --> 42:11.680]  thousand deaths in europe or whatever and so we're supposed to totally lock down our civilization
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.640]  trump is set to have a press conference at 230 central 330 eastern we're going to come back get
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.440]  i'll insure your take on this we'll do another this segment and then one more with this announcement
[42:22.160 --> 42:27.760]  in to the next hour then i want to talk about this face-to-face uh with mike adams and his
[42:27.760 --> 42:33.360]  perspective once i make my announcement i'm going to get mike adams take on this as well info

[47:22.480 --> 47:23.840]  the year is 2020
[47:23.840 --> 47:34.320]  March 16th and the entire world is being incrementally locked down and put into house arrest
[47:35.040 --> 47:44.160]  partial law except as we speak in turkey and in north africa and other areas islamic leaders
[47:44.160 --> 47:51.360]  have launched giant multi-million man invasion forces overrunning the borders of southern europe
[47:51.360 --> 47:58.400]  and the balkans and the left is saying let them in but they're saying governor deblazio
[47:59.360 --> 48:05.040]  and here's morgan they say they want you locked in your houses schools lockdown
[48:06.080 --> 48:13.520]  restaurants lockdown gyms lockdown but don't worry the border all stays wide open no borders no wall
[48:13.520 --> 48:22.720]  no us at all meanwhile over in communist china this thing popped up they say in november it's
[48:22.720 --> 48:30.880]  clearly man-made they create all of this hysteria who knows what the truth is but communist china now
[48:30.880 --> 48:35.120]  the model of world government the model of surveillance the model of social credit scores
[48:35.120 --> 48:43.760]  the model of globalists directed tyrant directed ai they are being praised for killing people at
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.880]  checkpoints and welding them into their homes and shutting down whole cities for months but now
[48:48.880 --> 48:54.240]  suddenly they're fine even though chinese citizens say folks are still dying now that it's moved on
[48:54.240 --> 49:00.720]  it's no longer a woonan virus now it's just covid 19 and china's good and it's america's fault and
[49:00.720 --> 49:07.760]  it just moves on because the globalist psychologists using television the last 60 years lowered the
[49:07.760 --> 49:12.320]  attention span for the average american or average westerner average personnel on the earth
[49:12.320 --> 49:25.840]  from 15 minutes to 7.4 seconds 7.4 seconds it's no longer the woonan virus it's the covid 19 so
[49:25.840 --> 49:32.640]  i prayed about this the last few days i really concentrated on it and it's the right thing to
[49:32.640 --> 49:38.480]  do intellectually scientifically historically but most importantly at a gut level spiritual level
[49:40.720 --> 49:45.520]  i know how the president got maneuvered into overreacting because he underreacted we said
[49:45.520 --> 49:50.480]  they're going to use that against him like adams i think gave the extreme end of how we could respond
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.200]  i think it's reasonable for him to have that view i he's a smart guy he certainly predicted the
[49:55.200 --> 50:00.480]  trajectory so did we and others we know what we're talking about but as you know we've been more
[50:00.480 --> 50:06.080]  moderate in this because the other danger is never coming out of this and that having new
[50:06.080 --> 50:11.120]  viruses all the time that are like weather reports of storms coming in where society's locked down
[50:11.120 --> 50:17.840]  and that's the globalist model for forced inoculations and for gun confiscation and for
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.560]  not being able to leave your homes and smartphones like china says is the model the
[50:22.560 --> 50:27.120]  track where you go what you do to make sure you're authorized they're going to use viruses
[50:27.120 --> 50:33.440]  and other bio weapons as the way to end freedom depopulate us and so because forced inoculation
[50:33.440 --> 50:40.960]  is where this is leading first it's gonna block some flights that it's lock some transport and then
[50:40.960 --> 50:45.760]  shut down schools and shut down bars and shut down restaurants and shut down gyms and shut down malls
[50:45.760 --> 50:53.360]  because we're going to a global financial reset and then they suspend the election
[50:54.400 --> 51:00.560]  so when i do this it's not because it's president trump i like president trump the global is
[51:00.560 --> 51:05.440]  definitely hating but they've maneuvered him into this hobson choice this rock in a hard place
[51:05.440 --> 51:13.200]  the movable object comes in the unstoppable force because if he doesn't respond they'll
[51:13.200 --> 51:18.160]  just trigger riots and other crises and the media will trigger hysteria either he comes in
[51:18.160 --> 51:24.400]  with the clamp down or the globalist do it and brush him aside and make him where he's irrelevant
[51:25.200 --> 51:29.520]  the left celebrated it this will bring down america this will bring down trump we said trump
[51:29.520 --> 51:34.720]  look out five six weeks ago they're setting you up we were absolutely right but where mike adams
[51:34.720 --> 51:40.480]  and i diverged some and that's good for debate we're not a cult is that now the other end of this
[51:40.480 --> 51:44.720]  in the dialectic we have to push back towards what's more reasonable in the balancing act
[51:46.240 --> 51:50.720]  so here we are so that's why i am announcing this exclusively with norm patis i was already
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.600]  thinking about what i was going to do how i was going to oppose this just to point out our rights
[51:55.600 --> 52:00.640]  and have some pushback doesn't mean i hate the president doesn't mean i even think he's wrong
[52:00.640 --> 52:06.720]  on every front but we have to not just tell mel if all the cows are running off the cliff
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.680]  maybe a few cows could walk over here and maybe not run off of it and so i've talked to our audience
[52:11.680 --> 52:15.600]  i've run into a lot of people uh when i was going to take a few days off outside austin
[52:15.600 --> 52:20.640]  they're all just we think it's a fear-mongering hoax and that the virus is real but they're
[52:20.640 --> 52:26.160]  using to take control everyone sees the left pushing it seizing on it celebrating it using
[52:26.160 --> 52:32.480]  it for gun confiscation force inoculation and so because of that i will not stand by when we had
[52:32.480 --> 52:38.000]  600 000 die from the spanish flu they didn't do any of this then and our borders are still wide open
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.400]  so because of that to illustrate this and have a larger platform to do it that's why we're making
[52:42.400 --> 52:46.080]  this announcement norm patis please make the announcement of what we're going to do what
[52:46.080 --> 52:51.440]  we're going to file give the president today or tomorrow or whenever uh declares this interstate
[52:51.440 --> 52:56.640]  travel ban violating the constitution and citizens rights of we the people while the borders are
[52:56.640 --> 53:01.920]  wide open my cat that will also be coming up to break that down and give us his take on it as well
[53:01.920 --> 53:08.080]  as dr frances boil but uh again going to norm patis constitutional lawyer make the announcement place
[53:09.040 --> 53:15.520]  we have drafted a lawsuit styled alex jones versus donald trump et al naming a number of
[53:15.520 --> 53:22.240]  trump's cabinet officials um in the event that uh president trump announces an interstate travel ban
[53:22.240 --> 53:28.160]  or something like it uh we will go immediately into a district of columbia court and ask for
[53:28.160 --> 53:33.200]  injunctive and declaratory relief in other words a ruling from a judge that the action is unlawful
[53:33.200 --> 53:39.040]  and in order from the judge barring implementation of if that judge rejects our claim we'll go to the
[53:39.040 --> 53:43.520]  dc court of appeal if that court rejects our claim we will seek a hearing in the united
[53:43.520 --> 53:50.560]  states supreme court in our view while the covet 19 crisis does present a real and present danger
[53:50.560 --> 53:55.760]  to public health there is also something significant at stake and that is our fundamental freedoms
[53:55.760 --> 54:02.000]  and rights as americans the country has weathered many storms ranging from world war to other
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.280]  epidemics i think of polio in the fifties um but we've never once resorted to an abandonment of
[54:07.280 --> 54:12.720]  constitutional principles so alex i think you may be posting this online i'm not sure the rid is
[54:12.720 --> 54:18.720]  drafted um the paperwork's ready to go um we simply await an order from the president and then we
[54:18.720 --> 54:24.560]  hope to be first in court to challenge it yes one of our great writers either don salazar kit
[54:24.560 --> 54:29.280]  daniels is going to be writing an article about this and we'll post this video once we're not live
[54:29.920 --> 54:33.600]  or we'll still be live but they'll they'll clip it out and put it up the next hour or so that'll
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.720]  be at info wars dot com and we're on the same page about this it's this stampede the president's
[54:38.720 --> 54:44.480]  original instincts to say the media hype was a hoax not the virus but the hysteria was a hoax
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.720]  but then he went too far so i said hey he needs to at least match their rhetoric but when it goes
[54:50.720 --> 54:56.000]  into pure action you see all the authoritarians licking their lips as a constitutional lawyer
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  one of the top ones out there and talking to other scholars at the federalist society and others
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.840]  what are your main concerns as a citizen norm patis we have a government a federal government
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.040]  of limited powers the states have general police powers to take care of our needs and health education
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.680]  welfare and safety but to say limited powers on the federal level means that when the federal
[55:15.680 --> 55:21.280]  government acts in derogation or in against fundamental rights such as the right to interstate
[55:21.280 --> 55:26.400]  travel it has to do so for compelling reasons that would survive strict scrutiny in other words
[55:27.040 --> 55:32.480]  its reasons has to be so strong and its method of doing so it has to be so narrowly tailored that
[55:32.480 --> 55:38.400]  it does not unnecessarily infringe on our rights an interstate travel ban or something like a
[55:38.400 --> 55:45.040]  lockdown in our homes is unprecedented in united states history one of the few amendments that
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.760]  has not been litigated in our history is the third amendment the amendment that prohibits us
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.960]  from being required to quarter the king's soldiers or the government soldiers in our home this is
[55:54.960 --> 56:00.080]  the flip side of the third amendment it's requiring us to remain in our homes absent government
[56:00.080 --> 56:05.920]  permission that i think is intolerable as a matter of law and creates a horrible precedent
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.840]  there will be other catastrophes there will be other crises other turning points in american
[56:11.840 --> 56:17.360]  history we've had many of them but we've never resorted to such dire means that's right stay
[56:17.360 --> 56:21.600]  there so we're going to come back to the government norm norm we're going to come back to you because
[56:21.600 --> 56:26.400]  i want you to be able to not debate but have a discussion with mike adams and see what his
[56:26.400 --> 56:30.560]  take is on this because he's been calling for shutting down all unnecessary travel period
[56:32.160 --> 56:37.600]  and i see his point but we haven't proven how deadly this virus is it came out of china
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.240]  since when did the authoritarians set the precedent of how we respond or how we behave
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.200]  when over a million and a half people it's estimated died in the civil war so that black
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.400]  people would have their rights well how about we all get our rights and you know don't capitulate
[56:52.400 --> 56:58.000]  to this one it's a lab made virus that came out of wuhan and we're not even supposed to call it
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.120]  wuhan now folks remember too it's going to take money to do this and to fight back for all our
[57:03.120 --> 57:07.040]  rights and they're trying to shut us down as you see lying about us demonizing us all over the

[57:53.200 --> 57:59.840]  in recorded history the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil
[57:59.840 --> 58:07.360]  war borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged the world is going to change
[58:07.360 --> 58:12.880]  and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong
[58:12.880 --> 58:19.680]  when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could be gone in an instant and
[58:19.680 --> 58:27.040]  grocery stores could be empty in three days having storable foods and the ability to purify water
[58:27.040 --> 58:32.880]  will give you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others

[1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:27.040]  ladies and gentlemen we are go we are broadcasting worldwide mic adams is up to me here for the
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:32.800]  rest of the hour and we're gonna have o and shroyer in the atx i'm a great co-host in the wings
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:40.080]  loaded for repair we have norm paddus constitutional lawyer here if you just joined us trump we
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:45.600]  confirmed the federal society was considering declaring interstate martial law banning interstate
[1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:51.360]  travel something like adams has called for here um and and i thought that trump wasn't having a
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:55.920]  strong enough response uh five weeks ago six weeks ago that they would demonize him for that
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:00.480]  pain him into a corner when the virus did kill people uh and and and then try to remove his
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:05.040]  presidency they would just declare martial law through the corporations and the companies
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:11.600]  and the local school boards and just basically make trump redundant this is a deep state emergency
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:16.960]  using our domestication using the fact that we're unhealthy on average using the fact that we are
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.600]  dependent on strung out supply chains to use the global bureaucracy and the technocracy and you
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:28.880]  think it's bad wait till we're totally in the grid to lock us down in our homes and throw trump
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.720]  off their back like a dog throwing a flea off so my analysis my gatham's analysis dr france's
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:41.120]  will's analysis that trump had to come in strong is true politically for him but till we come to
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:46.320]  the question dan we do dan we don't trump doesn't act strong he's removed clearly then you get the
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:53.600]  leftist as president so i'm taking the moral high ground here it was the only thing i know i can do
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:02:01.040]  do it's the right thing to do and saying if they come right out with martial law while the borders
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:06.560]  are still open and while the chai comms are like the boss directing how we should do it and there's
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:11.520]  no discussion of where the virus came from or how it's mutating i'm not going to get to the next
[1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:15.680]  point of forced inoculations and gun confiscation which europe's already passed emergencies to
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:20.160]  confiscate guns uh and to do forced inoculations and and the democrats are saying they're going
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:24.880]  to do it so they're licking their lips we've got to if trump goes too far over we've got to have
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:29.920]  somebody put the brakes on it that doesn't mean my lawsuit is going to stop all this hysteria it
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:35.920]  means somebody's got to just add a little friction going down the slide so that we talk about the
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:40.480]  bill of rights and constitution the fact this has never been done not with millions getting the polio
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:45.520]  that was 600 000 dying from the swine flu here in the u.s millions dying in the civil war so black
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:53.520]  folks had you know got their rights but now all of our rights are lost on the backs of this situation
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:58.160]  so out of the gates we'll have the latest coming up next segment on the virus on the trajectory
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:03.760]  mike's been dead on about the hysteria dead on about the death rates uh i really respecting i'm
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:09.680]  just simply saying in a dialectic i'm not trying to create a dialectic everything is a dialectic
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:14.560]  you've got mike over here on the one end which he's really agreeing with the communist chinese
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:18.960]  level control and i i'm not saying the communist chinese i'm saying that's where they are and
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.200]  then you've got us saying trump wasn't acting enough but we got to watch where it came from and
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:27.280]  that they got tricks up their sleeves and you had trump over here saying everything's fine he said no
[1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:34.400]  no no that's not the response so i'm more in the middle of this mike is over here uh and i understand
[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:39.760]  why he's there mike adams give us a few minute statement on this and i want to bring norm paterson
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.400]  mike adams all right thanks thanks for having me on it's going to be a very fascinating discussion
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:49.680]  you and i do diverge on this uh i'll lay out my position here uh my pandemic projection models
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:55.200]  that we first talked about on your show weeks ago have been tracking perfectly with a number of deaths
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:58.800]  that we're now seeing in the united states and what those models showed is that if trump didn't
[1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:02.800]  really lock things down he would be facing literally hundreds of thousands of deaths in
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:09.120]  america by this summer and that is still largely on track to take place and i think that would end
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:16.080]  the trump presidency so my take right now alex is that trump has not gone far enough he's not
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:22.800]  going too far he has not overreacted if anything in my assessment president trump has underreacted
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:27.520]  he does need to close the border immediately with the u.s military that's got to be first
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:32.640]  but he should have stopped domestic flights weeks ago no later than march first in fact
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:39.520]  it's already too late to prevent hospitals from being overrun mass death happening in cities like
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:44.240]  new york city that is now on track it is unstoppable it's going to happen in the next few weeks
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:49.680]  seattle probably a week later san francisco boston the dc area a few weeks later you're
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:54.480]  going to see mass death and hospitals on the state of on the verge of near collapse in this
[1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:58.640]  country very very soon and remember all right listen i want to lay this out i want to lay
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:03.040]  this out next segment with you because here's here's the thing like i respect you and and i've
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:08.880]  and i've had you on a ton and i'm not disagreeing with you i'm saying the chai comms hyping it the
[1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:14.560]  left all wanting a giant clamp down they're licking their lips uh i understand they want to set
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:20.480]  trump up so he's got to be strong or they'll be able to remove him but the trajectories of the models
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:26.640]  are hundreds of thousands dead on the low end 2.16 million on the high end
[1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:32.640]  yeah yeah that's that's real those are real numbers and i think it ends trump's presidency if he
[1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:37.520]  doesn't take immediate action yeah but we don't know the accurate number on the death rate of the
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.520]  virus i know you're using a low end number to show that but how do we know it's not much lower
[1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:48.080]  well first of all we now see that it's settling around 5.7 percent according to you know not
[1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:52.000]  just the wto but numbers coming out of italy are very high and the thing that people aren't
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:58.800]  remembering alex is that america has very high rates of obesity and pharmaceutical use both of
[1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:04.480]  those are cofactors for higher mortality rates we could be looking at a higher than 6 percent
[1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:09.760]  mortality rate in the united states and you really can't have a functioning economy if you start to
[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:15.680]  have millions of people die off so we have to stop this it's just a question of how many people do
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:22.800]  you want to see die before we stop it and shut it down i'm not look so i have the greatest respect
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:28.080]  we'll break this down when norm paddus leaves in a moment you're scaring me because i i want to
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:37.680]  believe that that that that that we can stop this and and the un all of them they want these bubble
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:42.080]  cities we always do they use bio weapons what are we gonna do when they do a force inoculations
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:45.920]  you know they're already getting that ready mike yeah well i'm not taking a force inoculation
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:50.080]  i'm not giving up my second amendment but i tell you what trump could use this martial law to go
[1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:53.840]  arrest all the deep state traders while they're locked in their homes you know what i mean there
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:59.200]  there are some ways that trump could use this to restore our constitutional republic there's a lot
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:03.280]  of leftist i want you to talk about that at the bottom of the hour i want you to have the floor
[1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:08.080]  on that i'm gonna be watching bottom of the hour let's bring norm paddus in norm this is like a
[1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:12.240]  science fiction horror movie i sure as hell hope mike adams is wrong but then it almost makes me
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.520]  feel guilty about the file this lawsuit but just gut level if the president you know does all this
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:23.520]  that's just not how america works we didn't do this before no i mean the projections i think
[1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:29.040]  mike may be right i mean i think the i mean i'd be death the rate the death rate may be overstated
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:33.440]  because we've done so few tests that we don't know how many people actually have it and have
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:39.680]  been asymptomatic or with mild symptoms but what regardless of whether it's two three or five percent
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:43.840]  um it's still going to be a shocking number of deaths i think from my perspective as a
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:48.720]  constitutional lawyer i want to make sure that the prophylactic measures aren't worse than the
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:54.400]  worse than the disease obviously i hope no one i know dies i hope i don't i hope you don't my heart
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:59.280]  goes out to those who do but we've had a republic for several hundred years that was based on the
[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:04.320]  concept of limited government the federal government's role was to exercise moral suasion
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:10.880]  and to provide the state with the resources the states need to coordinate activity i think the
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:16.800]  response should be a state law response that may sound that may be naive but my fear is exactly the
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:21.600]  thing that mike suggested and that is that if you give the government this power it can use it any
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:26.720]  which way it wants now we may like mike may like the fact that it's the that martial laws used to
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:33.840]  take out deep state operative um i cherish dissent and and and a wild cacophony of viewpoints i will
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:41.040]  concede that my view that is the luxury of free speech may be a luxury in a time where a national
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:46.000]  emergency but it's a luxury that we've always afforded and every time we've primed it back
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.880]  whether it be with the internment of japanese in the second world war whether it be the red
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:56.240]  scares at the time of the first world war whether it be the anti labor injunction to the late 19th
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:02.880]  century we're the big tech censorship or the big tech right now that's the analog but in the past
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:08.720]  we've regretted it i think in the future we'll regret it i do not want to give the power to
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:15.440]  determine what i can and cannot do to a governmental or digital overlord norm as i norm as soon as
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:20.000]  trump gives his press conference at 230 central please be on standby at the end of this show
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.880]  ordering the war room on what we're going to do i'll be here as well if we file this that's all

[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.920]  i am going to ask mike a few questions and then i want him to get into what he's talking about
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.760]  martial law go after the deep state they were going to put us into martial law they were
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:45.840]  going to trigger civil unrest they already brought us into a form of martial law outside of the

[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:14.000]  this morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.560]  this right now the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want me to say six

[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:28.720]  food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having discussions
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.440]  with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just saying we're
[1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:37.360]  done because people aren't going to take food orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.280]  money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under

[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:06.320]  hey mr johns appreciate it first thing i love the turbo force i drive truck for a living and it's
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:12.000]  amazing coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end but that turbo force is amazing
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:17.120]  how is turbo force different than coffee all right i'll tell you what it's sustainable
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:23.440]  anywhere from uh eight ten hours i don't feel the jitters like i do drink and coffee and it's
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:28.400]  just you know at the end of the day i don't need anything to go to bed i'll you know i'll pop a
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:33.600]  knockout to my mouth cold well that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:39.840]  on it and i said what would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible that's good
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:44.000]  and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.120]  are time released and there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product so that's
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:53.760]  why turbo force has such a great effect and so i really appreciate you and i'm glad that you like
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:14:15.680]  turbo force you're listening to the alex jones show welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm alex
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:21.520]  jones your host coming to you from the road old shroyer is in the atx studio outside austin
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:26.080]  self-quarantining he said it was coming months ago he's out there self-quarantining mike adams
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:34.080]  naturalnews.com look i go back to this he came to the word the chai comms say it's a man made virus
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:40.160]  they create hysteria they use the drones they weld people in their houses then the communists now run
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.840]  italy does the same thing now france now germany now spain they all want to clamp down they're on
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:50.880]  the verge of being overthrown and then now it comes here we got 60 something deaths you do the
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:56.400]  math on the worst equations okay millions dead but then when they lock everything down it doesn't
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:03.920]  kill millions it kills 10 000 well then the police states the savior and everybody forgets the hysteria
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:09.920]  and all the ptsd from the zombie movies and people fighting over the toilet paper and then we just
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:14.960]  never come out of this mike adams and then every time there's a new novel virus everything locks down
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:19.520]  this is the perfect plan for authoritarians and then they say oh we have the new bubble cities
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:23.760]  that google and everybody's racing to build uh where they go oh we'll protect you in these bubble
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:28.720]  cities they've been secretly preparing them for 10 years announced them five years ago this is the
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:34.240]  whole new world order model mike of using viruses to lock everything down and to come with forced
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:41.200]  inoculation so europe's signing executive orders for forced inoculation and so that's coming that's
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:46.480]  the next leg of this that you can't travel unless you've taken the coronavirus vaccine that bill
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:51.600]  gates already has souped up so they drilled disease x a few years ago then they had the tabletop
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.640]  exercise of 65 million dead four months ago and they got all these movies and tv shows and
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:02.240]  netflix programs about this happening coming out right in december and january the programming
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:07.200]  is everywhere do you agree that this is released by the chai comms and the globalists to bring down
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:11.360]  civilization i'm not disagreeing it might not kill a bunch of people but the whole synthetic
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:18.000]  choreographed nature it's like watching uh olympic level ice skating it's so choreographed well
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.720]  these are these are super valid points that you're making and also that norm made as well
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:27.760]  and i think you should file that that emergency injunction attempt or whatever the proper name
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:32.080]  is for it because i think this does need to be challenged because we need to see what is going
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:36.400]  to be the structure of our society so i hope you do file it i'm just saying that we can't change
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:42.400]  the laws of cause and effect so every day that trump delays halting domestic travel for example
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:46.880]  locking down the border issuing an emergency lockdown order especially in the northeast every
[1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:54.720]  day that he delays may cost 10 000 lives or 25 000 lives later this summer every day will be precious
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:17:01.840]  and i believe alex that in in hindsight it will be said that trump acted too slowly not too aggressively
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:08.000]  and here's the question if we want to have just a completely let's just say open free society
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:14.480]  everybody can continue to move without any regard for this then we're going to have a very sharp
[1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:19.520]  peak of infections instead of flattening the infection curve we will compress the infection
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:25.120]  curve to a very short period of time it will go nationwide very quickly within less than 60 days
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:31.280]  the hospitals will collapse so that's the pro-freedom scenario hospitals collapse millions die
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:36.000]  if that's what we're willing to accept in order to say that you cannot infringe upon our right
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.600]  to fly commercially then so be it i mean i'm not actually here to to make that judgment i'm just
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:49.600]  presenting what happens if we allow open movement to take place then millions will die so so what the
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:54.880]  country wants to do with that is up to trump and it's up to attorneys like norm who who knows what
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:58.560]  he's talking about and he understands civil liberties and i and you know i'm a patriot too
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:03.360]  i'm just explaining what happens because we can't change cause and effect that's my take alex
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:08.160]  mike mike i hear what you're saying but i'm gonna go back to this we saw them hyping at six seven
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:12.240]  weeks ago we said it was gonna be really huge here we said stuff will get locked down here people
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:17.040]  said we were crazy we told limbaugh and the republicans four weeks ago knock it off guys
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:22.320]  you're only gonna hurt trump he needs to respond at least in rhetoric that's right up front but by
[1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:26.080]  not responding with rhetoric then it makes it look like he didn't get ready and let the left
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:31.120]  begin to set him up now they're panicking because he's getting hardcore they're going don't block
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:37.280]  flights so now they're going the other direction uh this should not be a political issue i'm just
[1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:42.160]  simply saying we know that during a pandemic people that make it to the hospital that are
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:47.760]  already super sick become the body of people they have to then test on who survives so that
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:52.560]  always makes it look like a higher number of dying than actually are and i think that's a well known
[1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:57.360]  uh thing out there so i'm not denying math i'm not denying science i'm not denying that a lot of
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:03.760]  americans are really out of shape and run down and eating crappy food uh and that and certainly
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:08.800]  they admit there's other strains now we first broke that you broke that uh in in iran and in
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:14.400]  idly and a lot of weird crap going on uh it's just all i'm saying is go back to it being manmade go
[1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:20.720]  back to it having hiv delivery system we need to be forcing a discussion about that so the globalist
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:26.000]  that released this i think you agree this has been released on purpose get in trouble and then
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.040]  can't just always keep release this and then take control of the world economy and system does that
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:36.400]  make sense you yeah and actually you hit upon something that is the the big solution and trump
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:42.240]  hasn't even mentioned this and that is nutrition it's the antivirals if the entire population
[1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:48.000]  we're taking vitamin c and vitamin d and eating antiviral foods and herbs and minerals and so on
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:53.840]  then this virus would have very little capability to spread across america you see america's health
[1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:58.640]  is compromised and that's what's leading to these discussions about lockdowns and and flight
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:03.200]  restrictions and so on clamping down on civil liberties and by the way please don't describe
[1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:07.280]  my position as being anything close to communist china it's nothing like that i don't want people
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:11.440]  welded into their buildings and i'm not giving up my second amendment rights i'm just saying that
[1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:17.440]  if we don't isolate because our population is so sick and they're so malnourished and people are
[1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:21.920]  just not healthy and they're hooked on pharmaceuticals nationwide this is going to devastate america
[1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:27.280]  more like all the countries like i admire you you're a good friend of mine i'm trying to have a
[1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:30.880]  hardcore debate i'm not saying you're with the communist chinese and their political views
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:35.840]  their thing is lockdown stay in your house i'm saying on that extreme and in italy's following
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:41.520]  that everybody else is yes that extreme becomes the default of what trump's about to do i'm saying
[1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:47.360]  all china's response has become the default i've said trumps doing that it trumps italy is starting
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:52.960]  to see a reduction in the daily number of deaths now because of their lockdown so we we know that
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:57.600]  lockdowns actually do work after a lag time of about three weeks but are we gonna have lockdowns
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:02.560]  for the flu kills 35 000 a year well no because the mortality rate is so low you don't worry about
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:08.320]  that you don't shut down society for 0.1 percent a fatality rate you just accept that's the key
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:12.400]  you really think in your heart of hearts is that you're an engineer smart guy does the math
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:16.560]  owns a research lab you really do think it has a much higher killer rate than flu
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:22.880]  there's no question absolutely no question alex uh now in fact i think that the num the death rate
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:26.800]  is going to be higher in the united states and i think that the deaths that you know people talk
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:30.960]  about you even mentioned it that we think we know the number of deaths but we don't know the number
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:36.080]  of infected actually i think a lot of the people who died were not even counted as coronavirus
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:41.120]  deaths because they were just counted as pneumonia because the testing wasn't taking place so if you
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:45.680]  have that equation the numerator and the denominator we don't really have good numbers for the
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:50.480]  numerator it that may be much much higher because testing was not happening in the united states
[1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:55.600]  the key is going to be over the next few weeks yep you're going to take over with no destroyer

[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:16.000]  invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away all in the name of
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:21.520]  the liberalism and openness and that every day i have stacks of news articles just like today
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:28.240]  uk team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:36.000]  uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:43.440]  have caused anxiety in the new royalty that's the thought police if a leftist has their feeling
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:49.760]  sir for any reason you get fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are bullies
[1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:55.440]  and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:02.560]  out against it you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:20.400]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:29.360]  quite literally crashing through the lies and disinformation here we are oh and shroyer now
[1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:34.560]  hosting for alex mike adams it's with me we're gonna hear again from norm paddus before it's
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:41.040]  all said and done before i go back to mike i want to just go through my bullet points here of
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:46.640]  everything we're looking at and then make a few comments of my own as alex was saying if we're
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:53.120]  like looking at a grid or a scale of you know and mike adams is over here i'm probably like over
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:28:01.440]  here i mean and i'll explain that in a second but the irony of the u.s. government ignoring
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.960]  hundreds of thousands dead from prescription drugs millions dead from abortion hundreds of
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:11.120]  thousands dead from heart disease and all these other things all these cancer causing environments
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:18.720]  in the in the soil in the products we eat and rub on our skin people die from that no quarantine no
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:24.480]  shutdown no panic no no news even oh but the coronavirus is the one now let me go through
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:31.760]  these bullet points here to try to give you a clear picture it's 2020 and it's an election year
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:38.000]  the anti-globalist candidate president trump is due to sweep the upcoming elections the usa
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:45.600]  resurgence is happening the globalist the new world order can't have it you've had dozens of ceo's
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:49.520]  resign and by the way the reason i'm pointing all this out is because i think it's all connected
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:57.200]  folks you've had dozens of ceo's resign over the past two months dozens and the top companies
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:02.880]  including bill gates from the microsoft board uh you can't get testing kits anywhere but somehow
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:06.960]  celebrities and athletes are getting it and we're able to test them and know that and so we shut
[1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:13.600]  down all the leagues you have the emergency bills that they're trying to pass because of coronavirus
[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:22.400]  including abortion rights gun control and an internet takeover hmm how convenient you have
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:30.080]  you have jews in new york who refuse to be vaccinated claiming religious um exemptions
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:36.240]  them getting blamed for the spread of this so forced inoculations are being pushed as well
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:41.760]  yet the federal government just changed its monetary policy banks don't have to have 10 000 cash
[1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:47.200]  on hand you have the bill and melinda gates foundation all over this coronavirus outbreak
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:53.520]  now they're going to be handing out test kits is that so we can test efficacy you have drills
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:59.680]  happening in wuhan military drills event 201 where this exact thing is playing out just like the
[1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:04.240]  u.s government tested drills and had pamphlets everything handed out before 911 blaming osama
[1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:11.200]  bin laden you have google now being praised and asked to track all human activity in real time
[1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:16.240]  working with the government that's not scary at all that's what's happening in china you have
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:24.160]  everything closed down over i think it's been 50 deaths so far in the u.s again maybe it's bad
[1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:28.400]  maybe it gets worse where's the freak out over all the other things that are killing people
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:32.960]  you have all the elites going to their hideout bunkers in new zealand and other places what
[1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:38.000]  about all the stuff coming in from china i can still order a dozen things from china today
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:44.400]  why is that not being shut down and so here's what i'll say oh and by the way
[1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:51.120]  if trump would have arrested the deep state years ago if trump would have arrested all of these
[1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:56.720]  criminals in the federal government years ago none of this would be happening so that is the problem
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:03.440]  here now here's what i'll give it over to mike adams on because again you know folks we're not a
[1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:07.520]  cult here we're looking at all angles and i'm probably on the other side of the spectrum than
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:13.920]  mike um because i believe i already had coronavirus months ago i was in touch with people no one else
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:17.760]  i know has gotten it but i'll just say this and then let's get mike adams response to everything
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:24.000]  i just said whether this virus kills a hundred people a hundred thousand people or a hundred
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:29.520]  million people who will stand in the way of tyranny who will stand in the way of government tyranny
[1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:34.720]  and i cannot help but instinctually at a gut level feel that that's got to be infowars role now
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:40.000]  so that we don't lose everything because of hysteria and fear now mike i just laid out
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.880]  all the bullet points i didn't really give my low down opinion on this but uh what is your
[1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:49.520]  response to all that i believe it's all connected and i believe that if we would have rested deep
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:53.520]  state criminals years ago this would not be happening well you're absolutely right on that
[1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:57.680]  point and thank god hillary clinton is not president today as this is happening so the
[1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:03.200]  fact that trump is president is the saving grace to all of this now you made some really good points
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:08.400]  and i i honor and respect not just what you said but your courage by the way in the last few months
[1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:13.760]  and what you've done for our country in a leadership role to speak out against the tyranny
[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:19.280]  but a couple things that that i would add to your argument or or even challenge would be
[1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:23.920]  uh you know abortion and pharmaceutical deaths yeah they're very large and we fight against
[1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:29.200]  abortion every day but abortion is not a communicable disease and pharmaceutical deaths are not
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:33.600]  communicable just because one person gets an abortion doesn't spread an abortion death to
[1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:38.400]  another person so this is something different this is a communicable disease it spreads from
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:44.720]  person to person very rapidly very quickly and someone like you who's who's younger you survived
[1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:50.160]  it you believe you had it you survived it but you know how tough it was i remember you you talking
[1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:55.680]  about how you know how painful and how you felt so horrible sickest i'd been in 10 years since i
[1:32:55.680 --> 1:33:02.480]  had mono so imagine somebody who's even slightly immune compromise in their 50s or 60s or 70s
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:06.400]  by the way plenty of people are getting this in their 30s and 40s right now too so even though
[1:33:06.400 --> 1:33:11.680]  you survived it you might inadvertently spread it to somebody who cannot survive it and that's
[1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:16.160]  what we're dealing with here it's the structure of society when people get together even if they
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:20.960]  themselves become immune to it i'm sure i could survive it too i'm confident in that because of
[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:25.680]  nutrition but i wouldn't want to spread it to someone who who would not survive it and and
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:30.480]  those might not just be elderly then they might be a lot younger people now to your point about
[1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:38.080]  civil liberties look we are in trump is at the helm of a tyrannical system that probably needs to
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:43.280]  be slashed by 90 we need a much smaller government and you're right if we would have defeated the
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:48.960]  deep state years ago none of with none of this would have happened however why not encourage
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:55.120]  president trump to take this opportunity to do that now defeat the deep state now and then shrink
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:34:00.960]  the size of government yes we need less tyranny we need more liberty in fact there's an argument
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:06.400]  out there now that why do we even need a centralized federal government at all the cdc can't even
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:11.680]  create testing kits that's its entire job is to stop infectious disease and they can't seem to do
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:17.920]  that well as you know it's on purpose so why do we even have a cdc why do we have this this monster
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:24.240]  of a federal government that that now looms over us in this in this context i say we shrink the whole
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:29.280]  thing we cut it all by 90 we don't need washington telling us how to live our lives i agree with
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:36.160]  that point but if we don't self isolate right now millions will die and we can't stop that well
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:41.120]  this is why i'm a free market capitalist and i say free market first because this is key this is
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:45.360]  something that isn't debated enough the youth doesn't understand it in the free market you can be
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:49.760]  anything you can be a capitalist a communist socialist that's what we have we have a free market
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:56.320]  so in the free market i think that you're right to say hey look we can look at the science of this
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:00.160]  in the facts and say hey you know what you should probably stay inside if you think you have a cold
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:05.200]  if you think you're feeling sick stay inside don't travel uh you know don't do x that's what i did i
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:12.640]  stayed home for like uh you know 10 days quite frankly my stubbornness almost had me traveling to dc
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:17.680]  if i didn't feel so sick i probably would have been in dc on a plane uh maybe even spreading it myself
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:22.560]  just because i'm just the kind of guy that just gets out of bed and goes no matter what um but
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:30.000]  i think that when we're looking at how to deal with this mic self isolating self quarantining
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.040]  is good i i've got a plan ready to go if that goes down i've got two weeks of food if it's a two
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:40.880]  week deal i've got two months of food if it's a longer term deal i just i just feel like my biggest
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:48.640]  fear right now is not the coronavirus my biggest fear right now is government tyranny i think what
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:54.880]  you're really asking is can we can we come out of this with our liberties intact after the virus
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:36:00.080]  passes it will pass in a lockdown scenario that would last probably a maximum of eight weeks
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:04.480]  and i think what you're asking is will we ever have our freedoms after that and that's a legitimate
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:10.080]  question and i'm not i'm not sure what that answer is actually and the better option may be okay just
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:15.840]  let millions die and keep the government in check so that's an option so that's you know
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:20.880]  let's call that the info wars option because that the lawsuit that's about to be challenged
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:26.800]  filed by alex jones uh is kind of that option let's just let everything stay open and let people
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:31.440]  die and then move on but at least the government won't won't be a tyrannical regime at that point
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:35.520]  that's an option it's certainly a measure that we're looking at here but let's talk about this
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:40.720]  mike because i mean all the stuff and all the hysteria most people still don't care most people
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:45.520]  are still going out to bars they're still going out to wherever they're still flying i mean yes
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:51.840]  travel is down but they're still doing it so i mean you know at what point do we sit here and say
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:57.760]  okay we're just gonna see what happens or no you have to stop we always promote being prepared
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:02.880]  having firearms knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:06.960]  how to garden i mean it's just it's what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we do
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:11.760]  sell high quality swareable food i told my patriot a month ago i said what can you handle i said i
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:14.640]  think it's gonna be really big and they said well we can handle probably this we're not sure we're
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:18.000]  investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund and i said no i think
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.200]  this is going to be huge i think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:24.080]  even though the prices are going up for you so those are the top discussions we have i'm just
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:29.440]  giving the inside base of all of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:34.720]  times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay at info war store dot com you go right in the queue

[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:49.280]  continues like this we're looking at having to suspend food sauce but everybody gets their order

[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:06.400]  the alex jones show
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:40.160]  you know you can uh disagree on a lot of things and it's important to have these debates
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:44.560]  and iron sharpens iron but i'll tell you this
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:51.200]  there's no doubt in my mind and that's why i'm like in a weird place too here mike and we're
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:57.680]  going to talk about the potential of martial law and play this video but it's like we're we're i mean
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:03.280]  i'm almost having trouble facing it but it's like we're in almost the final battle for usa
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:08.000]  versus globalism it's like this is the moment we've known it's coming this is the bio weapon this is
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:13.200]  the attempted takedown of the america this is the attempted martial law worldwide this is it this is
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:18.160]  what we're dealing with we knew it was coming now how to deal with it what the facts are and all
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:23.520]  this stuff we can debate it but but but we're in it we're seeing it now and so it's like do you go
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:30.320]  into total war mode or do you kind of like it's like three days in the tomb where you just wait
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:37.360]  it out and then come out on the other side like yeah this is what we said so uh mike let me just
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:42.480]  get your take on that before we get into martial law and before we play this video of uh and that's
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:46.640]  the other thing too the media's cried wolf so many times that's the other thing mike the media can
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:51.040]  sit here and talk about coronavirus and try to panic people a lot of the people are they've seen
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:55.280]  the media been lying to them so long they just don't even listen to it uh and that's why bars are
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:59.760]  still crowded uh that's why people are still going to events and flying and all of this stuff but
[1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:07.040]  do you agree mike i mean this is to me this is it this is the moment and so that's why we can
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:11.520]  debate martial law because it's like does the president initiate martial law and then go after
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.080]  the deep state keep the streets clean when it's going on it's real so that's kind of where we're
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:19.920]  at so talk about that and then let's play this video of the meat just show an example of why
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:23.760]  nobody trusts the media but mike do you agree is this is this the pivotal moment is this the
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:30.640]  junction well this is and and the way we defeat the globalists is to keep trump alive and in
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:36.160]  office to keep america strong and independent so that that he can continue to do for at least
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:40.960]  four more years of fighting against the globalists and the way that trumps survives is we have to
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:47.040]  stop the virus from replicating and taking down america was with mass deaths and the way to stop
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.720]  the virus from replicating is to institute social distancing measures strong aggressive measures
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:57.600]  such as banning all domestic flights now that's not martial law and you know it was stewart roads
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:02.000]  that corrected me i was using the term kind of loosely martial law this martial law law over
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:05.760]  there stewart said no it's not martial law unless the military comes in and overthrows
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.960]  the local government so just banning flights or even blocking interstate traffic is not
[1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:16.000]  martial law it may look at it look like it or it may feel like it but we're not actually being ruled
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:21.040]  by the military we're still under the trump administration that's just instituting very
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:25.360]  aggressive social distancing measures so that trump can survive this is what i'm trying to get
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:30.800]  across to the the patriot community if millions die trump is finished i believe so the way to
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.440]  keep trump in office is to stop the massive numbers of deaths keep the number of deaths down to just
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:39.840]  tens of thousands and the only way to do that right now is strong social distancing so that's
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:43.680]  that's sort of the summary of where i'm at oh and and i appreciate you having me on to give
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:49.120]  give my take you know this is not a cult we don't have teleprompters we we we have different takes
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:53.680]  on this but that's why info wars is real news so that's my take well no quite frankly it's actually
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:45:00.160]  more exhilarating to have a structured debate with mike adams than to just sit here and see
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:04.240]  everything the same way but that's why i feel like we are at the junction mike because when we got
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:09.120]  to this point look i'm sure there were people telling george washin hey don't go across that frozen
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:13.680]  river i'm sure there were people telling me so it's like we're we're in the time right now we're
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:18.720]  going to have different opinions on how to deal with it but because we are the war generals here
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:23.600]  like that's why having this discussion is so important and and i think it's actually more
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:29.120]  important for us to disagree that way we can really measure out all these angles and think logically
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:35.200]  and clearly as we see these things play out now again though and we're going to go to this video
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:42.800]  so mainstream news has is now the boy that cried wolf it's even worse so that's right when when
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:47.760]  mainstream news comes out and creates all this hysteria whether it be over russian collusion
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:53.920]  or ukrainian prid quid pro quo or trump's racist or now covid 19 people aren't listening so is that
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:00.000]  a good thing is the bad thing here is a media report happening i believe it was outside an h e b
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:05.840]  was this in austin guys are in texas uh where they were shooting a live report and a gentleman stopped
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:16.080]  by to tell the cameras how he feels about mainstream news trucks are coming and going okay now there's
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.960]  somebody who is being number we'll talk to you guys a little bit later it's your fault that people
[1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:30.320]  are freaking out here you all there are the ones that are at fault this is this is no worse here at six o'clock in the morning
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:34.640]  i'm reacting to other people bro you don't have to react okay bye
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:42.080]  well no call your your fault your editors thank you all the scum of the earth
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:49.520]  i you know and i don't even blame the chinese i don't blame them at all they did everything right
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:55.360]  it's you all that are hyping things up goodbye have a good morning so see and then there's the other
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:47:01.760]  added element of this too mike where it's like you have to invest all your chips on in on one hand
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:06.720]  well no the media is causing panic in hysteria just like they try to do with everything that doesn't
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:11.840]  mean this isn't a potentially deadly thing yeah the difference is the media lies all day long so
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:15.840]  it's like how do you know when to trust them well you're exactly right actually the media lies all
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:20.720]  the time and but occasionally they will stumble upon something that's true that they think they
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:26.160]  can use to hurt trump the difference is that i'm a trump supporter i voted for trump i advocate for
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:32.800]  trump i want trump to succeed the left wants trump to fail that's the difference so the and also the
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:37.440]  media doesn't understand science the media doesn't understand math that you know we saw brine williams
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:42.800]  can't can't do basic math so yeah the media is totally discredited and whatever they're saying
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:47.840]  i mean who is even watching the media anymore that's the thing the people at fault here are people
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.080]  watching the media the mainstream media you're an idiot if you're watching the mainstream media
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:56.480]  people should be watching info wars to get real news and information so who's even watching the
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:02.320]  left wing media why does it matter what they say you know look the the truth is that this is a real
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:08.560]  virus trump's presidency will be threatened if millions die how do you stop millions from dying
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:14.880]  how do you do it well you know nutrients antivirals and social distancing those are the only options
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:20.320]  we have right now and every day that trump delays probably many thousands more maybe even tens of
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:26.080]  thousands more will die later this summer believe me oh and when june or july comes around you'll
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:32.800]  see it you will see the death count just just exploding by the day even now even if we do social
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:38.080]  distancing now we're still going to lose thousands maybe a lot more especially in new york city so
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.200]  it's not a small matter but trump can survive it if he navigates it very carefully and that's
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:48.000]  that's the debate here how does trump navigate this you know i don't have a crystal ball you
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.560]  don't either none of us are perfect but we're at least giving suggestions of how he might
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:57.440]  survive this so that he can fight the globalist that's the goal well and i'll just say this too
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:02.080]  and i'm going to read this from ron paul that we just posted at info wars dot com in the next
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:08.960]  segment the coronavirus hoax an authoritarian dream trump has made more measures to stop
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:14.000]  the coronavirus outbreak than any administration i've seen in the past and so you can go back
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:20.080]  and look at the numbers the h1n1 under biden and all this other stuff you've had 35 000 deaths a year
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:25.920]  from that 26 000 deaths another here so so whatever the final tally is i don't even think it'll matter
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:29.280]  whatever the president does they're still going to say he's bad they're still going to blame him
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:33.440]  whether there's 10 deaths 10 000 deaths 100 000 deaths they're still going to go after him
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:38.000]  my fear though is there's going to be some give and take here mike because if the president
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:43.040]  shuts everything down and the globalists get an economic collapse in america which is where
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:47.600]  this is headed right now that's a victory for them and i think that will hurt trump politically
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:53.680]  but you can't have an economy afterward if if your people are dead you you have to protect human
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:59.200]  life first to have an economy in the recovery you know how does the stock market ever go back to
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:04.800]  where it was before a month ago the answer is you you have to have people alive and working
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:09.760]  and this could kill millions if we if we don't take the right track here so you know you have to
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:14.320]  protect human life in order to have an economy that that's the whole point and by the way when
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:19.840]  the economy is going down now nobody's blaming trump they're blaming the virus and and that's a
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:25.040]  that's a biological weapon that was engineered it was tweaked by china it was released by obama
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:32.160]  obama era individuals in us universities that's all on obama this whole thing wouldn't have happened
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:37.440]  if the obamas and the bidens and the clintons weren't involved in in sharing secret weapons
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:42.560]  but don't you think the president has a much better backdrop for all of this if he comes out with that
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:47.600]  or do you think he's not saying that because it will cause panic i think he he doesn't want to be
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:52.480]  accused of of being a conspiracy theorist but that's actually a true conspiracy there are many
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:57.120]  conspiracies that are true that's one of them and he should come out and say it he should fire the
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:03.040]  the head of the cdc and he should he should follow the the advice of france's boil frankly shut down
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:07.120]  the death science industry and the scientists who who created this thing in the first place
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:12.720]  tell the the the truth to the world and then recommend vitamin c for god's sake and you know
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:17.760]  we could we could really suppress the number of infections from this day forward the solutions

[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:29.280]  of is upsetting me right now is that i mean i'm not calling president trump a liar but i mean
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:34.560]  let's call a spade a spade here they're not being fully honest about this folks they're not and i
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:40.320]  don't know what is measured about that i don't know who's in trump's ear but it would be a lot
[1:51:40.320 --> 1:51:44.640]  easier for president trump to to solve this if he said yeah this is probably a bio weapon we should
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:52.720]  hunker down this should really be easier than it is i'm not here giving you a sales pitch

[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:24.000]  dot com the corona virus hoax an authoritarian dream by ron paul governments love crises because
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.080]  when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:33.440]  will take care of them after 9 11 for example americans accepted a near total destruction of
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:40.480]  their civil liberties in the patriot acts hollow promises of security it is ironic to see the same
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.720]  democrats who tried to impeach president trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:50.240]  administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:55.120]  killed less than a hundred americans declaring a pandemic emergency on friday president trump
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:55:00.000]  now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:05.360]  as political rights stop and seize any plane train or automobile to stymie the spread of the
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:11.120]  contagious disease he can even call out the military to cordon off a us city or state
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:17.760]  state and local authorities love panic as well the mayor of champagne illinois signed an executive
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:23.520]  order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas water
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:31.200]  or electricity to any citizen the governor of ohio just essentially closed his entire state
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:36.080]  the chief fearmonger of the trump administration is without a doubt anthony fauci head of the
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:40.320]  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institute of health
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:45.120]  fauci is all over the media serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic he testified
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:49.600]  to congress that the death rate for the chronovirus is 10 times that of the seasonal flu a claim
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:54.800]  without any scientific basis on face the nation fauci did his best to further damage and already
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:59.520]  tanking economy by stating right now personally myself i wouldn't go to a restaurant he has pushed
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:04.640]  for closing the entire country down for two weeks over what a virus that has thus far killed over
[1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:09.280]  five thousand just over five thousand worldwide and less than a hundred in the united states by
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:16.720]  contrast tuberculosis and old disease not much discussed these days killed nearly 1.6 million
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:21.360]  in 2017 where's the panic over this by the way it's coming in over the southern border still
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:27.520]  wide open i just added that if anything what people like fauci and other fearmongers are
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:31.680]  demanding will likely make the disease worse the marshal law they dream about will leave
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:35.600]  people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:39.440]  where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity the panic produced by these
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:44.320]  fearmongers is likely helping the spread of the disease as massive crowds rush into walmart and
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:49.120]  casco for the last roll of toilet paper the madness over the chronovirus is not limited
[1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:54.720]  to politicians and the medical community the head of the neoconservative atlantic council
[1:56:54.720 --> 1:57:00.240]  wrote an editorial this week urging nato to pass an article five declaration of war against the
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:05.600]  coveted 19 virus are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:11.600]  people should ask themselves whether this chronovirus pandemic could be a big hoax
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:16.000]  with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:21.760]  financially or politically from the ensuing panic that is not to say the disease is harmless
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:26.560]  without question people will die from coronavirus those in vulnerable categories should take
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:32.160]  precautions to limit their risk of exposure but we have seen this before government overhypes
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:37.120]  a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms when the real when the threat and the quote
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:44.240]  unquote threat is over they never give us our freedoms back that is from ron paul at the ron
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:52.800]  paulinstitute.com again i think the 9 11 analogy is the best that i've seen mike adam 60 seconds
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:58.320]  would you like to respond to that ron paul's article is horribly misinformed and in eight
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:06.240]  weeks he will regret writing it his title calling this pandemic a hoax goes against every pillar
[1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:12.080]  of epidemiological and medical knowledge that he should have himself i love ron paul
[1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:18.080]  he's a hero for america but he is grossly misinformed in my opinion with this article
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:24.400]  and it stands as a tragic mistake to put out that information and called dr fouchy a fearmonger
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:28.240]  for simply telling people to get prepared so i strongly disagree with ron paul's
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:34.080]  article today and he will regret it he will regret writing it that's my right ladies and gentlemen
[1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:39.680]  this is the alex joneshow this is the only real discussion you're gonna have about the
[1:58:39.680 --> 1:58:44.960]  coronavirus with people who agree on some things disagree on other things looking at all the angles
[1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:51.600]  but hey i mean the reason why we're the experts on this is because we're the ones that told you
[1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:57.840]  this was coming whatever it is we told you it's really smart to get high quality storyable food

[2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:19.200]  his obedience to god it's alex jones ladies and gentlemen we're into the third hour of the alex
[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:26.080]  jones show today it's been very powerful it's going to be must listen to must see tv for probably the
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:34.240]  next month as we watch the corona virus spread or we watch the trump administration handle it
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:40.240]  correctly i will say this and i've kind of been saying this i in fact i give my credit folks
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:46.640]  because let me tell you being in this position and breaking this stuff down is not easy and it takes
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:52.640]  a lot of courage to put out what you're thinking what you're feeling what your research says
[2:00:53.200 --> 2:00:59.120]  because we're in like soft sand here and you don't want to step too quickly you might sink further
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:05.200]  and so while i may disagree or agree with mike believe me it takes a lot of courage for mike
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:09.440]  to come on here and say what he's saying in the face of a lot of people telling him not to say it
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:15.440]  let me tell you that and and and while i'm not on the the the far end of the spectrum as mike is
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:18.960]  thinking this is going to be as deadly or as outbreak as much i will say this and i'm i'm
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:24.160]  sure mike's hearing the same thing behind the scenes uh they're getting prepared for the worst
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:30.480]  i mean i mean i i'm not saying i think it's going to be the worst but there's no doubt
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:35.280]  it looks like probably within about two weeks we may see just basically total shutdown of
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:40.560]  civilization and they will call for bars to be shut down they probably will suspend flights they've
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:44.640]  been getting ready to do this actually for about two weeks now so i don't know what it is they're
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:49.520]  waiting on but they have had this in the works they're buying up food they're buying up iodine
[2:01:49.520 --> 2:01:53.760]  they're buying up silver so they're getting ready for the worst of the worst to happen
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:58.720]  and they're going to play it out in about two weeks so the slow roll of this is interesting
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:03.760]  mike what do you make of that what do you make of the slow roll of this coming out of the white
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:09.920]  house coming out of the cdc etc instead of the immediate clamp down which would have been appropriate
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:14.240]  if they really believe it's going to be that bad why not the immediate clamp down why this
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:18.960]  slow roll out is that to stop panic what do you think mike adams well again there's been a concerted
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:25.040]  effort this entire time to make sure the american people were not prepared so the mocking of preppers
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:30.240]  the surgeon general saying don't buy personal preparedness equipment a cdc officials saying
[2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:34.800]  don't buy food early on and then later changing to yes some people should stockpile well they
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:40.720]  didn't want to rush the market they were buying it up yeah but exactly you know if people had had
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:44.960]  been preppers all along over a long period of time there wouldn't be this rush in the grocery
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:49.280]  stores i mean understand the people who are mobbing the grocery stores today are the people who
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:54.320]  failed to prepare in advance there are no preppers in those long lines the preppers are at home
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:58.720]  with the goods they already purchased months before so preppers prevent panic this is a very
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:04.800]  crucial point to get out there preppers prevent panic it's the the late comers the people who are
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:09.680]  surprised by this that suddenly panic because they've been getting bad information from the government
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:15.360]  on purpose this entire time so many many sectors of our government have done a disservice to the
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:20.320]  american people by not allowing them to get prepared now but here's the other thing oh and
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:25.520]  if trump locks this down and and alex mentioned this earlier and he's correct about this if trump
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:31.040]  locks things down he will suppress the number of deaths down to just maybe tens of thousands of
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:38.320]  people and then we will all be attacked for saying i was no big deal well the reason it was no big
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:42.960]  deals is because he locked it down so if you don't lock it down you get millions of deaths if you do
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:47.840]  lock it down you get maybe tens of thousands so that's the choice we have either way we're all
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:51.520]  going to get blamed anyway you know that oh and we're all going to get smeared we're all going to
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:56.480]  get blamed even trump will get blamed no matter what he does so the real question is do we still
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:03.200]  have our principles intact and and yes i am 100 pro constitution pro liberty pro trump pro america
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:07.840]  not giving that up not taking a forced shot not giving up my firearms and i'm still fighting for
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.240]  the first amendment by the way and if we had more protections of the first amendment if trump had
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:17.200]  gone after big tech before then we would have had a bigger platform to help people get prepared
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:21.600]  in advance of all of this so that's another argument why we need free speech on social
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:26.880]  media by the way we could have helped people this entire time yeah that's a good point because
[2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:31.920]  like i said we were the only ones talking about this years ago uh i can't say before anybody
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:37.760]  ever heard of covet 19 because they're writing about it in books decades ago somehow uh that magical
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:44.240]  mystery that's going on but you know mike as i'm just continuing to look at the stuff that's coming
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:47.680]  down here what would you say because here's the other thing people want to put everybody into
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:53.440]  a box i guarantee you mike adam's answer to this next question goes far outside of the box that
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:57.360]  he's already in mike would you've already answered this but let me just get it on record here
[2:04:57.360 --> 2:05:03.440]  would you take a vaccine for the covet 19 and would you suggest others take it look i can't
[2:05:03.440 --> 2:05:07.920]  speak to each person's individual choice i would never take it because it's going to be rushed and
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:12.720]  it will be experimental and it may end up killing you with the next infection you get that's what
[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:17.680]  happened with the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine experiments that they tried to run on animals the animals were
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:24.560]  fine initially but with a subsequent infection many of them died the the fatality rate skyrocketed
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:29.520]  and that's why they don't have a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine right now so i would never take this vaccine
[2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:35.680]  not even at gunpoint if look if if they want to send government officials to my home to force me
[2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:39.920]  to take a vaccine they better bring some body bags because that's that's exactly how it's
[2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:44.640]  going to go down not i'm not taking the vaccine now of course then they can force me not to take
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:49.600]  air flights well guess what i'm not taking flights anyway so but but yeah they're going to try to
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:54.080]  lock down society and have a show me your papers about the vaccines and i'm going to fight against
[2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:59.040]  that oh and i'm going to fight against that vigorously aggressively for years to come because
[2:05:59.040 --> 2:06:03.440]  i know that's what they're going to try to do with this outbreak mike as far as i have seen
[2:06:04.400 --> 2:06:11.840]  we have not stopped shipments in mass coming in from china and the only basic research i did
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:16.320]  from this i mean you can look up some stories in the news i tend to like to i'm i'm from the show
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:20.720]  me state i like to live things out for myself obviously you can't do that with every measure but
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:28.560]  sometimes you can i can order right now shoes from china clothes from china products from china on
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:32.880]  amazon i can order it all right now have it shipped and delivered to my house within two weeks
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:38.320]  why are we still taking packages from china if that's where the outbreak has been so deadly
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:43.440]  and and so out of control well why is there no measure to stop that well that that's from the
[2:06:43.440 --> 2:06:49.440]  obama era where there was a subsidy of the us postal service to allow china to ship products
[2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:56.880]  cheaply into the united states to really suppress local domestic us businesses that's obama era stuff
[2:06:56.880 --> 2:07:02.240]  and amazon has been subsidized by obama era rules and regulations as well trump's been
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:07.360]  trying to reverse a lot of that to help protect us businesses but by the way the big message
[2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:12.400]  trump should take out of this in my opinion is to say hey let's reestablish industry in america
[2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:17.200]  let's make things in america let's buy things in america even the pharmaceutical industry
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:22.400]  which i'm no fan of but if you're gonna have big pharma why not make pharmaceuticals domestically
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:26.080]  so you have a redundant supply by the way back i i want to get a more focused answer from you here
[2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:31.760]  but by the way we've become oil independent under trump we're relying on chinese steel under trump
[2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:37.600]  and he just signed an executive order to stop relying on on chinese pharmaceutical goods um all
[2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  good moves but again though i mean do you think there should be a stopping of all shipments coming
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:47.200]  from china do you think that is something that needs to be declared are they afraid that will stop
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:52.320]  supply lines well it has to be a gradual change for example in rare earth minerals
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:57.440]  we have made great strides in the last two years to get away from china the chinese monopoly that
[2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:02.720]  existed in in 2016 and 2017 that's changed dramatically so but it has to be gradual oh and
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:07.920]  otherwise you're gonna shut down telecom aircraft automobile manufacturing consumer electronics you
[2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:12.720]  shut down every industry right now if you cut off china supply lines but over time we could get away
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:17.280]  with that but it's going to take years no question about it well i guess let me ask this then
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:24.640]  could the coronavirus potentially still be spreading from china to the u.s because of this
[2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:31.120]  shipping well it's very unlikely that that would be a significant factor even if the
[2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:35.680]  coronavirus lives for days on certain surfaces such as cardboard up to nine days according to
[2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:41.760]  some estimates but frankly i think the domestic air travel in america is spreading far more
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:47.280]  numbers of these cases right now domestic air travel and the border both need to be shut down
[2:08:47.280 --> 2:08:51.920]  right now in my opinion and i look i appreciate you having me on i know we're about out of time but
[2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:56.240]  i'm going to give you my straight up opinion oh and you're never gonna i'm never gonna fudge it
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:09:00.960]  i'm never gonna try to be the popular guy i'm just gonna give you what i think and and what my
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:05.360]  numbers are showing and you know audience can take it or leave it but at least you know you're
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:10.400]  getting what i really believe no one's pulling my strings and telling me what to say when i'm
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:14.480]  i'm glad that we're getting different different views on this it's kind of weird you know people
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:17.760]  in the audience like hey you know some people saying this some people well yeah i mean this
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:22.000]  is a real discussion nobody tells us what to think nobody tells us what to do in fact i'll
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.200]  be perfectly honest last week mike adams told me not to fly i flew over the weekend mike i did
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:31.680]  i hopped on a plane and i flew and i went out in the mountains and i uh i shot some guns and i
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:35.600]  hiked some mountains and you know i don't regret it because quite frankly i thought they'll probably
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:39.440]  gonna shut it down in two weeks i wouldn't be able to take a vacation but you said you thought you
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:46.560]  had the coronavirus before so it was over a month ago can i still have some you i've been in contact

[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:08.480]  building a post-human world but we know they're going to strike back and the UN has said that
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:14.320]  they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:20.320]  as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse our social services
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:26.320]  and a giant cloud and pivot program the UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us
[2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:33.760]  capitulate to world government inner coronavirus this is a critical year and it's a critical time
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:39.680]  to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:45.360]  but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about band.video
[2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:52.320]  and infowars.com forward slash show that is so important you are at the center of the resistance
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:58.560]  you are our only hope real stuff man we're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:02.480]  day long but man I tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough
[2:13:02.480 --> 2:13:07.200]  shot over them everybody I'm I mean I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:12.640]  over that said about two months ago I came with a plan that I haven't launched yet we have a warehouse
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:18.080]  full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the democrats
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:22.960]  save the second amendment defend the first amendment infowars.com and it looks like duct tape
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:26.400]  it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth you'd go to a Trump rally and you
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:30.080]  instantly take over without even disrupting things people say why are you doing this
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:34.160]  what's happening when you go well we're being censored you know Trump won't do anything about
[2:13:34.160 --> 2:13:37.600]  it and Dr. Pachettic I'm let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:43.840]  it's brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence
[2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:49.600]  and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:14:14.400]  disturbing to people silence you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:19.920]  there really are so many angles to this ladies and gentlemen from austin texas broadcasting
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:27.200]  worldwide it's alex jones oh and shroyer info alex jones really so many angles i'm just sitting
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:34.000]  here discussing it with the crew again i mean people i'm not disrespecting mike adams i think
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:39.600]  he's courageous with his research and his opinion i just i just don't agree with all of it i don't i
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:44.720]  don't think it's going to get that deadly he says well these are the facts well how do we know these
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:48.480]  are the numbers again though i'm not going to go back down that road you already heard from mike
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:59.120]  i want to go and hear from you give out the phone number right now 877-789-2539 877-789-2539
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:06.800]  i just feel like there's so many different ways you can play this but now see this is the factor
[2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:14.160]  here if this is a bio weapon and it's been designed to get into you and affect you and then really
[2:15:14.160 --> 2:15:20.400]  outbreak two months three months later well then we need to be told that no one's no one from the
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:25.440]  trump administration is talking about this being a bio weapon nobody from the trump administration
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:30.560]  is trying to figure out where this thing really came from and quite frankly i'm sick of all the
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:36.560]  commentary just sitting here blaming china that is the that is it's just pathetic that's
[2:15:36.560 --> 2:15:44.560]  like blaming osama bin laden for 9 11 okay i'm just going to leave it at that but the phone
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:53.680]  number for you to weigh in 877-789-2539 let's get your take on all this the response everything
[2:15:53.680 --> 2:16:01.360]  we've talked about now again we've been selling preparedness items for decades at info or store
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:08.000]  dot com and so it's funny to see all these people telling you to panic about coronavirus then also
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.400]  trying to attack our store uh no we were selling these products long before you ever heard of
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  coronavirus because we knew the threat of government tyranny we knew the threat of biological warfare
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:25.600]  and we knew how important it would be to be prepared and be ready to be independent with
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:34.400]  emergency food or water filters or whatever for a couple months or longer and so yeah you're seeing
[2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:39.600]  panic at stores you're seeing people go out and buy 500 rolls of toilet paper buying out stores
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:45.360]  of hand sanitizer which at the end of the day ain't gonna save you but this is the panic that's
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:57.360]  ensuing but let me tell you this guys dot cam i i gotta say of all the things that we've done here
[2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:08.400]  at info wars and with the coronavirus outbreak happening and and just being so delicate on how
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:19.920]  to cover this i cannot be more proud of what alex jones has decided to do with these lawsuits and
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:29.280]  instinctually at my gut level instinctually at my gut level i couldn't even help it folks
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:37.040]  call it god's will but instinctually at my gut level i feel like info wars role in this
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:41.120]  again this is not even commenting on how deadly the virus may or may not be
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:48.320]  i feel that our role in this time is to be the last line of defense against tyranny because
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:55.440]  no one else will do it and so yeah we have lawsuits that are going to go into effect
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:04.320]  should the trump administration basically end the bill of rights and the constitution and commerce
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:10.160]  end free travel end the free market we've got the lawsuits now this isn't cheap folks believe me
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:17.440]  and the reason why we don't litigate like this is because it's expensive and we're dealing with
[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:24.400]  so much on the back end it's time consuming it's expensive so we're going to be there like in like
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:30.960]  the tank man at tianamin square that info wars in fact we got that shirt pull that shirt up that's
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:38.800]  how you can fund us we are the tank man at tianamin square and you know what maybe the virus is that
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:47.680]  deadly just like the communist chinese will mow down 100 million people but we're gonna be standing
[2:18:47.680 --> 2:19:00.080]  there against tyranny and just again i there's the shirt info wars tank man we are the tank man
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:09.760]  ladies and gentlemen so go to info wars store dot com and fuel this fight because we will be the
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:18.400]  last stand against tyranny believe me and you heard mike adams hey we may disagree on how to
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:22.880]  handle this coronavirus or the effects or anything but you heard him he's not taking a vaccine i ain't
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:36.160]  taking a vaccine uh uh so i want to get your take on everything uh guys i don't have a uh
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:44.960]  you can just pull the caller list up on my monitor over here 877-789 alex if you want to
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:52.720]  get into the show today what do you think about the coronavirus i just feel like it's already
[2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:59.840]  come here it's been here for months everybody that was getting sick in december and january are now
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:03.280]  like oh that's why i was so sick that's why i was sicker than i'd ever been
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:07.920]  and so here we are
[2:20:11.040 --> 2:20:14.880]  and by the way well i won't even get into it because maybe someone else will bring it up but
[2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:18.880]  let's take one call before we take this break and then i'll continue to go to your calls
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:24.080]  and let's go with rey in michigan go ahead rey
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:35.120]  hey oh and uh great show long time listener so i went to uh the uh secretary state today
[2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:43.120]  to renew my cab on my truck and uh they've got the place all closed down and said that they wanted
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:51.920]  you to make an appointment to go in there to see them they're all nobody's in there nobody
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:20:56.160]  oh but you know if you got pulled over you'd probably get ticketed for not having your updated
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:21:03.440]  you know registration and then uh some sitting there saying to her well well why don't you
[2:21:03.440 --> 2:21:10.400]  just let me go in there get my cab i mean give me some kind of of a clean sanitizer or something
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:16.400]  and no we can't do that in such as what's the difference between me making an appointment
[2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:23.440]  or just coming in there right now and then she says well these these are the rules and i
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:32.640]  did sit back there and i think to myself man this is such control how much control can people have
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:38.800]  like just total hysteria when i think a lot of people are realizing that now rey because of this
[2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:43.040]  i think a lot of people are really getting more in tune to that probably tuning into info wars
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:48.560]  because we've been talking about it forever and they're pissed guess what red blooded americans
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:54.800]  don't like being told what to do and i got to be honest like i said i'm more afraid of government
[2:21:54.800 --> 2:22:02.720]  tyranny forever till the day i die than of than of the covid 19 or any other virus 110 percent

[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:37.280]  conversation and debate happening in the in the breaks here some of which maybe i'll say on air
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:44.720]  but not today but yeah there is a lot of silver linings happening with this coronavirus hysteria
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:56.400]  or spread but let me here's here's where we're at right now there is no doubt to me and we've been
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:28:01.440]  kind of teasing this just to see how it would go because of what we're being told on scenes but
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:06.320]  folks they're gonna shut everything down this is the globalist attempt this is the deep state attempt
[2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:10.640]  to wreck the economy they're going for broke that's what we're dealing with they're going for broke
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:17.840]  and my guess is they end up shutting everything down probably within a month they'll just shut
[2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:23.840]  it all down of course they'll blame trump and then you'll have other people blaming china
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:34.000]  like as if that's yeah it's just it's all really low IQ stuff but i think what we're
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:40.160]  going to end up facing is i don't think americans are going to run in fear i don't think they're
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:45.600]  going to hunker down and do it they're already not doing it and i just don't see that changing so
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:52.000]  i'm going to stop myself now or i'll just run on forever let's go back to the phone calls
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:29:02.880]  let's go to lin in colorado go ahead lin hello how how are you um i'm i'm a little nervous i want
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:10.800]  to get this out please bear with me this is so important i think everyone is missing it in 2014
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:18.320]  the medicare and medicaid system was turned over to the department of defense ibm for centennial
[2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:24.640]  care conduit care the state of alaska had thrown them out and the state of new mexico had adopted
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:31.680]  them in this is for all ten regions of the united state please make no mistake about this
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:38.800]  this when it was turned over it i started looking into it nothing is by accident the department
[2:29:38.800 --> 2:29:47.360]  of defense came up a super ai computer called watson this super ai computer the purpose of it
[2:29:47.360 --> 2:29:54.480]  and i couldn't believe my eyes was that by 2021 the american population would have a medical
[2:29:54.480 --> 2:30:03.280]  rfid patch in their right hand and and um all their information would be on it they're banking
[2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:13.120]  everything this started in 2014 i challenged all of you and christians believers please look this up
[2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:22.160]  i have become a targeted individual i am 62 years old but i won't be afraid
[2:30:22.160 --> 2:30:33.200]  and i will stand and i will tell the truth may god be with us all thank you lin and everything
[2:30:33.200 --> 2:30:38.800]  that lin has just said has been even documented at info wars dot com we've been covering it
[2:30:39.600 --> 2:30:43.760]  we've been warning about the force inoculations we've been warning about the chip the mark of the
[2:30:43.760 --> 2:30:48.560]  beast we told you they'd use a biological outbreak to do it that's what's going on
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:55.040]  and i'm not going to get into some geopolitical thing where i point the finger at china this
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:31:02.080]  is well and far beyond china ladies and gentlemen this is the international criminal cabal trying
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:08.480]  to take down the united states which quite frankly the ones that we're dealing with don't like china
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:14.080]  now they may want to use china's model of control and they work with china to develop ai and test
[2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:19.440]  it and everything but believe me they don't like china they don't have control over china
[2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:25.600]  so i just don't like the whole finger pointing and blaming china thing i think it's very low
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:33.200]  iq geopolitical stuff to engage in like blaming osama bin laden for 9 11 maybe you believe that
[2:31:33.200 --> 2:31:39.280]  let's go back out to the phones and go to taylor in texas go ahead taylor
[2:31:39.280 --> 2:31:42.480]  hey oh and uh man
[2:31:47.040 --> 2:31:50.320]  guys are we having trouble with our phone lines today because like everyone keeps breaking

[2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:08.720]  bill rina i don't believe so okay in 2010 he did an interview with a whistleblower
[2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:18.320]  back back in 2005 i believe he posted in 2010 on youtube on alpha zero and in detail described
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:25.280]  exactly what they were going to do with china with the virus flu like symptoms everything um
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:35.120]  also um the heb stores in texas austin dalis and um san antonne are closing
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:42.880]  uh for warehouse space for their stores and they're hiring um police officers to guard them
[2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:49.360]  and also uh allied signal uh guards wait a second wait a second i'm a little unclear
[2:32:49.360 --> 2:32:55.520]  you're saying that the h e b grocery stores are planning on closing yeah they're closing some of
[2:32:55.520 --> 2:33:01.920]  their stores and okay i haven't seen that yet and the last i saw was that trump was working
[2:33:01.920 --> 2:33:06.640]  with some of the the heads of these major grocery stores and it's like as if they were prepared for
[2:33:06.640 --> 2:33:11.120]  this a while ago because they're coming out saying hey look we're good even the h e b ceo said don't
[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:19.360]  worry we still got your back yeah well they're hiring uh guards and they're hiring police officers
[2:33:19.360 --> 2:33:25.040]  to guard them and the uh okay so they're just expecting panic to ensue and then them to just
[2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:32.160]  be overwhelmed i guess either that or is there going to be um i heard something about um arresting
[2:33:32.160 --> 2:33:37.200]  a bunch of cartel members maybe uh throw them in there something i don't know but you know what
[2:33:37.200 --> 2:33:41.360]  i'm glad you said that chris because look is what it comes down to the president should have
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:47.120]  started arresting people years ago okay we wouldn't be dealing with this now if we don't start having
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:53.520]  criminals in this international criminal cabal going down if we if we don't have people getting
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:34:00.800]  locked up and thrown in jail for all the crimes against humanity uh this year the coronavirus
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:06.480]  will win and i don't mean the actual virus i mean tyranny chris thanks for the call all right let's

[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:24.240]  to you but anyways moving on from that um i just wanted to touch bases on um i go to a small church
[2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:31.760]  and they were uh people online were criticizing uh half our members uh just were going to church
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:35.920]  and so i feel like the same tyranny you know how they did you know they kind of fully enrallied
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:41.120]  against you they kind of were you know they will use that same angle to attack you going to
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:48.000]  gatherings or any any types of even church gatherings but um but that being said you know um
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:54.320]  i just i i agree with you i'm not afraid of the virus call me selfish uh but i do have a family
[2:34:54.320 --> 2:35:00.800]  and you know i'm just worried about the safety of other people uh reacting in a in a panic manner
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:06.480]  uh just like that last caller said um you know just you know get having guards at grocery stores
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:10.800]  i mean that's that's like a prison state you know that's that's that's crazy well this has all been in
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:14.400]  the works for a while i don't know why they're slow rolling it as far as the trump administration is
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:18.880]  concerned and let me just be clear too i'm not disrespecting mike adams and his analysis here
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:24.080]  i may disagree with some i may agree with some we need all kinds of people on this team if you
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:27.360]  want to have a winning championship team i mean you can't even watch a sporting event so they're
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:31.360]  rolling all these replays like there's this one about why the bulls got dennis ron is like well
[2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:35.840]  they needed that piece hey we need people like mike adams but guess what we need people like me too
[2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:39.040]  you're gonna stand up and jerry nadler's face telling me committed treason we need people
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:42.800]  like me too who's gonna stand up in the senate and say no go ahead and rest me for my free speech
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:48.480]  i'm not bowing down to tyranny man call me selfish i am just convicted to take this rule i've never
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:53.760]  been more strong in standing up to tyranny than i feel like right now and it's a tough place to be
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:36:02.960]  considering how sensitive this is thanks for the call taylor but look i'm telling you folks we've
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:09.120]  been telling you this they have been ready for about two weeks to just get everything shut down
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:16.160]  they've been making the moves for a while okay behind the scenes buying up food buying up supplements
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:22.640]  getting the cdc ready for the worst getting local police ready for the worst i mean this
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:29.360]  information eventually trickles back to us i haven't wanted to add to the hysteria i'm just telling
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:35.040]  you what's going on folks and again mike adams could be a hundred percent correct but something
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:40.720]  doesn't add up why all the panic for this and not the swine flu that killed like 10 times as many
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:46.240]  people in in the same amount of time in that given year what is different about this coronavirus
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:50.320]  that they're not telling us because they're not telling it you're already it's all hearsay it's

[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:18.640]  sustainable anywhere from uh eight ten hours i don't feel the jitters like i do drink and

[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:35.440]  did want his name on it and i said what would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible
[2:38:35.440 --> 2:38:39.760]  that's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and

[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:52.400]  of that living defense it's true folks we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:41:00.320]  living defense is over the top good you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:17.040]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:23.920]  and now your host owin shroyer
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:33.200]  it's exhilarating very controversial this subject of the coronavirus
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:44.400]  anybody involved in a bio weapons lab needs to be arrested immediately
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:46.400]  and questioned
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:52.320]  just like francis boyle said
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:02.400]  because we don't know where this coronavirus came from folks i'm not playing geopolitical chess
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:07.520]  here and pointing the finger at china yeah that's where the big outbreak happened that made it a
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:13.680]  nationwide worldwide story but is that where it came from hey i don't trust the chinese
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:16.400]  government as much as the next guy claiming it came from the u.s but
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:24.000]  do you trust the u.s government that told you 19 intelligence agencies trump colluded with russia
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:29.680]  so let's check ourselves here for a second before we play nationalist geo politics and
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:35.120]  just point the finger at china no this is much deeper than that this is the final deep state
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:41.760]  attack to try to bring down trump now a lot of people believe i'm not telling you this but i'll
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:50.880]  report you what people believe they think trump is behind this to basically go into lockdown
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:56.320]  martial law while the deep state criminals the treasonous criminals are rounded up and arrested
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:43:03.040]  i'm not saying i believe that there's just a lot of commentary on that um so you guys will throw that
[2:43:03.040 --> 2:43:09.280]  angle out there but it just doesn't add up something else is going on here behind the scenes
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:15.280]  and i mean if you can't tell that i just don't even know how it's just instinctual it's just a
[2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:22.400]  given it's just it's when the math doesn't add up when two plus two equals five guess what that means
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:29.680]  that one is somewhere around okay so two plus two doesn't equal five but two plus two plus one
[2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:36.880]  does equal five what is that one what is it we're missing let's go back out to the phone lines let's
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:46.400]  go to andy in montana go ahead andy oh and hey i'd like to draw several points together so bear
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:54.160]  with me here let's say hypothetically that one wanted to create a super vaccine that could train
[2:43:54.160 --> 2:44:01.280]  the body to defend against multiple types of viruses one way to do this would be to create
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:07.280]  a super bug that has different parts from different places that don't occur in nature now if you
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:13.680]  remember the 2000 film mission impossible too this was the very plot of that movie i don't know if
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:19.840]  your crew can find it but the lead scientist he has a line that says something like to find we needed
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:29.760]  to find the hero it was his job to create a super vaccine so he says to do this we created a monster
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:38.080]  they named that monster chimera which as we know Greek mythology also applies to modern day medicine
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:42.080]  combining two different things that should not be together what do you think
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:47.360]  uh i'm not about what
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:57.280]  well so hear me out antibodies attack viruses by basically gumming up the works so let's say
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:06.000]  you want to inoculate against hiv infars and the common cold at the same time that would be the
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:13.840]  super bug well look this covid 19 was obviously made in a lab okay now nobody wants to report on
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:16.560]  this because they don't want to be called a conspiracy theorist or they're afraid they're
[2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:22.080]  going to get banned off the internet well we're going to report on it okay and so i don't know
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:27.200]  about mission impossible too but i know about the real world and i know that people are making
[2:45:27.200 --> 2:45:33.120]  bio weapons in labs now did it leak was it intentionally released we'll never know nobody
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:38.640]  wants to talk about it we don't get anything from the trump administration so look i'm not i'm not
[2:45:38.640 --> 2:45:43.120]  even i'm not even bashing trump i'm just telling it like it is thanks for the call andy let's go
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:52.000]  now to hobs in nebraska go ahead hobs hey how's it going well i'm not sick from coronavirus
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:58.160]  right now so i got that going for me oh well i'd say that uh your last month's illness probably
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:06.400]  inoculated you against it well any well i don't uh i don't want to get a reputation to be in the
[2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:12.880]  guy that calls in off topic but uh i think that while all of this uh covid 19 thing has been
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:17.360]  going on there's been a lot going on in the world that doesn't have to do with that that's just been
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:24.320]  kind of glossed over uh for instance there's a push to put an end to end to end encryption
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:29.840]  through messenger apps there's a yeah they tried to sneak that in the bill that's the i i'm so
[2:46:29.840 --> 2:46:34.400]  glad i'm sorry to cut you off but but you're right i i didn't mention it again i mentioned it earlier
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  but i mentioned again why are they sneaking in abortion rights into this bill why are they
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:45.760]  sneaking in gun control into this bill why are they sneaking in an internet takeover into this
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:52.320]  bill which hobs just brought up why is that in the bill at all that's trying to see what they
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:58.480]  can get away with bigger the one that i really wanted to call in with uh involves a situation
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:05.200]  in maryland that happened last thursday a young man who was active on uh militia and second
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:12.400]  amendment groups was supposedly killed in his sleep at 430 on a uh no knock red flag
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:15.840]  right yeah i saw that i meant to bring that up but i didn't have time
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:25.440]  yeah he uh there's there's conflicting reports uh the police say that he confronted them and his
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:29.920]  family and their lawyer is saying that he was asleep next to his girlfriend and they just
[2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:35.920]  opened fire so i wanted to call in with uh david night on this one because he's more the civil
[2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:42.880]  libertarian but i didn't get through this morning but uh yeah it's like given with what this man was
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:50.560]  involved in with uh he was a software engineer he was developing a encrypted uh website like
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:59.040]  messaging board uh so you know it's like is is that dunking left guys or what yeah dunking
[2:47:59.040 --> 2:48:08.800]  lump was the guy's name wasn't it correct yeah no one's talking about that no one
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:15.040]  and i don't i don't think that there's necessarily a connection there as as far as like they're
[2:48:15.040 --> 2:48:20.000]  trying to distract from that story or something similar i just think it's just natural that's
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:26.320]  already going on we're just you know everybody's focused on this coronavirus thing because look i
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:31.840]  mean how do you explain this guys we're all connected okay god created this entire thing
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.000]  he created all of us he created the world he created everything okay we're all connected here
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:43.520]  so yes the media hysteria is causing all the focus but but there's a subconscious thing happening
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:49.200]  here there's something beneath the surface happening here that we all know in our subconscious
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:52.560]  but consciously can't comprehend it we don't have enough information but we know it's there
[2:48:52.560 --> 2:49:00.160]  that's why we're all focused on this thanks for the call hops let's go to baldy in new york go
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:08.320]  ahead baldy so real quick um before i leave the house every day i put a protective layer of uh
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:14.160]  super silver wound gel on my hands i coat the back of my throat with super blue silver immune
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:20.960]  gargle and then i smear inside my nostrils a combination of x3 and x2 and then i leave the
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:28.560]  house with no fear which may be the most important of the four um now people i respect have been
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:38.160]  calling this the uh chinese coronavirus or the foreign virus um and and i have to i'm calling
[2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:45.760]  because i i have to disagree with that i'm just like 19 Saudis uh with box cutters we're not
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:54.560]  would not have been able to shut down norad for two hours china could not have our our cdc sandbag
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:50:01.760]  president trump like to have been for the last couple weeks um it was under president obama's
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:08.160]  administration that north carolina gave this virus to china so i'm here by branding this the
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:17.280]  obama virus now last we spoke uh road warrior owen was on the january third edition of the
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:23.280]  war room actually four days before anyone even heard of the coronavirus and i made several
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:29.680]  predictions uh and many have come true and the rest are unfolding before our eyes first in least
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:36.560]  cons uh least consequential was that alex jones would be the next to join the baldy's um my next
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:45.280]  strategic guest was that a national pandemic was imminent uh false flag pandemic uh and that is
[2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:53.920]  because brocco st obama has declared war on the united states and its citizens um and then again
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:51:00.400]  that is why this is the obama virus and my final prediction was that new york would be one of the
[2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:07.680]  first demanding vaccines which of course are going to do more harm than the virus itself and that
[2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:15.600]  that is why the un troops the gun confiscation troops are being hired yeah i i think l.a and new
[2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:21.840]  york will be the first to go into lockdown seattle will probably follow and then it's just
[2:51:21.840 --> 2:51:28.240]  going to set a precedent it's like oh wow if you don't do this millions of deaths are on your hands
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:38.720]  so i look folks it's very complicated gateway pundit dot com coronavirus fatality rate reported
[2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:47.200]  by the media is completely inaccurate less than the flu info wars life dot com info wars life
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:53.360]  dot com info wars life dot com you go to that url it takes you to the subsection of info wars

[2:54:02.160 --> 2:54:07.200]  i'm about to hand it over to jailed salenti in the next segment i will take a couple more phone
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:12.640]  calls again though the story from joe hoff at the gateway pundit coronavirus fatality rate
[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:20.000]  reported by media completely inaccurate actual rate less than the flu so the debate rages on
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:27.840]  here's a debate i won't have i'm a free man i don't want to spread any disease if i feel
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:33.360]  alive the disease i'll quarantine didn't leave my house for 10 days when i was sick but i'm healthy
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:40.720]  and as far as i know i haven't been told this is a bio weapon so it's just another flu bug so i
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:54:45.760]  shouldn't be worried about it let's go back out to the phone lines josh in florida go ahead josh
[2:54:47.040 --> 2:54:53.360]  hey how are you doing elwin um a lot of that stuff um coming out of the q movement about
[2:54:53.360 --> 2:54:59.840]  how this is all going to be used to target the deep state and and it's just more nonsense that comes
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:07.440]  out of the q movement it reminds me of uh the churches that just say hey don't stand up against
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:12.320]  evil don't worry about anything you're all going to get raptured away so don't worry about it it's
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:18.960]  very dangerous and it needs to stop uh my take on the whole thing is that i feel like uh president
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:24.960]  trump has been checkmated by the new world order no matter what he does or doesn't do
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:31.600]  i think all he can do now is just maneuver and uh i like to get your thoughts on that
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:37.920]  well i think this i i think in a way you're right as far as trump being put into check but not check
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:44.240]  mate trump still has moves up his sleeve if he wants to make them now he can just topple his king
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:52.000]  and say game over but trump still has all the cards man now again maybe it's connected maybe it's not
[2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:58.640]  think about all the crimes that have been happening against him with the illegal spine
[2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:04.160]  with the abuse of the phisa system with the whole russian collusion hoax i mean the list
[2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:10.080]  just goes on and on the fake hate crimes uh the media intentionally trying to collapse the stock
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:15.120]  market i mean this is all going on so let's say because i don't necessarily disagree i think they
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:20.880]  kind of at this time do have trump in check and he's maybe weighing his options but he's not in
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:25.520]  checkmate i think the best thing for president trump to do right now is to move against the deep
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:31.920]  state that's what that's what his focus should be he knows who the treasonous people are he's
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:37.440]  he's he's put it out there he's talked about it he's called it out move on him arrest him
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:44.160]  that's his move to get out of this because let me tell you if this country goes into lockdown
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:48.800]  over corona virus whether it's deadly or not trump's going to lose support folks
[2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:52.480]  he's going to lose support americans are going to be pissed the economy is going to tank
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:58.800]  and they're going to blame him now the viral outbreak the media can try to blame him trump
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:06.560]  supporters won't do it trump is not god he can't control a viral outbreak so but who knows what
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:12.000]  information trump's getting in his ear uh and who knows what he's thinking but i don't believe he's
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:18.160]  in check or i don't believe he's in checkmate he may be in check so this is the deep state last
[2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:22.800]  ditch effort to try to destroy the trump presidency he needs to go with his last ditch
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:26.800]  ditch effort to destroy them let's go to john in minnesota john make it quick
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:35.680]  yeah i will hi oh can you hear me yep go ahead okay uh hey it all starts with is it or is it not
[2:57:35.680 --> 2:57:41.840]  a bio weapon yep uh if it's a bio weapon trump has got to point it out he's got to trace it right
[2:57:41.840 --> 2:57:48.480]  down to its beginning and we got to go from there if we got a guess between that soup in a weapon
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:54.560]  now uh the other day on joe rogan uh he had an infectious disease experts say it wasn't a bio
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:58:00.320]  weapon his name is michael ousterhoos from the university of minnesota now i'm an you're a young
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:07.040]  uh freedom warrior i'm an old freedom warrior i've got a a virus called covet 19 that also i
[2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:12.400]  nicknamed the boomer remover and so i'm gonna have a different perspective about getting to the
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:17.760]  bottom of this thing quickly i have a death sentence coming my way yeah you know that's a good point
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:22.800]  actually and again we're not getting anything i talked about it last week i mean i don't want to
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:26.320]  be the guys it's like patting ourselves on the back like hey we told you all this was coming but it's
[2:58:26.320 --> 2:58:34.240]  like it just gets frustrating you know playing arm short armchair quarterback essentially but

[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:42.800]  nothing of low life crap the governor of new york andy qualmo born on third base thought he hit a

[3:27:53.520 --> 3:28:01.760]  and you know one of my sayings is that prepare for the worst if the worst doesn't happen and you're
[3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:09.120]  prepared for it you don't lose anything but if you're not prepared and the worst happens
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:19.040]  then you can lose everything now all of a sudden everybody's running to the grocery store

[3:28:52.640 --> 3:29:00.640]  life select storable foods so with the rise of coronavirus and trouble brewing constantly in
[3:29:00.640 --> 3:29:08.160]  other nations and more danger is constantly growing overseas so we've been officially notified
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:13.600]  about a vendor that food prices are on the rise due to dramatically increased level of demand
[3:29:14.320 --> 3:29:18.880]  and so what they're saying is that it's already getting more difficult to order
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:26.080]  storeable foods nationwide and they're facing a five to ten percent increase on every option
[3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:32.000]  of emergency food available and demand for storeable food products remains nearly
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:39.600]  a hundred times normal volume but there is progress to report as of yesterday
[3:29:40.480 --> 3:29:48.560]  two new food production facilities have been open bringing a new total to four food processing plants
[3:29:49.120 --> 3:29:56.240]  when this all started in january there was only one so shipping will be delayed on every order
[3:29:56.240 --> 3:30:04.160]  that they take likely 10 weeks or more used to be nine weeks not all but many cases so knowing

[3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:11.280]  i want to make this 100 clear for everybody listening
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:15.680]  what's happening in the global equity markets
[3:44:15.680 --> 3:44:24.080]  and as we speak the dow is down almost 10 percent and that's after the feds been pumping
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:34.240]  up trillions of dollars 1.5 trillion dollars last week to boost up the equity markets a capitalism

[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:55.440]  and very appropriate for where we are and who we are and what's going on
[3:46:55.440 --> 3:47:07.440]  on what was the day that trump called the state of emergency friday the 13th i had agreed 100
[3:47:07.440 --> 3:47:16.160]  percent with trump in the beginning that this thing was being blown way out and as i my magazine
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:22.160]  says that the prostitutes were the peddlers ratings were slumping very terribly in them in
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:29.200]  the industry it's like when they have a hurricane and all of these uh prostitutes get dressed up in
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:37.760]  their uh hurricane dread and they're out the microphone and the water splashing over the
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:44.720]  boardwalk and the trees bending over and the branches falling the hurricane is 300 miles

[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:02.720]  and then making it up they got that shot we're then making this stuff up too
[3:48:02.720 --> 3:48:13.040]  yep it's exactly what they've done and the people buy it the sheeple bought it
[3:48:16.640 --> 3:48:19.840]  prepare prevail and prosper
[3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:29.280]  gold prices are slumping dramatically you know why they got to sell their gold to cover their margin

[3:53:30.560 --> 3:53:37.040]  the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we
[3:53:37.040 --> 3:53:41.840]  love god and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge
