[00:00.000 --> 00:05.620]  20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars and in the decade
[00:05.620 --> 00:12.440]  since it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions
[00:12.440 --> 00:18.160]  of unique website visitors monthly and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state
[00:18.160 --> 00:20.400]  of the art studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:20.400 --> 00:25.760]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering
[00:25.760 --> 00:31.440]  breaking news, live coverage of special events and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere
[00:31.440 --> 00:32.440]  else.
[00:32.440 --> 00:37.440]  While the old-guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation
[00:37.440 --> 00:43.200]  and technology, InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[00:43.200 --> 00:48.840]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.520]  of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we entered.
[00:54.520 --> 01:01.200]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis for high-profile interviews and bombshell
[01:01.200 --> 01:09.880]  revelations, except no substitutes, demand truth, demand InfoWars.
[01:09.880 --> 01:22.680]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.440]  Well, we've got this whole Schneiderman situation, who's the right-hand man of the incredibly
[01:28.440 --> 01:35.520]  corrupt governor, who has his other corrupt brother that works over at CNN.
[01:35.520 --> 01:44.320]  And we've got Schneiderman, who is caught right dead center in the fact that he's the
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.960]  guy in charge of the whole Harvey Weinstein cover-up.
[01:49.960 --> 01:55.840]  So we have that situation, and it just shows how incestuous and out of control the Democratic
[01:55.840 --> 02:04.040]  Party is, and he's now resigning over all these women coming out, saying that he basically
[02:04.040 --> 02:07.680]  beat them up, slapped them around, sexually assaulted them.
[02:07.680 --> 02:14.080]  Well, that's what these gangster thugs do, and the guy is just a creep fest, even looking
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.080]  at him.
[02:15.080 --> 02:19.920]  But who do you think covers up for all this stuff in New York?
[02:19.920 --> 02:22.200]  People like Schneiderman.
[02:22.200 --> 02:24.160]  We've got these really creepy videos coming up.
[02:24.160 --> 02:27.640]  Steve Watts has got an article about it on infowars.com.
[02:27.640 --> 02:29.080]  This didn't age well.
[02:29.080 --> 02:40.680]  Samantha Bee described Schneiderman as a superhero who could stop Trump and his sexual abuse.
[02:40.680 --> 02:43.320]  Isn't that just classic?
[02:43.320 --> 02:46.400]  Isn't that just amazing?
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.920]  Now, that said, that's a big piece of news.
[02:52.920 --> 02:57.800]  It just shows the incredible hypocrisy of these people.
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.040]  But the even bigger news when we come back is something we already knew.
[03:02.040 --> 03:04.680]  It was in the court records.
[03:04.680 --> 03:08.960]  It was in the CPS records.
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.800]  It was in the Department of Families records about a week after the Parkland shooting back
[03:15.800 --> 03:19.440]  in February.
[03:19.440 --> 03:21.360]  And the media would just say it's not true.
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.000]  It's an Alex Jones conspiracy theory.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.920]  It's a Fox News conspiracy theory that Nick Cruz was in a leftist program that even if
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.960]  you commit all sorts of crimes, if you are a minority, I guess because he has the name
[03:34.960 --> 03:35.960]  Cruz.
[03:35.960 --> 03:36.960]  He's supposedly Hispanic.
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.400]  Even though he was adopted, didn't look Hispanic to me, but whatever.
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.360]  Whatever black or Asian or anything else but white, you don't go to jail.
[03:47.360 --> 03:49.600]  And they had denied that he was part of that.
[03:49.600 --> 04:00.040]  But now the Sun Sentinel, WJCTTV, they're all reporting it's confirmed.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.500]  What's the future of Broward County's promise program after news Nick Cruz was referred
[04:04.500 --> 04:06.400]  there and was part of it?
[04:06.400 --> 04:15.400]  Stoneman Douglas Shooter was assigned a controversial Broward County program officials admit.
[04:15.400 --> 04:18.360]  He was put into this in 2013.
[04:18.360 --> 04:20.760]  He was allowed to say, I'm going to kill people.
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.920]  I'm going to murder you.
[04:21.920 --> 04:27.680]  He was known as Mr. School Shooter and then there was a stand down that day.
[04:27.680 --> 04:31.400]  Now what they do to our videos the week of the attack with eyewitnesses and local news
[04:31.400 --> 04:33.920]  reports saying they stood down.
[04:33.920 --> 04:41.040]  They deleted them, CNN called for us to be banned and said that we said no one died.
[04:41.040 --> 04:48.080]  And now they're in the Washington Post claiming that I said not just that Emma Gonzalez was
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.080]  a crisis actor, which I didn't say, but that I blame some other woman in another state
[04:52.080 --> 04:54.200]  and that I need to be sued.
[04:54.200 --> 05:01.400]  Total defamation, total fraud by criminal media.
[05:01.400 --> 05:05.840]  Our Secretary of State John Kerry has been having secret meetings with foreign officials
[05:05.840 --> 05:11.040]  to keep the U.S. in the Iran nuclear deal and President Trump is not having it.
[05:11.040 --> 05:15.760]  Kerry was one of the key architects of the Iran deal, which was signed in 2015 and the
[05:15.760 --> 05:21.160]  Boston Globe reported last week that he'd been quietly meeting with Iranian and EU officials
[05:21.160 --> 05:24.800]  in recent months to strategize how to save his legacy.
[05:24.800 --> 05:29.960]  Trump tweeted the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy
[05:29.960 --> 05:32.480]  on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.
[05:32.480 --> 05:35.760]  He was the one that curated this mess in the first place.
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.520]  President Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal, calling it one of the worst and
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.520]  most one-sided transactions the U.S. has ever entered into.
[05:43.520 --> 05:49.000]  Back in February of 2017, President Trump tweeted Iran was on its last legs and ready
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.520]  to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran
[05:53.520 --> 06:06.400]  deal, $150 billion.
[06:06.400 --> 06:14.000]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[06:14.000 --> 06:35.360]  Jones show.
[06:35.360 --> 06:42.040]  The only thing that can surpass the evil and outright corruption of the globalist, of
[06:42.040 --> 06:48.680]  the leftist, of communist around the world is their incredible hypocrisy, their legendary
[06:48.680 --> 06:52.560]  fraud where they say that rich people are bad but they're the richest people in the
[06:52.560 --> 07:00.120]  world and shut up tax-exempt programs for themselves where they have diplomatic immunity.
[07:00.120 --> 07:05.200]  And part of that arrogance is that they're constantly caught in brutal sex crimes against
[07:05.200 --> 07:12.880]  men, women, and children, whether it's Harvey Weinstein or whether it's Bill Clinton.
[07:12.880 --> 07:22.040]  And now you have New York's AG Eric Snyderman, the right-hand man of the gangster kingpin,
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.480]  Governor Cuomo and his hit-and-run drunk driving brother over on CNN.
[07:27.480 --> 07:33.920]  Well, Mr. Creepy Eyes has all these credible women coming forward saying he would beat
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.720]  the living daylights out of him and then sexually assault him.
[07:38.720 --> 07:45.880]  Well, that fits into the thuggery of Cuomo that said two years ago, if you're a Christian
[07:45.880 --> 07:51.720]  or you're a conservative or you're pro-life, get the bleep out of New York.
[07:51.720 --> 07:54.440]  And the media said a few days later to Cuomo, they said, you don't mean that.
[07:54.440 --> 07:57.560]  And he said, I mean it, get out of here.
[07:57.560 --> 08:00.880]  We're going to run you out.
[08:00.880 --> 08:03.400]  These are bullies.
[08:03.400 --> 08:06.080]  These are thugs.
[08:06.080 --> 08:17.480]  And I want to play a clip here of Samantha Bee, another force-fed, failed comic describing
[08:17.480 --> 08:22.440]  Snyderman as a, quote, superhero who would stop Trump.
[08:22.440 --> 08:27.080]  Now remember, Trump was talking about Elvis when he'd have all the teenage girls pulling
[08:27.080 --> 08:32.920]  their panties off and throwing them at him when he first became a super hit in the 1950s.
[08:32.920 --> 08:36.440]  And Trump was saying, women will climb up on top of you.
[08:36.440 --> 08:41.160]  They'll jump on top of you and they'll just let you, you know, go right at it.
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.960]  No women have ever accused him of assault, Stormy Daniels said he treated really nice.
[08:46.960 --> 08:50.400]  Her response is, you know, she wants him to resign on and on and on.
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.520]  But she said, are you going to lead us out of darkness as feminist progressive comedians
[08:55.520 --> 09:02.440]  like Samantha Bee of Democratic New York attorney, Eric Snyderman?
[09:02.440 --> 09:06.320]  And look, it's not just one photo of him that's really creepy.
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.320]  This morning I was looking at photos of him and last night, so I clicked on Google images
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.560]  and I don't really go to Google as much as I went over to Bing images and I clicked it
[09:15.560 --> 09:21.400]  and it's just every photo, if you saw this guy walking down the street at night, you'd
[09:21.400 --> 09:23.240]  think he was like a vampire or something.
[09:23.240 --> 09:33.920]  I mean, he looks so crazed, so aggressive, so out of control, so completely arrogant.
[09:33.920 --> 09:42.160]  And the women are saying that again, he brutally beat the living snot out of him and sexually
[09:42.160 --> 09:43.160]  assaulted him.
[09:43.160 --> 09:48.040]  If a woman didn't give him what he wanted, I mean, look at this photo, document cam shot
[09:48.040 --> 09:49.600]  please for TV viewers.
[09:49.600 --> 09:54.000]  Look at that crazed maniac.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.960]  There's just something about these evil people.
[09:55.960 --> 10:02.360]  It's like Skelter has that look, Hillary has that look.
[10:02.360 --> 10:08.920]  They have this evil look that is like right out of American Psycho.
[10:08.920 --> 10:11.840]  You can really judge the book by its cover with this guy.
[10:11.840 --> 10:16.160]  Here, let me try to make the face right now for TV viewers.
[10:16.160 --> 10:18.160]  Hi.
[10:18.160 --> 10:20.760]  Let me post this photo.
[10:20.760 --> 10:28.360]  Hi, I'm Brian Skelter and it's like, do they not know how psychotic they look?
[10:28.360 --> 10:34.000]  But they think that that's power.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.880]  They think looking like a complete lunatic is good because they're around all these other
[10:38.880 --> 10:46.200]  yes men and women in government and they just stomp around all day on these power trips.
[10:46.200 --> 10:50.440]  Their latest talking point is I recycled one on Trump that he's not fit.
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.440]  He's embarrassed the presidency.
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.880]  When they're the ones attacking the presidency like never before, they always say, oh, criticize
[10:57.880 --> 11:04.080]  even Bush or Clinton or Obama because you know, it'll hurt the presidency.
[11:04.080 --> 11:06.040]  But now they're saying Trump has hurt the presidency.
[11:06.040 --> 11:14.000]  These people are a permanent so-called ruling class of sycophantic kleptocrats and they
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.200]  can't believe they're being thrown from power.
[11:17.200 --> 11:26.760]  Eric Schneiderman called me his brown slave would slap me until I called him master.
[11:26.760 --> 11:29.920]  Now when you look at his face, do you believe that?
[11:29.920 --> 11:35.600]  And you look at his thuggest statements and his actions and you look at how, oh, here's
[11:35.600 --> 11:37.000]  the big one.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.840]  He ran the Harvey Weinstein investigation a couple of years ago.
[11:40.840 --> 11:47.080]  They got shut down even though women, multiple women was it seven women are known to have
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.720]  gone to the police and said Weinstein right me in the back of a car Weinstein rate me
[11:51.720 --> 11:54.440]  in a shower Weinstein rate me in a hotel room.
[11:54.440 --> 12:02.360]  He Weinstein rate me in a closet and then you've got the driver of Weinstein.
[12:02.360 --> 12:06.280]  You've got the butler of Weinstein all saying he would rape women.
[12:06.280 --> 12:11.520]  He likes 95, 100 pound women that look like they're 15 years old, these are quotes and
[12:11.520 --> 12:20.000]  Weinstein pins them with his huge 300 pound weight and rapes them.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  Now what does that earn?
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  People like Schneiderman.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.360]  Well, it earns him this.
[12:28.360 --> 12:35.600]  So here's the feminist progressive teaching that if a guy asks you out, it's rape and
[12:35.600 --> 12:43.880]  it was for women accused him of physical abuse and of course, sexual activities.
[12:43.880 --> 12:44.880]  But it's getting a lot bigger.
[12:44.880 --> 12:49.320]  Remember, he was the me too guy.
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.960]  So let's go ahead and roll Samantha B. Here it is.
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.440]  Today is November 8th, which means Donald Trump was elected president exactly 100 years
[12:58.440 --> 12:59.440]  ago.
[12:59.440 --> 13:00.440]  I'm kidding.
[13:00.440 --> 13:01.440]  It's only been a year.
[13:01.440 --> 13:08.800]  Oh my, where'd this come from?
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.440]  President Bonesburg has had more endurance than predicted, especially if you were predicting
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.440]  his endurance by looking at literally any photo of him being physical ever.
[13:18.440 --> 13:20.760]  But there is hope on the horizon.
[13:20.760 --> 13:23.840]  A hero who stood up to democracy's nemesis before.
[13:23.840 --> 13:25.960]  Look up in the sky.
[13:25.960 --> 13:26.960]  It's a bird.
[13:26.960 --> 13:27.960]  It's a plane.
[13:27.960 --> 13:28.960]  It's.
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.160]  I'm Eric Schneiderman and I'm the attorney general of the state of New York, the lawyer
[13:32.160 --> 13:35.440]  for the state of New York and for the people of the state of New York.
[13:35.440 --> 13:36.440]  Happy one year's anniversary.
[13:36.440 --> 13:37.440]  Oh, thank you.
[13:37.440 --> 13:38.440]  He must be so happy that Trump won because he's giving you so much material.
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.440]  What a great time to be an attorney.
[13:39.440 --> 13:50.200]  Yeah, it's like a toxic volcano that just keeps belching out bad public policies.
[13:50.200 --> 13:52.480]  But we have a very strong legal resistance.
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.040]  Are you going to lead us out of the darkness?
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.480]  State attorneys general, we're going to be the first line of defense because the constitution
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.920]  kept a lot of power at the state level to hold potential tyrant in check.
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.480]  We have that power now and with great power comes great responsibility.
[14:06.480 --> 14:07.480]  Oh my God.
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.480]  He's.
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.480]  Schneiderman.
[14:09.480 --> 14:10.480]  Schneiderman.
[14:10.480 --> 14:18.720]  Because whenever a Schneider can, all he can say is, no, it is not going to be one
[14:18.720 --> 14:19.720]  hero.
[14:19.720 --> 14:20.920]  It's not going to be a quick fix for this.
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.440]  But I got colleagues all around the country, a network of progressive attorneys general
[14:25.440 --> 14:27.640]  who are really in the core of the legal resistance.
[14:27.640 --> 14:29.680]  You are fighting the good fight.
[14:29.680 --> 14:30.680]  Many fights.
[14:30.680 --> 14:34.360]  So if we had a meeting in January before Trump took office, we hadn't anticipated what was
[14:34.360 --> 14:35.360]  coming.
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.120]  So you assembled your anti-Trump squad of attorney generals?
[14:39.120 --> 14:40.120]  Attorneys general.
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.120]  Like curls, junior.
[14:41.120 --> 14:42.120]  Uh, almost.
[14:42.120 --> 14:48.360]  And Eric's Justice League has challenged Trump over the first travel ban pesticide student
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.760]  loans, the second travel ban smog, methane, Obamacare subsidies, stock on the third travel
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.080]  ban, trans rights, queen power plan and birth control access.
[14:55.080 --> 14:56.240]  We beat him on travel ban one.
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.400]  We beat him on travel ban two.
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.760]  We beat him on environmental regulations and a transgender military ban and we will continue
[15:01.760 --> 15:02.760]  to fight.
[15:02.760 --> 15:03.760]  Uh-huh.
[15:03.760 --> 15:04.760]  You are a superhero.
[15:04.760 --> 15:05.760]  No.
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.520]  Why don't we see what happens if you go into that telephone booth over there?
[15:11.520 --> 15:18.160]  Trump tweeted in 2013 when some people got caught engaging sexual crimes and pervert
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.600]  activities that wait until Schneiderman got exposed and that he was the worst.
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.200]  Wiener is gone, Spitzer is gone, next will be lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman.
[15:30.200 --> 15:31.360]  Is he a crook?
[15:31.360 --> 15:32.360]  Wait and see.
[15:32.360 --> 15:35.200]  Worse than Spitzer and Wiener.
[15:35.200 --> 15:41.720]  And Wiener, it's, you know, young people, children, and Spitzer, it's massade operatives.
[15:41.720 --> 15:42.720]  So there you go.
[15:42.720 --> 15:44.040]  Trump knows what's going on.
[15:44.040 --> 15:46.120]  Trump knows where the bodies are buried.
[15:46.120 --> 15:47.440]  And it's all part of their legal resistance.
[15:47.440 --> 15:53.320]  Yeah, all the fake lawsuits against me, everybody else, it's all part trying to bully America.
[15:53.320 --> 15:55.720]  Good luck, scum, you want to fight?

[16:59.320 --> 17:04.480]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[17:04.480 --> 17:08.440]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[17:08.440 --> 17:09.440]  my family to freedom.
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.320]  Today, we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool
[17:14.320 --> 17:17.440]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[17:39.480 --> 17:40.480]  government ever.

[17:45.440 --> 17:46.440]  shadow government.
[17:46.440 --> 17:49.280]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.280]  are.

[20:25.720 --> 20:39.320]  You know, we got the left of all these out-of-control attorney generals and lawyers' guilds, suing
[20:39.320 --> 20:43.600]  every nationalist, every capitalist, every pro-American patriot in the country.
[20:43.600 --> 20:47.160]  Just basically everybody's being sued in an attempt to intimidate us and make us back
[20:47.160 --> 20:48.160]  down.
[20:48.160 --> 20:49.160]  Not going to happen.
[20:49.160 --> 20:54.440]  We're honored to fight for this country and we realize giving into your tyranny is a hundred
[20:54.440 --> 20:56.800]  times worse than fighting you and defeating you.
[20:56.800 --> 21:01.360]  In fact, fighting you and defeating you is ecstasy and we are winning.
[21:01.360 --> 21:02.360]  Make no mistake.
[21:02.360 --> 21:03.360]  I don't operate like the globalists.
[21:03.360 --> 21:04.840]  If we were losing, I'd tell you.
[21:04.840 --> 21:09.080]  We are winning, but they are panicking and they are exerting their full force trying
[21:09.080 --> 21:14.080]  to stop the re-insurgence of nationalism, not just here but worldwide.
[21:14.080 --> 21:23.880]  Now, next segment, because it's longer, when I read this last night at about 10 o'clock,
[21:23.880 --> 21:30.400]  I got so angry that despite the fact that I was sleepy, I couldn't go to bed for a couple
[21:30.400 --> 21:41.280]  hours and it makes me mad because in hindsight, you can see their designs.
[21:41.280 --> 21:48.280]  In hindsight, you can see what they did and you can see what they're planning to do again
[21:48.280 --> 21:56.720]  and again and again and again and again and again.
[21:56.720 --> 22:04.600]  Trump pointed out that 98 percent of mass shootings happen in victim disarmament zones
[22:04.600 --> 22:06.600]  at the NRA speech he gave.
[22:06.600 --> 22:08.000]  The media attacked that.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.600]  They said, is it really true?
[22:10.600 --> 22:15.720]  And then, obfuscated, they never really even answered it, but it is true.
[22:15.720 --> 22:21.600]  Mass shootings kill less than 50 people a year, by the way, in schools, but they pump
[22:21.600 --> 22:24.280]  it all up and then tell gun owners we're all to blame.
[22:24.280 --> 22:31.320]  It's all about projecting guilt, but last night, it came out in the sunset and it came
[22:31.320 --> 22:40.080]  out in local TV, Broward County went okay for four years, four plus, excuse me, four
[22:40.080 --> 22:41.520]  and a half.
[22:41.520 --> 22:53.040]  Dick Cruz was in a thing called Promise Program that Google's pushing, where you let people
[22:53.040 --> 22:56.800]  off for crimes, but only if they're a minority.
[22:56.800 --> 23:00.360]  I happen to have a stack of news here just today.
[23:00.360 --> 23:07.480]  Every day there's a stack from Belgium, from France, from Sweden, from Finland, where
[23:07.480 --> 23:13.120]  Islamist rape, in fact, will you pull me yesterday's stack, some of that was in there, 10-year-old
[23:13.120 --> 23:20.640]  girls, 80-something-year-old women, you name it, and are allowed off saying it's their culture.
[23:20.640 --> 23:27.840]  It's like importing New Guinea headhunters and saying they're allowed to, you know, kill
[23:27.840 --> 23:31.440]  your wife and shrink her head.
[23:31.440 --> 23:37.200]  But that's true authoritarianism, and then here it is confirmed when we already knew
[23:37.200 --> 23:45.800]  this, this came out a week after, but the media said we were liars, and then it didn't
[23:45.800 --> 23:46.800]  exist.
[23:46.800 --> 23:50.680]  I'm going to cover that next segment, I'm already getting into it, and then now it's
[23:50.680 --> 23:54.800]  all confirmed, but only in the local news.
[23:54.800 --> 23:59.000]  They stood down, the police physically stood down, they knew what he was planning.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.360]  This was a false flag, folks, but not in the way they claim I said it was a false flag.
[24:03.360 --> 24:09.200]  Real people died, the anti-gun four students that went around, you know, from the 3,000
[24:09.200 --> 24:13.660]  and got all the attention, they weren't crisis actors, I never said that, and the media smoke
[24:13.660 --> 24:19.600]  screened what they really did by lying about what I said, and that makes me mad.
[24:19.600 --> 24:24.040]  Not for me, but what you did to those kids and those families, and you know full well
[24:24.040 --> 24:30.040]  what you did, globalist, MSM, and then you use lies about me to smoke screen how you
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.760]  stood down, and you let him go in there and kill those people, and I'm sick of your crap,
[24:35.760 --> 24:41.720]  and I'm going to get you, and my listeners are going to get you, because when we come
[24:41.720 --> 24:50.360]  back there's a new wrinkle, they're saying again that I said nobody died, and I've got
[24:50.360 --> 24:55.240]  a woman on there saying I send in people after her with no proof, and I've got to sue the
[24:55.240 --> 24:59.800]  Washington Post, but it's Bezos, he's got, he makes 12 billion dollars a day.
[24:59.800 --> 25:09.520]  A week and a half ago, and you read it and they just say, Jones told people it was her
[25:09.520 --> 25:14.040]  some 30-something year old woman, I never said any such thing, and of course they don't
[25:14.040 --> 25:22.560]  show the proof, and then they set it up where this woman's the victim of me, and I didn't
[25:22.560 --> 25:27.960]  do Jack Squat, they're the ones putting her out there, they're the ones saying this stuff,
[25:27.960 --> 25:36.480]  but I'm going to break it all down coming up, it's just incredible how the media and
[25:36.480 --> 25:45.600]  these lawyers are completely psychotic, they have no morals, in fact they're stupid because
[25:45.600 --> 25:49.360]  this is destroying them, people are learning about their lives, they're learning how they
[25:49.360 --> 25:55.320]  do this, we have the thinkers, they have the deranged losers, and want to be victims that
[25:55.320 --> 25:59.640]  sign on to all this so they can have their 15 minutes of fame, because after all, Alex
[25:59.640 --> 26:06.760]  Jones is bad and he deserves to be lied about.
[26:06.760 --> 26:13.200]  So the Washington Post, Bezos are just monsters, and by the way, Bezos Bezos has banned Christians
[26:13.200 --> 26:19.920]  from the charity program on there, every church in this country and every Christian should
[26:19.920 --> 26:27.720]  be boycotting Amazon, I'm going to go to break it, I'm going to come back, I'm going to go
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.200]  through the actual articles, it makes me so upset to know they knowingly knew it, they
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.960]  all called him the school shooter for years, they knew he was coming, they stood down,
[26:37.960 --> 26:42.800]  he was in foster care, his parents had mysteriously died, he was all wound up on government issued
[26:42.800 --> 26:49.320]  drugs, he shows up and the police stand down, no wonder they jumped on me day one and said
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.600]  don't say it staged, because it was staged in that they stood down and knew he was coming
[26:54.600 --> 27:00.280]  and had all the PR ready, that's why they were so scared and up front saying Jones says
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.360]  nobody died, Jones says they're all actors, Jones says it's staged, because it wasn't
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.920]  staged in that people died, but they knew and they stood down, wow, the article from
[27:09.920 --> 27:15.120]  information liberation is on infowars.com, it's excellent article, I want to get that
[27:15.120 --> 27:22.200]  Chris author on Chris, I pronounced his name, too far away on the screen there, I want to
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.840]  get him on, he's a really smart writer, but this is just crazy, anti-racism program,
[27:27.840 --> 27:33.680]  okay, before I go any further, we have Ikerman back in stock, it came out four months ago,

[31:12.080 --> 31:18.720]  that in our local areas as well, and as a long time info wars listener, I want to say
[31:18.720 --> 31:23.480]  thanks for the awesome brain force anthroplex, my girlfriend would like to say thanks for
[31:23.480 --> 31:24.480]  the anthroplex.
[31:24.480 --> 31:25.480]  Thank you.
[31:25.480 --> 31:29.520]  I use the bio true selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[31:29.520 --> 31:34.320]  toothpaste fans, the super blue is awesome, and thank you so much Alex for the info wars
[31:34.320 --> 31:39.320]  life products, they are quality, I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for
[31:39.320 --> 31:41.320]  doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[31:41.320 --> 31:47.440]  Absolutely, because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[31:47.440 --> 31:51.760]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in
[31:51.760 --> 32:00.440]  order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[32:00.440 --> 32:06.760]  I'm so excited, the new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[32:06.760 --> 32:13.280]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill, this is a heart and brain
[32:13.280 --> 32:19.080]  pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's
[32:19.080 --> 32:20.080]  beyond that.
[32:20.080 --> 32:26.040]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[32:26.040 --> 32:32.640]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people 100-200 dollars for the formulae,
[32:32.640 --> 32:37.680]  and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[32:37.680 --> 32:44.320]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[32:44.320 --> 32:48.760]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[32:48.760 --> 32:53.240]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[32:53.240 --> 33:03.480]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[33:03.480 --> 33:07.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:07.320 --> 33:19.240]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[33:19.240 --> 33:25.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[33:25.240 --> 33:30.240]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to man, you win some, lose some, and kill the
[33:30.240 --> 33:31.240]  same to me.
[33:31.240 --> 33:40.240]  The pleasure is to play, my little devil is what you say.
[33:40.240 --> 33:53.240]  I will save me, the only God I need is the ace of spades, the ace of spades.
[33:53.240 --> 33:57.880]  All right, I will get into the ultramassive news, and I was saying I would break down
[33:57.880 --> 34:05.040]  this segment because the other breaking news just came out, but if you just joined us,
[34:05.040 --> 34:11.480]  ladies and gentlemen, it is critical to know they've now confirmed that there were multiple
[34:11.480 --> 34:13.600]  stand downs in Parkland.
[34:13.600 --> 34:15.960]  The sheriff's department physically stood down.
[34:15.960 --> 34:22.520]  They were warned dozens of times, 22 times that the shooter was planning to kill people.
[34:22.520 --> 34:31.520]  He was known for years as the school shooter, and now it's confirmed starting in 2013.
[34:31.520 --> 34:36.360]  School shooter Nicholas Cruz was shielded from arrest to fight systemic racism.
[34:36.360 --> 34:42.920]  That's now in the Sun Sentinel News, it's now in the local television news.
[34:42.920 --> 34:48.400]  They said that the school and the county lied and said that he wasn't, but that he was because
[34:48.400 --> 34:51.280]  you have to fight racism.
[34:51.280 --> 34:59.240]  You cannot allow someone who has a Spanish last name to go to jail.
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.160]  And Google has also announced that they're not going to allow Bales bonds ads because
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.960]  it's racist because minorities are in jail.
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.440]  So they shouldn't be able to find a Bales bondsman.
[35:12.440 --> 35:15.480]  You heard me right.
[35:15.480 --> 35:17.600]  This is the whole black lives matter.
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.040]  Don't put anybody in prison move to virtue signal.
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.600]  And then they time and time again, let the person out.
[35:27.600 --> 35:30.360]  Because Cruz was adopted, he wasn't even Hispanic.
[35:30.360 --> 35:37.360]  This is insane, but that ties into Europe where they let Muslims rape people.
[35:37.360 --> 35:38.800]  I'm going to tie it all together.
[35:38.800 --> 35:48.360]  And then this incredible news, disinformation, the Washington Post saying that info wars
[35:48.360 --> 35:55.600]  blamed some woman for being a crisis actor and saying that she was Emma Gonzalez because
[35:55.600 --> 35:59.440]  her name's the same, we never did any such thing.
[35:59.440 --> 36:03.280]  Emma Gonzalez is the young shaved head girl.
[36:03.280 --> 36:05.240]  There's an anti-gun activist.
[36:05.240 --> 36:06.800]  They just lie and say this.
[36:06.800 --> 36:07.800]  Look at this poor lady.
[36:07.800 --> 36:13.440]  Alex Jones says she's an actress, total lies.
[36:13.440 --> 36:18.080]  Crisis actors did not say that, but again, they just keep retreading this and retreading
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.160]  it and retreading it and retreading it and retreading it and I guess the media goes to
[36:24.160 --> 36:27.400]  this lady and tells her I said this about her, but notice they don't show me in the
[36:27.400 --> 36:28.840]  Washington Post saying it.
[36:28.840 --> 36:34.080]  That's coming up next segment.
[36:34.080 --> 36:44.920]  But now, the big news, ladies and gentlemen, this just broke minutes ago.
[36:44.920 --> 36:50.240]  It's on infowars.com and newswars.com from Reuters.
[36:50.240 --> 36:56.200]  Trump tells Macron U.S. to pull out of Iran nuclear deal.
[36:56.200 --> 37:03.120]  New York Times is saying U.S. President Donald Trump told President of France Emmanuel Macron
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.960]  today that the United States was going to pull out of the international nuclear agreement
[37:06.960 --> 37:07.960]  with Iran.
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.320]  The New York Times reported citing a person briefed on the conversation.
[37:11.320 --> 37:17.040]  The source to the United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as
[37:17.040 --> 37:23.200]  part of the deal and impose additional economic penalties the Times reported.
[37:23.200 --> 37:29.240]  Trump is to make an announcement on the Iran deal at 2 p.m. coming up.
[37:29.240 --> 37:31.160]  That'll be in about an hour.
[37:31.160 --> 37:32.520]  That's 2 p.m. Eastern.
[37:32.520 --> 37:38.520]  One senior European official closely involved with Iran diplomacy told Reuters U.S. officials
[37:38.520 --> 37:42.880]  had indicated late on Monday that Trump would withdraw from the agreement, but remained
[37:42.880 --> 37:47.200]  unclear on what terms and whatever sanctions would be imposed.
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.360]  The 2015 deal signature foreign policy achievement of Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, eased
[37:52.360 --> 37:57.360]  sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from being
[37:57.360 --> 38:00.160]  able to make an atomic bomb.
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.800]  Trump has frequently criticized the Iran Accord because it does not address Iran's ballistic
[38:05.800 --> 38:11.160]  missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025, nor its role in conflicts in Yemen and
[38:11.160 --> 38:13.160]  Syria.
[38:13.160 --> 38:26.560]  So we will look at all of that as it unfolds today.
[38:26.560 --> 38:35.480]  Now wait till we get to the news in the next segment because it ties into China not letting
[38:35.480 --> 38:40.800]  people that criticize the government buy, sell, or trade, or leave the country or even travel.
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.680]  So the U.K. now is officially doing this all the time versus Dan Lyman's story up on
[38:46.680 --> 38:53.680]  EuropeWars.com or European Bureau, U.K. banned Norwegian anti-migration activists who lives
[38:53.680 --> 38:55.920]  in London.
[38:55.920 --> 39:05.360]  So more and more the travel bans are in effect very, very, very serious police state.
[39:05.360 --> 39:14.440]  And then coming up, the New York Observer owned by the president's son-in-law that's
[39:14.440 --> 39:19.280]  so anti-Trump it makes your head spin, I'm not anti-Jerry Custer and I know that the
[39:19.280 --> 39:26.080]  company is in a blind trust now that he works in the White House but come on, man.
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.280]  Trump's a rapist, Alex Jones is a criminal, I mean it's one of the worst foaming at the
[39:30.280 --> 39:37.080]  amount of publications and here they are breathlessly, Hollywood warned celebrities will
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.560]  choose the red pill, a la Kanye, and that more are about to break out and that we've
[39:42.560 --> 39:48.000]  got to do something, Brett Easton Ellis warns more celebrities will choose the red pill.
[39:48.000 --> 39:56.120]  Oh my goodness, but don't worry, there's a new lineup of alt-right, new right that are
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.360]  outside the box and then the New York Times has an article, Meet the Renegades of the
[40:01.360 --> 40:12.000]  Intellectual Dark Web and it's got Ben Shapiro in here and it calls him a prince.
[40:12.000 --> 40:23.840]  The New York Times calls him a prince and it just says he is such a wonderful prince.
[40:23.840 --> 40:32.320]  It says once IDW folks saw that people like Ben Shapiro were generally smart, highly informed
[40:32.320 --> 40:41.720]  and often princely in difficult conversations but then meanwhile next paragraph that unlike
[40:41.720 --> 40:48.640]  Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich that people don't take seriously, there's a high probability
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.840]  that you're either cynical or stupid, see you're cynical or stupid if you talk to Alex
[40:53.840 --> 41:00.200]  Jones or Mike Cernovich but Mike Shapiro's a prince, you have to understand the only
[41:00.200 --> 41:03.760]  thing that could hurt him for wars would be the New York Times endorsing us like this.
[41:03.760 --> 41:10.600]  I don't want to be in big color spreads and the New York Times is the reasonable thinkers.
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.760]  You know people that are off the reservation, they're the new right even though none of
[41:14.760 --> 41:22.040]  them are really even right wing and you can trust them, they're good, Jordan Peterson,
[41:22.040 --> 41:35.200]  Ben Shapiro, see I've seen them everywhere pushing them as the good guys.
[41:35.200 --> 41:37.440]  They're in control now, they're the boss.
[41:37.440 --> 41:45.800]  Who as I tell you, you are now under my trance, come to me, I am Ben Shapiro, come to me.
[41:45.800 --> 41:50.400]  And it's just a joke how they're force feeding the New Glenn Beck and let me tell you the
[41:50.400 --> 41:56.560]  second model is not even as good as the first but I'm telling you, I see it everywhere,
[41:56.560 --> 42:02.760]  Jones is evil, shut him down, he needs to be silent, Ben Shapiro's a prince.
[42:02.760 --> 42:08.080]  Can you imagine the New York Times said Alex Jones is so smart, he's such a prince and
[42:08.080 --> 42:13.480]  that's always the PR, so smart, so intellectual.
[42:13.480 --> 42:21.040]  He said Alex Jones is awful, everyone started fawning going, oh that's so intellectual.
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.160]  That's what I'm telling you, the New York Times calls me all the time once they do spreads
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.640]  and shoots and I just say nope, make up whatever you're going to make up.
[42:30.640 --> 42:34.600]  So I've learned my lesson and let me tell Joe Rogan something who's a good guy who's
[42:34.600 --> 42:39.240]  in this, he's another one of the safe guys, the good New York Times says he's a good guy.
[42:39.240 --> 42:42.240]  When they're done with us, if they're successful, they're going to get you next, they don't
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.680]  like anybody that's independent.
[42:44.680 --> 42:49.600]  I would spend 10 seconds being caught dead in the New York Times but you can learn in
[42:49.600 --> 42:54.360]  this article who the good guys are, thank God the New York Times says I'm a bad guy and
[42:54.360 --> 42:55.360]  then I'm not a prince.
[42:55.360 --> 42:57.520]  That's how you think you need to know about Ben Shapiro?
[42:57.520 --> 43:00.600]  The New York Times endorses him.
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.840]  Former Secretary of State John Kerry has been having secret meetings with foreign officials
[43:04.840 --> 43:10.040]  to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal and President Trump is not having it.
[43:10.040 --> 43:14.760]  Kerry was one of the key architects of the Iran deal which was signed in 2015 and the
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.160]  Boston Globe reported last week that he'd been quietly meeting with Iranian and EU officials
[43:20.160 --> 43:23.800]  in recent months to strategize how to save his legacy.
[43:23.800 --> 43:28.920]  Trump tweeted the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy
[43:28.920 --> 43:31.480]  on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.760]  He was the one that created this mess in the first place.
[43:34.760 --> 43:38.520]  President Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal calling it one of the worst and
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.520]  most one-sided transactions the US has ever entered into.
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.000]  Back in February of 2017, President Trump tweeted Iran was on its last legs and ready
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.280]  to collapse until the US came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal.

[47:55.800 --> 47:58.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are Backline Broadcasting Worldwide.
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.640]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[48:03.640 --> 48:13.720]  We are going to get into an incredible miscarriage of justice, an outrageous crime committed against
[48:13.720 --> 48:25.000]  the young men and women of Parkland High School in Florida on Valentine's Day 2018.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.880]  It is now confirmed, it is now even mainstream news that the Sheriff's Department, not one
[48:30.880 --> 48:37.560]  deputy, not four deputies but more than 15 deputies, stood down just as witnesses that
[48:37.560 --> 48:45.000]  day and the day after on our broadcast said they witnessed.
[48:45.000 --> 48:52.720]  We had one witness on, a young African-American man, and Snopes said he was an actor from
[48:52.720 --> 48:58.280]  another city that I had on my show, days later they had to remove it.
[48:58.280 --> 49:08.960]  So they're doing what I said, they're doing what they claim I do.
[49:08.960 --> 49:13.520]  They're doing what they say I did but didn't do.
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.960]  Now here's the big breaking news that just makes me so angry I can hardly talk, not because
[49:18.960 --> 49:22.120]  they're demonizing me, not because they're trying to destroy my name.
[49:22.120 --> 49:26.960]  I signed up for this to hit the bar bar but because they think you're so stupid and I
[49:26.960 --> 49:33.440]  don't know what to do because they need to be punished for it.
[49:33.440 --> 49:36.520]  I'm going to get to what they're doing to Info Wars and the American people in just
[49:36.520 --> 49:40.440]  a moment but first let's get into what they did to those students that day.
[49:40.440 --> 49:49.280]  They stood down and now the Sun Sentinel and two local TV stations have the documents,
[49:49.280 --> 49:55.680]  there's an excellent article by Chris Minahan on InformationLiberation.com, it's posted
[49:55.680 --> 50:04.840]  on InfoWars.com, confirmed school shooter Nicholas Cruz was shielded from arrest to
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.800]  fight systemic racism all over the country in blue cities that already have the highest
[50:09.800 --> 50:23.280]  crime rates by far, so everyone knows Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Maryland, D.C., Miami,
[50:23.280 --> 50:26.840]  L.A., Oakland, you want me to stop?
[50:26.840 --> 50:32.880]  Everybody knows that, Houston's blue city, really bad crime.
[50:32.880 --> 50:38.240]  So confirmed school shooter Nicholas Cruz was shielded from arrest to fight systemic racism,
[50:38.240 --> 50:41.120]  close quote.
[50:41.120 --> 50:45.280]  Not only did they shield him from arrest in the name of fighting racism, they didn't
[50:45.280 --> 50:51.080]  even force him to go to their worthless program.
[50:51.080 --> 50:55.600]  He was known at the school as the school shooter.
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.840]  School shooter Nicholas Cruz was protected from arrest by Broward County school district
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.520]  officials thanks to a controversial disciplinary program, close quote, designed to combat systemic
[51:06.520 --> 51:10.560]  racism, close quote, by limiting arrest of minority students.
[51:10.560 --> 51:19.120]  So his last name was Cruz, even though he was a white guy adopted, and so he couldn't
[51:19.120 --> 51:22.520]  get in trouble threatening to kill everybody on a routine basis, and the police had been
[51:22.520 --> 51:30.040]  called 22 times, and they'd go, oh no, it was only three times, or oh no, he wasn't in
[51:30.040 --> 51:31.240]  this program.
[51:31.240 --> 51:32.240]  Remember that?
[51:32.240 --> 51:36.880]  Well, it turns out he was in the program.
[51:36.880 --> 51:40.600]  Broward County school district officials lied repeatedly for months by claiming otherwise
[51:40.600 --> 51:44.240]  from WJCT television.
[51:44.240 --> 51:48.280]  Broward County district officials admitted Sunday, took two days for us to learn this,
[51:48.280 --> 51:53.000]  that the confessed Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School gunman was assigned to a controversial
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.200]  disciplinary program after the superintendent repeatedly claimed Nicholas Cruz had no connection.
[51:58.200 --> 52:03.200]  Remember the Project Veritas videos of the school officials in New Jersey saying, oh
[52:03.200 --> 52:07.120]  yeah, they rape girls, everything, we lie to them, it's no big deal, to the alternative
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.920]  punishment designed to limit on-campus arrest.
[52:11.920 --> 52:17.040]  Two sources with knowledge of Cruz's discipline records, though WLRN, he was referred to the
[52:17.040 --> 52:23.480]  so-called promise program for a three-day stint after committing vandalism at West Glades
[52:23.480 --> 52:28.160]  Middle School in 2013, and then it goes on and he was put back in it repeatedly.
[52:28.160 --> 52:32.240]  For all the different threats and vandalization and threatening to kill people, it goes on
[52:32.240 --> 52:38.080]  for page after page, all the news reports, everything.
[52:38.080 --> 52:42.040]  Here are some of the individual headlines, Sun Sentinel.
[52:42.040 --> 52:47.440]  What's the future of Broward County's promise program?
[52:47.440 --> 52:52.280]  After news, Nicholas Cruz was referred there, and it goes on to say, the news said it wasn't
[52:52.280 --> 52:58.080]  true, they were lying, Sun Sentinel, boom.
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.200]  Here's another one, Stoneman Douglas Shooter was assigned a controversial Broward discipline
[53:02.200 --> 53:07.000]  program that school officials admit.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Here's another one.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.520]  So, there's all the articles.
[53:12.520 --> 53:16.160]  Mark Rubio's chimed in saying that he was lied to about that by school officials.
[53:16.160 --> 53:20.440]  The whole boil down's on infowars.com, Dana Loeschers tweeted about it.
[53:20.440 --> 53:25.360]  The Broward School District repeatedly lied to parents, students, and us.
[53:25.360 --> 53:31.400]  When the NRA TV questioned them whether the Parkland murder was in the promise program,
[53:31.400 --> 53:39.080]  he was, the school and sheriff, Israel, the champion of this program, are liable, bingo.
[53:39.080 --> 53:40.080]  And they lied.
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.080]  Now, that ties into Google.
[53:41.080 --> 53:42.080]  This is just today.
[53:42.080 --> 53:48.440]  Bands, bail bonds ads from the entire platform, the Hill reports, saying bails, bondsmen are
[53:48.440 --> 53:54.320]  racist because a lot of the people they bail out are black or Hispanic.
[53:54.320 --> 53:58.520]  Just like if your last name's Cruz, you're threatening to kill everybody, you're reanalysing,
[53:58.520 --> 53:59.520]  sorry.
[53:59.520 --> 54:00.760]  You know, we can't ever stop you.
[54:00.760 --> 54:05.560]  We have to stand down, we have to stand down physically that day.
[54:05.560 --> 54:07.200]  This looks pretty premeditated, doesn't it?
[54:07.200 --> 54:08.280]  They didn't do the shooting.
[54:08.280 --> 54:09.560]  They didn't have crisis actors.
[54:09.560 --> 54:10.560]  We never said that.
[54:10.560 --> 54:12.440]  The media lied.
[54:12.440 --> 54:14.920]  We said they stood down with witnesses.
[54:14.920 --> 54:17.440]  Those are the videos YouTube took down.
[54:17.440 --> 54:22.480]  Those were the videos CNN said they wanted down and they misrepresented.
[54:22.480 --> 54:26.640]  People announced today it would no longer allow bail bonds companies to buy advertisements
[54:26.640 --> 54:28.360]  on its ad platforms.
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.480]  The company explained its decision was based on research showing that for profit bail bonds
[54:32.480 --> 54:38.080]  providers make most of the revenue from communities of color and low income neighborhoods, those
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.640]  color and low income neighborhoods, when they are at their most vulnerable, okay, we'll
[54:43.640 --> 54:44.880]  just stay in jail then.
[54:44.880 --> 54:46.520]  But again, it's this whole thing.
[54:46.520 --> 54:50.920]  Don't go after people that commit crimes unless they're white.
[54:50.920 --> 54:51.920]  And here it is.
[54:51.920 --> 54:52.920]  This is an experience.
[54:52.920 --> 54:59.680]  87-year-old woman raped for two hours by newly arrived Moroccan migrant.
[54:59.680 --> 55:04.560]  Sex between a 23-year-old migrant to 10-year-old girl is not rape, says Finland's High Court,
[55:04.560 --> 55:06.840]  says Muslims are allowed to rape your children.
[55:06.840 --> 55:08.360]  That's mainstream news.
[55:08.360 --> 55:15.280]  Sweden, 88% of gang rapists have migrant background.
[55:15.280 --> 55:21.200]  Police won't give description of rapists in Sweden to now get the law.
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.800]  Paris Mayor Bax Communist Party planned to turn public park into migrant camp.
[55:25.800 --> 55:30.080]  Swedish child raped by three men on her way home, police refused to give description
[55:30.080 --> 55:32.680]  of the perpetrators.
[55:32.680 --> 55:33.680]  Heard of this before?
[55:33.680 --> 55:37.640]  Bring in the foreign invaders and make them above the law.
[55:37.640 --> 55:45.680]  Gun-free Britain, four shootings in 48 hours in Sadiq, Collins, London, on and on and on.
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.280]  I've got other interesting news out of Europe.
[55:48.280 --> 55:51.400]  Old payer NHS, the girl has one leg shorter than the other.
[55:51.400 --> 55:52.680]  She wanted a surgery to fix it.
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.520]  They said, no, we'll just chop your leg off.
[55:54.520 --> 55:57.120]  Oh yeah, they got a lot of doctors in Cuba too.
[55:57.120 --> 55:59.360]  If you're blind, they don't give you a cornea surgery.
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.280]  If you have cataracts, they just give you a cane.
[56:03.280 --> 56:04.280]  Now that's happening there.
[56:04.280 --> 56:10.000]  But let me bring you this little schnibblet of information.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.120]  People think she's a Parkland crisis actor.
[56:12.120 --> 56:13.120]  It's terrifying.
[56:13.120 --> 56:22.760]  And then it says they learned from Alex Jones that Emma Jane Gonzalez was a crisis actor
[56:22.760 --> 56:26.520]  and was Emma Gonzalez, the shaved head anti-gun girl.
[56:26.520 --> 56:27.520]  And you read the article.
[56:27.520 --> 56:32.560]  It just says, Alex Jones says she's an actress, Alex Jones says that she's a crisis actor.
[56:32.560 --> 56:33.560]  That's where they did it.
[56:33.560 --> 56:34.560]  Never said it.
[56:34.560 --> 56:35.560]  Never saw this woman.
[56:35.560 --> 56:36.560]  None of my writers ever said it.
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.720]  They don't show where I said this in the Washington Post.
[56:40.720 --> 56:46.760]  This is how Jeff Bezos strikes back the guy that owns it, Amazon, yes, you know, I go
[56:46.760 --> 56:47.760]  protest Amazon.
[56:47.760 --> 56:50.240]  And so now this is what he does to me.
[56:50.240 --> 56:51.960]  I've never talked about this woman.
[56:51.960 --> 56:53.480]  I didn't say they were crisis actors.
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.480]  I didn't say this woman in another city who's 30-something years old was the real Emma Gonzalez
[56:58.480 --> 57:00.200]  who I'm not saying is a crisis actor.
[57:00.200 --> 57:01.200]  They don't care.
[57:01.200 --> 57:03.040]  They say, I'm brutalizing a woman.
[57:03.040 --> 57:04.040]  I'm a bad person.
[57:04.040 --> 57:05.840]  I'm evil.
[57:05.840 --> 57:06.840]  And they're never going to stop.
[57:06.840 --> 57:07.840]  That'll be the new thing.
[57:07.840 --> 57:10.480]  He said an innocent woman was Emma Gonzalez.
[57:10.480 --> 57:15.360]  That's the fraud of the mainstream media, Washington Post.
[57:15.360 --> 57:20.000]  I'm going to contact this woman and say, man, please come on the show and please show me
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.960]  where any of my people or any of us ever said you were a crisis actor because you could
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.480]  say that I questioned Sandy Hook and then later said, I guess it's official stories
[57:29.480 --> 57:30.480]  right.
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.360]  Then they just retread that and say, I'm still saying it didn't happen.
[57:32.360 --> 57:34.520]  But with this, I didn't say that ever.
[57:34.520 --> 57:39.120]  And it's a fraud on me and a way to then sit there and demonize info wars and probably
[57:39.120 --> 57:40.720]  gear up some new lawsuit.

[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.480]  to the violence of the sun.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:24.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.520]  Alright I want to quantify something right now then I'm going to get into huge breaking
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.000]  news on the Iran deal.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Trump saying he's pulling out of that.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.160]  The latest on one of the me too movement leaders reportedly calling women brown slaves and beating
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.920]  them savage leader in sex.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.320]  The Newark Attorney General that's all coming up and they got a small correction to make
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.800]  here in a moment as well.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.640]  I had read that Jared Custer still was in a foundation with the observer that's always
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.640]  attacking Trump.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.640]  It turns out a year ago he totally divested from it.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.840]  So thanks to the crew for pointing that out to me.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.560]  Well good I said I'm not against Custer and it didn't make sense.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]  So there you go.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.120]  The observer used to be more conservative.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.760]  It's just pure garbage.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.000]  Anyways I digress.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.200]  Let me explain what happened with Sandy Hook.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.000]  Dr. Steve Pachennick did run psychological operations for the State Department.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.080]  He ran major CIA operations.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.320]  He's on record in the New York Times overthrowing major governments.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.920]  He co-authored a bunch of books for Clancy.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.920]  He was one of his main sources.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.000]  He said the whole thing was staged from his sources and he says he had meetings with generals
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.800]  and he's used to be high level CFR and saying 9-11 was a stand down.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.320]  A lot of that came out later in 28 pages.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.720]  He said it was staged.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.480]  There were anomalies.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480]  I questioned it.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.160]  I have a right to do that.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.640]  I looked at both sides.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.760]  Paul Watson got really mad at me and we have the emails.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.600]  I've shown these on air.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.400]  Aaron Dykes a good reporter here at the time.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.440]  He thought it was a load of crap to say nobody died and that we couldn't say for sure so
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.320]  that I shouldn't even question it and I would have arguments about babies and incubators
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.560]  in Iraq and they lied about that to get us into war so I thought it was okay to question.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.440]  But once you saw the parents and all the stuff out there I started saying no you know they
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.040]  come off as real but I have one of the First Amendment right to doubt anything.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.120]  I can be a crazy person that doubts if the Empire State Building exists.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.920]  The media saw that about three and a half years ago as weakness and thought wait Jones
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.320]  is backtracked on Sandy Hook so they built their whole Democratic Party system on it.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.000]  Hillary ran ads against me with it.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  You name it.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.560]  Well all's fair in love and war.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.040]  They could halfway argue that I said some of that before so they can say that now even
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.600]  though I've said that I don't believe that now and I did believe it at the time and then
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:45.920]  I changed my mind and I had that right but what I will not put up with and what has really
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.680]  fed me up is CNN saying that I said nobody died at Parkland and that the four students
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:58.840]  they chose out of a 3,000 who were anti gunners were crisis actors.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.040]  I said they were chosen because they were in the drama department that was also anti
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.840]  gun and well spoken and they said that themselves in interviews that's why I said that so they
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.680]  conflated that I said there was a police stand down that's what they took down of my videos
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:19.320]  on YouTube and almost banned us but when we put the videos back up people got to see them
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.600]  for themselves and they got to watch it for themselves they said that had nothing to do
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.400]  with that and Jones didn't say that so even Bloomberg said it was done wrongly my stuff
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.240]  was put back up.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.360]  Well now the Washington Post owned by the guy that made $12 billion in one week two
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.880]  weeks ago Jeff Bezos richest man in the world runs an article saying people think she's
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.320]  a Parkland crisis actor it's terrifying and her name is Emma Jane Gonzalez and they'll
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.760]  probably have the you know the opposition or something edit this together and play it
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.760]  where I'm saying she is an actor or crisis actor I've never seen this woman we never
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.880]  said they were crisis actors we said it happened we said there was a stand down which is now
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:05.840]  proven and it just says in here in the article they learned about it from Alex Jones who's
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.760]  being sued for saying Sandy Hook didn't happen and it just says that they learned that this
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:15.280]  lays a crisis actor for me no they didn't they don't show where I said it there's no
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.000]  text it is a known lie to launch this whole new thing and because I'm decrying it they
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.160]  go oh look we got him on this keep doing it no you're discrediting yourselves this is
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:30.440]  the real Emma Gonzalez who's an anti-gun activist and now turned herself into a celebrity on
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.440]  this okay blaming gun owners for what happened this is the real girl that she was 17 years
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.600]  old not the 30-something-year-old Emma Jane Gonzalez who is not that woman so I'm not
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.440]  correcting this I'm correcting the Washington Post that knows full well its line I'm gonna
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:51.440]  tell you right now everybody's got a boycott Amazon they are out of control they are a
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:59.400]  cancer and Trump needs to break it up Bezos is a sweatshop owner I want to plow into all
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:05.560]  of this that I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:13.480]  that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:20.200]  from info or store.com you are funding the revolution I mean I cannot say it any clearer

[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.840]  in the room.

[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.680]  at the bottom of the hour we'll then have open phones today in the third hour on this
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:48.920]  live Tuesday the 8th day already of May 2018 again I am your host Alex Jones I got a bunch
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:55.520]  of clips I want to get to a bunch of US news a bunch of propaganda out of Hollywood news
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:05.920]  a bunch of police state news there's just so much but before I do that I want to hit
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:17.400]  two stories in particular and then go to these clips there's a story up on infowars.com
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:24.280]  louderwithcrowder.com that is so important because it links directly through to the London
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:39.280]  Telegraph and other publications so when you hear this this is really going on this is
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:51.200]  really happening single payer NHS recommends amputation instead of treatment for girls
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:58.640]  leg now all of us have experienced I think leftist in their fantasy land where their
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:05.080]  brain is up in cloud cuckoo world tell us we all deserve free healthcare like England
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:10.920]  it's the best in the world or Cuba's got more doctors per capita than anybody they're incredible
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.960]  and their education's free or man Canada's got great healthcare if you actually know
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.840]  people and you actually research you know that Canadians about half of them choose to come
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:31.000]  to the US for their healthcare you learn the NHS will give you for strep throat a package
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.480]  of Alka Seltzer and Tylenol to this eugenics based and tell you go home and get over it
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:45.480]  you have to get the NHS is then approval to be referred to a private doctor in a secondary
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:53.720]  healthcare scheme the NHS also heats its buildings with dead babies bodies if you're a new listener
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:09:01.040]  that sounds insane just look it up I'm not joking I remember when I was in high school
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.200]  I was a c-span junkie like a soap opera for me I was really into it the Waco hearings
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:14.520]  and came a few years after all that and I would watch Parliament Prime Minister's questions
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.560]  that aired several times a week live and then taped I remember watching even before Tony
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:29.080]  Blair but then Tony Blair as well later would sit up there and they would have Prime Minister's
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:34.920]  questions and every third or fourth question was this individual had an operable tumor
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:42.400]  if you operate within six months 95% success rate this but then waited 18 months and died
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.680]  and then this little boy Jimmy had a brain tumor or another tumor and if he would have
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.200]  had surgery he would have taken care of or this little girl had a congenital heart defect
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.520]  that was 100% operable but you have to get it in the first year because as they grow
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.720]  the hole in the heart gets bigger and causes death and she died and he would hop up from
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.640]  his chair because they asked the question you stand up when you're getting asked the
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.400]  question you sit down so you would stand up sit down stand up and sit down and say yes
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.560]  I agree we need more funding for NHS no one is saying this is okay we still have the
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.760]  vessels in the well but it's despicable that it's happening so I remember watching that
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:23.920]  and then going to college and then being in the media and always hearing the NHS in England
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:33.840]  is the gold standard of the planet over and over and over and over again and they tell
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.920]  them oh be proud of what we have we're the best and it's also eugenics based if they
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.440]  say you drink too much or you smoked ever sorry you don't get healthcare it goes on
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.840]  and on because once everything's pooled well we shouldn't paper smile they didn't live
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.840]  their life right even if that person paid even more taxes it doesn't matter everything's
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:58.320]  in the file everything's tracked so what did this little girl get denied she had one leg
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.480]  shorter than the other and there's a corrective surgery so she wouldn't have to wear a big
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:14.520]  boot for clubfoot basically and they told her we'll just chop your leg off in an official
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:21.440]  document and that's always the joke in in in Cuba where they do have more doctors than
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:26.520]  anybody per capita it's a joke you're getting cataracts get a cane your knee goes out get
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:34.520]  a cane the joke is get a cane single payer NHS recommends amputation instead of treatment
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:43.480]  for girls leg what you have gangrene too far gone no she have a tumor no so much for NHS
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:52.440]  being the envy of the world in our continuing coverage of the UK's healthcare system screwing
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:12:00.320]  over kids I give you this little gals tail was British lass has a deformity which makes
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.440]  one of her legs much shorter than the other yeah one of my legs is about an inch shorter
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:12.200]  and mine should be chopped off she went to the NHS to have them fix her they wanted to
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.640]  chop her leg off and that links to mainstream news that put it on screen and click on that
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:25.960]  for folks for TV viewers a schoolgirl with one leg shorter than the other has been told
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:34.000]  by the NHS her only option is amputation even though it's a $6,000 surgery in the US however
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.160]  a leading US surgeon claims UK doctors have the training but not the confidence to save
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.600]  her limb by lengthening it and that the NHS lacks the highly specialist rehabilitation
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.680]  services she needs after surgery Dr. Drawer Paley has told the parents of seven year old
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:58.480]  Kyra Warren who was born with a rare condition affecting her thigh bone that her treatment
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:04.360]  is straightforward yeah they just go in and add a graft a bone either from a cadaver or
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:10.160]  they put in synthetic she wouldn't even have to limp once her leg lengthening surgeries
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:20.520]  are complete seems it's getting harder every day to get a leg up in the UK so again that's
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.840]  the one telegraph daily mail you name it and we're showing video let's show video this
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.160]  little girl that just needs three or four inches added to her leg they go into her thigh
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:35.880]  bone they'd add a synthetic bone they can even laboratory grow bones now or they could
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:42.760]  add a cadaver bone she needs four inches but no we'll just chop your leg off because as
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.560]  we get better science better technology we get less for the people Paul Joseph Watson's
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.040]  upper middle class he's not rich but you know he's paid well he deserves it 16 years you
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:00.640]  know loyal fighter in the info war and again three years ago he had strep throat coughing
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.280]  up blood for three weeks he was off air for two weeks couldn't hardly talk and he said
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:10.560]  I've been to the NHS six times he's talked about it on air and he said they keep giving
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:16.080]  me these little packages of alcohol seltzers and Tylenol and he goes Alex I'm getting scared
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.440]  they won't refer me I think they're discriminating against me to a private position they would
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:26.360]  not give him antibiotics they would not they would not do it anybody's ever had strep throat

[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:42.080]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host when i say that we've gotten over 300 tv affiliates
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:50.720]  and over 70 cable affiliates we already had 20 cable systems or so and maybe 15 tv stations
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.880]  we got a particular type of satellite that was the newest and the fanciest was not what
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.080]  people wanted and i never really promoted it because i was always trying to build a
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.600]  new studios and you know go 20 24 hours a day before i promoted it but then a year turned
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:09.080]  into two years so we went to a lot of these big conventions in chicago and vegas in new
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:16.040]  york in los angeles and we got the satellites everybody wanted and we also said the key
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:25.920]  word free to air we're on an hour each hour got 15 minutes ads those 15 minutes ads are
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.640]  100 percent belong to local stations they like that we do a couple minutes of plugging
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:38.040]  each hour for ourselves and they love it i want to do it with radio or our local affiliates
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:43.000]  get them all but i'm still partnered with gcn i can leave gcn but i'm a very little person
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.160]  i like ted anderson and 90 percent of gcn's revenue is me i'll tell you that it's actually
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.560]  97 percent i think they rely on me a little too much but i'd like to go free to air on
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:00.720]  radio that'd be so revolutionary for a for-profit show to get the local stations all the ads
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.840]  because my mission is to get the message out that said i got a big job ahead of me i said
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:15.160]  every week i'm going to profile a cable system that we're on and a radio network radio station
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:20.280]  here's the one i shot a few days ago on friday and they produced it and i got to cut a new
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:29.120]  one this week for a cable system that covers seven counties in florida and i've got ones
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.800]  in california i don't even want to say some of the ones are so big but they want to be
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.400]  promoted i know they'll get a few phone calls a few harassments by the establishment but
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.280]  they understand what they're signing on to they understand we're under attack they understand
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.640]  we're telling the truth they're listeners there's so many station owners and station
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:50.840]  managers and cable station owners picking us up now it's exciting we're in talks today
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.640]  with a gentleman that owns 200 tv stations and it looks like they're going to pick us
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:01.840]  up and we're talking 24 hours a day even though we're 10 hours live at loops because they've
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.960]  got these sub channels but those are popular and then we run promos on their main channels
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:15.160]  now i cut a one-minute promo they run on their channel on channel nine in houston that reaches
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:21.160]  over three million homes on the main cable system and they got other tv stations and
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.320]  the fellow that lee cook invented internet over phone lines phonoscope he has the patents
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.240]  50 something years ago 60 years ago in fact he basically was like a consultant on 2001
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:34.680]  space odyssey when you see you know where he's there talking to his daughter from from
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:41.480]  the from the from the moon base from the from the space station and they've had us on for
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.720]  a few years so i thought they'd be the one they've got ron paul on every day as well
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.280]  they'd be the one for us to promo first but this is a job i'm not complaining because
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:56.360]  you're going to start seeing every week a new promo for tv and radio stations and radio
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:03.680]  networks that we're on and so here it is in houston phonoscope and this is a promo running
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:11.360]  on phonoscope that runs on cnn and all the channels on basic cable because they're they're
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:16.000]  that's how the cable rules work so this ad and another one-minute ad and another 24 second
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.240]  ad are airing all over the cable in houston and the listorship is just exploding want to report
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.400]  that to george soros every time we go under attack god just opens another door so thanks
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.840]  for your prayers folks thanks for your support reaching a lot more people so here's that
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:37.520]  phonoscope promo every week we're going to be profiling a different tv station tv network
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.760]  or cable station or network that's picking up in full wars we're on well over 100 stations
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.360]  right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago now one tv station
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.840]  has actually been picking this up for several years and i want to profile first is phonoscope
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:25:01.680]  phonoscopes creator and owner is the man that invented more than 50 60 years ago streaming
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.280]  television over phone lines that's why it's called phonoscope and why it's patented well
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.880]  he's got several channels and stations in houston and he's got us on 24 hours a day
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:21.280]  on phonoscope channel nine in houston cable systems so we're talking a potential of six
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.400]  million people that are able to tune in this is very very exciting so to all of our listeners
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:33.360]  online even if you're not in houston be sure and tell any friends family or neighbors or folks
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.800]  that you know who live in the houston area they can tune in to cable channel nine to phonoscope
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.960]  not just for my four hour broadcast every day from our state of the art tv and radio studios
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:48.720]  here in austin but to insure your david night and all the other shows and all the other news
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:55.120]  and anchors analysis that we're at it so phonoscope is our oldest tv affiliate they've been picking
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  this up i guess for four years now and so we really appreciate them they're also one of our
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.320]  biggest massive response so to lee cook and the entire family down there in phonoscope we salute
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.120]  you and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.240]  phonoscope and also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:20.560]  put out like ron paul's tv show so again for myself the entire info wars crew in austin texas
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.920]  we salute phonoscope in houston thanks for all you're doing for this republic you've helped make
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:33.760]  america great again if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance i don't know
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:40.400]  why i shouldn't have promo over 100 tv stations it's over 300 over 70 cable systems and that was
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:47.280]  as of about a week ago we just found a couple smaller deals other 15 stations or so a few
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:55.440]  more radio stations came in but we're i think we're gonna deal with 200 200 more and a lot of
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:02.240]  these are in big cities and are the main channels where they're doing stuff like carrying my show
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.760]  but taped to air at night during the family hour and then they tell people and tune over to our
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:15.280]  sub channel for 24 hours a day it's very smart now again in the late 70s they said that am
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.600]  stations were going to turn off but then conservatives and libertarians and people like
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:30.480]  the great patriot who helped us get rid of the fairness doctrine had the ideas to
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.840]  hey launch political talk radio on there and get around the leftist control that dominated
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.440]  television so the internet of the 80s and 90s before we really had the modern internet was
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:48.480]  am radio and it's still there today it's still doing pretty good despite all the attacks because
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.840]  people decided to use it well they say tv local cable local broadcast tv doesn't have the listeners
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.800]  that used to have the viewers it's not true you put specialty things on local sports local news
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.440]  that has huge ratings you put special political programming on that's pro america that people
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.880]  are hungry for why do you think sinclair has had all this pro trump stuff on because it's popular
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:14.880]  it sells and it's good so again ladies and gentlemen sinclair knows what they're doing
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:25.120]  they're the leader nationwide in local television and we're not on sinclair at this point but i'm
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.960]  saying they know what to do so these tv stations these cable systems are putting us on all over
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:37.360]  it is explosive this is very very exciting so thank you all for spreading the word to your

[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:02.080]  we're doing against the globalists now joining us is f william engdahl he is an award-winning
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.880]  geopolitical analyst strategic risk consultant author professor in lecture he specialized for
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.520]  more than 30 years in geopolitical analysis of global events and special focus on the interactions
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.200]  of economics with politics william engdahl dot com is the website the new book is manifest destiny
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:24.480]  i'll talk some about uh that with him as well but first thank you for coming on sir good to be
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.920]  with you again Alex it's been a long time uh geopolitically before we get into the details
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:36.320]  the 35 000 view foot view where is the world right now how do you see trump how do you see
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.720]  putin in this bipolar world uh or do you see it as a bipolar world what is the state of the
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:50.640]  planet right now if we look back say 50 years from now to the history books right now in my view we're
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:57.520]  at a uh no friend of al gore but we're at a critical tipping point geopolitically
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.120]  that depending on what happens i would say in the next 12 months we'll either determine
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:15.200]  if we have a chance at defanging this this globalist monster that as you mentioned and
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:23.520]  creating more freedom in the world for building up and what we have is a it's not really a deep
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:30.800]  state it's it's the powers that be behind the deep state the when he was alive david rockefeller was
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:38.160]  said to be the chairman of the board of this powers that be but the families that don't appear in
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:43.520]  the public the deep state are simply their uh house servants their bureaucrats and so forth
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:52.000]  uh nasty as they are and ambitious as they are but right now you have a counterpull and you've
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.720]  had it building since all of the provocations i would say going back to september 2001 with the
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:06.880]  war on terror the occupation of afghanistan the occupation of iraq and so forth uh supposedly
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:17.120]  going after osama bin laden which which was a a faint as you know and what we have is the emergence
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:27.360]  of an attempted counterpull or or counterweight to this sole superpower that papa bush declared
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:36.720]  in uh 1990 uh after the collapse of the soviet union and then counter part or the counter power
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:47.440]  is the growing alliance between russia china and interestingly enough iraq so if you go to the
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:56.320]  defense policy strategy document that was just released about six weeks ago in washington
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.960]  and they defined the greatest potential threat facing the united states military in the world
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:11.440]  today is russia and china now general of hotel the head of the sitcom recently added iran to
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:17.280]  that calculus and you see if you look at a map and look at the trade agreements look at the
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:25.920]  energy deals that are going on between these the agreements to trade oil not in the dollars
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:34.400]  but in their own currencies building pipelines exchanging formidable russian anti aircraft
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:41.040]  defense systems and so forth you begin to see that the shanghai cooperation organization countries
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:46.880]  and the potential of iran to become a member of that under under the maintaining of this
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:52.720]  nuclear agreement that trump seems to be about to cancel from the u.s. side that that creates a
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:40:01.120]  counterpull and everything that we have seen coming out of washington uh with trump's acquiescence
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:08.400]  or without it i think he's uh well let me say something uh controversial i think he's a secondary
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:16.880]  part of this i don't think any president since kennedy was assassinated in 1962 has uh set his
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:28.560]  own agenda uh the deep state the powers that be decide what the agenda is and if a president
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:34.880]  tries to buck that as as many presidents have tried on the edges uh if it's serious enough they're
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.840]  dealt with so i think that's what we're seeing recently with with trump but the
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:50.160]  uh the appointments john bolton national security advisor uh nicky holly at the united nations
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:41:01.520]  pompio as secretary of state the torture lady as head of cia potentially uh you see
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:10.560]  that the policy establishment is bringing the u.s. into uh the next phase which i think will be to
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.480]  not be around out how are they going to do that i don't think it's going to be through a war uh
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:23.280]  this dog and pony show that benjamin net and yahoo presented to the world about 10 or 12 days
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.560]  ago with all these graphs and these colorful cartoons and very melodramatic presentation
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.240]  there there wasn't a shred of the verifiable evidence presented in there just some photos of
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:40.800]  uh what well it was just old old admitted stuff that wasn't denied before but then but
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.120]  then projected into this future and you know i agree with you that well let me ask this question
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.440]  why do you think the power structure has been so angry at trump because he signaled he wanted
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.240]  to work with russia he signaled he didn't want the u.s. to be a hegemonic power he signaled he
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.680]  didn't want us bankrolling it uh he didn't want to rule through subterfuge i mean just his rhetoric
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.240]  is what sent them into such hysteria because you know now now he is signaling with these new
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.560]  appointments that he's now getting back in line uh with the anglo-american imperium well
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:19.120]  we may never know the exact answer to that alex it uh it can be that a part of the circle around
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:27.600]  him uh generally is is trying to de-escalate this this lunatic attack on on russia with the uh
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.040]  with the sanctions with the blaming for the screep all poisoning in london something that
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.680]  that's important stay there f william engdahl best-selling author researcher geopolitical

[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.440]  all right he's one of the most respected geopolitical analysts out there in europe the
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.800]  united states he's f william engdahl he's been all over international television
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.400]  he's written a whole bunch of best-selling books i've read several of them and he's joining us to
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:43.120]  get into the power structure and why the globalist hate russia so much because i've never been to russia
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:51.120]  but i know russia has been under basically neoliberal globalist uh proto-globalist control
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:57.520]  the whole bolster revolution was financed uh by the british crown by us robber barron interest
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:03.040]  um perhaps as a historian he can break that down for you and then they've lost control of it and
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:06.720]  now they're becoming christian they're becoming free market they've got more resources than we've
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.880]  got we should be working with russia and under general flin and more pragmatic views i know at
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.360]  the pentagon we look at the threat of radical islam we look at demographic issues we look at
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:26.000]  the need for resources the united states europe and russia should be unified for global peace
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.800]  and economic prosperity spatial exploration they're no longer the evil soviet union but
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.600]  we're dealing with the very same interest from my view that actually created the soviet union
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.480]  and then worked through it to create a fake polar world to consolidate control now it looks like a
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:46.080]  real uh two polar world is materializing but maybe you're really the expert on this and you
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:51.200]  tie it into the eugenics all of it who's hijacked the west because we're not taking over russia for
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.320]  the average american so we should probably define who the anglo-americans establishment is and then
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:03.760]  why they hate russia uh so much sir please break it down uh i would go and i go into this in great
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:11.440]  detail in in the manifest destiny democracies cognitive disorder the new book the rape of
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:20.080]  russia as i call it in the book took place in a coup d'etat against well the soviet union was
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:25.760]  rotten and was collapsing anyway and gorbachev was ready to raise the white flag of surrender
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:36.000]  but the in 1991 the cia and this i document in great detail in the book the cia guided by
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:46.320]  the networks of george wassenior worked to bring boris yeltsin into power and his family the mafia
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:54.800]  around yeltsin they created the oligarchs michel kodakowski uh barajowski uh of you name them
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:04.880]  abramowitz and these multi-billionaire oligarchs were created by the anglo-american establishment
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:13.600]  under let's make it very simple the city of london and wall street banks without those banks
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:19.360]  the billions and billions of dollars of the russian oligarchs could never have been laundered
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:26.240]  out of russia into the assets that they bought all around the world so russian organized prime is
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:33.760]  really a spin-off of what was then cia organized prime they used banks in switzerland tied to rigsbank
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:41.440]  the brother of president bush senior jonathan bush was up to his eyeballs in this whole and
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.400]  that goes back to the os s in world war two and the sicilian networks and all of this is all main
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:51.600]  line history because the average person doesn't know that the globalists the proto-globalists the
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:58.480]  anglo-americans went and colonized russia put the soviets in made them live in slave conditions
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:03.520]  fence all their products and raw material out use them to launch invasions of countries
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.480]  that western nations wouldn't accept i mean this is truly full spectrum diabolic behavior
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:15.680]  yeah well what happened in 1999 after 10 years of no pensions were being paid to russians
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:20.960]  suddenly there was mass unemployment alcoholism was a reaction of many
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:27.440]  unemployed russians to this hopeless situation receiving hopeless and a faction a nationalist
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:37.440]  faction of the intelligence community in russia backed an unknown young man by the name of
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:44.400]  latimer putin and put him managed to get him in as prime minister and then putin and the
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:52.000]  nationalist made an offer that yeltsin couldn't refuse we let you leave office with your billions
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.880]  get the hell out of politics and we'll leave you alone but we're taking over and that is why
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:06.560]  the neocons the people around uh president trump today loathe and despise russia with every fiber
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:12.800]  of their being that's why victoria newland the assistant secretary of state for europe and eastern
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:22.320]  europe despises putin and and so forth because he drew the line in the sand in 1999 and in 2000
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:28.880]  when he became prime minister president for the first time in the elections and said no russia
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.880]  will not be destroyed as a functioning nation we will rebuild it somehow so all of the sanctions
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.000]  that are targeting the people around putin all of the lives that are coming the fake media out of
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:51.920]  the us cnn uh you name it bbc this is all intended to demonize uh putin for trying to not declare
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.800]  war on the west but trying to preserve the the nation of russia now let me bring this in because
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:01.600]  everything f william indole is saying is mainline historical truth but the public is ignorant of it
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.560]  and his books break it down but this is what's insane the very same globalist forces praying on
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:11.920]  america are the same ones trying to get control of russia and if you look at a lot of patriots in
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:16.880]  our government the citizens help get trump elected in the hope of repeating that so if there is russian
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:22.800]  collusion it's that in europe and in brazil and all over people know that russia's gotten out from
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:29.920]  under this global scourge and so russia has led the way from the bottom out of this towards
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:35.360]  nationalism i think that's why they're so upset at russia because they see it as kind of patient
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:43.120]  zero of the globalist domino system collapsing yeah i think that's a good summary of it the uh
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:50.800]  they get into a white rage when they they think of russia intervening at the invitation of the
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:59.120]  bashar al-sad government in syria in september 2015 to prevent isis which has a large component
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:07.760]  thousands of chech and terrorists are fighting in in syria to topple bashar al-sad there's a long
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:16.480]  term deep state agenda for syria which we're seeing the neocons and the people around them
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:25.120]  implement right now and that is not to leave syria but to break up syria into many warring
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:37.840]  uh principalities uh syria suni alawit christian and so forth and curds and play one off against
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:46.720]  the other and then manipulate the whole pipeline strategy of that and also lead that into the
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:52.560]  destabilization of iran not through war i don't think i think what's gonna happen if i as i suspect
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:58.640]  in a few minutes president trump will announce the not signing off on the nuclear agreement
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:06.080]  is that uh they'll put in snap sanctions minuchin the former goldman sachs guy who's running all these
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.880]  treasury wars around the world uh talked about snap sanctions that will come right back in
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.880]  against iran prohibiting them from selling their oil uh look at what they did against musal the
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:26.320]  second largest dilunam company in the world uh with the sanctions a few weeks ago and those
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.920]  sanctions are going to create the background for a color revolution attempt again in iran
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.240]  through uh popular discontent on the economy and there are real problems in the iran economy no
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:45.920]  question so this this is the agenda russia iran china with the trade war but that's only the
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:53.280]  beginning in china and divide and rule it's it's the globalist agenda and i think the united states
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:00.320]  you know i we should get out of these wars we should rebuild america make america great again
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.120]  as as trump talked about in the election campaign well that's the thing is that is it's paradoxical
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.120]  trump's done a lot of good things the globalist are mad at him but now he's sliding into what they
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.680]  want we're not saying iran's run by good guys either it's just part of this larger seven nation
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:19.120]  takedown that leslie clark talked about there's got to be a what a third way out of this and i know
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.600]  russia's tried to work with us they've tried to fight radical islam they've really been putting
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.920]  up with their troops getting killed they've really been over backwards and i'm not a rusa file it's
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:36.640]  just a fact yeah it can't be disputed it's it's on on record and they've had conference after
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:42.720]  conference to try to get the united states involved in that every time there's been duplicity on the
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:48.960]  on the side of washington uh i think the situation with trump as a person is that
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:56.640]  somebody has the blackmail dossier on donald trump and every time he tries to do something
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:04.640]  halfway positive he gets slammed so i would concentrate less on the person of donald trump
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:10.160]  and more on the overall actions i agree i agree we've got to go to break the presence about five
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:13.360]  minutes out but stay with us for five more minutes before the president comes on he's
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.280]  about five minutes late president trump gives remarks coming up next we're going to be
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.200]  showing that but f william engdahl come to a few more minutes with us on your book come back for
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.360]  a full hour i've read your new book i've read two of your books along on gmo and i went on the
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:30.000]  anglo-american establishment read them years ago i forget the names but uh well i want to read the
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.720]  new one because what you say is so on target just from the globalist own writings of what they admit
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.640]  you just give your perspective which i think is dead on so i'll talk about how do we exactly
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:44.480]  focus on populism nationalism versus globalism and not pin everything on trump i think that'd be a
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:52.160]  mistake we'll be back alex jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a

[01:59:53.280 --> 02:00:22.880]  he's going through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:31.520]  oh and as i said the president usually speaks six seven eight minutes late to make sure everybody
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:36.960]  tunes in so next segment we'll be carrying the president's unfortunate remarks on iran i'm not
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:42.560]  a fan of iran i don't like the obama deal it was a scam bunch of payments back but this definitely
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:48.160]  wheels us towards war uh and you know we had bb telling us about the wmd's and iraq that were a
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:54.000]  sure thing uh i understand that saudi arabia you know is behind isis and al qaeda but then
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.880]  they're the new york city is is shooing iran saying they did 9 11 that's preposterous so
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.400]  this is just reality here f william engdahl big picture here nationalism rising globalism's in
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:10.640]  trouble uh how would you describe this fight what we should do to really expose it and
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.680]  what you think the tricks are they have up their sleeves to try to keep this world corporate
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.680]  government going well one of the major tricks they've developed since the reagan era is is the
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.880]  color revolutions that i talk about in the manifest destiny book uh these things have
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:33.280]  become so refined they have techniques called swarming where they have hit and run street
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:39.280]  protests like they did recently in yerevan and across our media to topple the government in
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:45.840]  that country and bring in someone who's more friendly to the united states although he claims to be
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:53.360]  still wanting to keep the economic union with russia so this is one of the things that we
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:58.400]  are seeing and that has not been rolled rolled back at all since the trump presidency began
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:05.280]  despite his comments to that effect i think we're going to see economic sanctions financial
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:10.080]  sanctions financial warfare because these sanctions are a form of warfare they're
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:15.680]  they're irregular warfare but they're every bit as deadly they're siege they're they're forms of
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:24.720]  blockades yeah yeah diabolical forms very precise targeting individual uh key industrialists in
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:31.520]  key countries or the oil sales of iran so it's about crippling your adversaries it's the old
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:40.080]  wulfowitz plan from 1992 when dick cheney was secretary of defense no rival country or nation
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:46.720]  or group of countries will be allowed to challenge american hegemony and that smacks to my mind of
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.640]  the periods of something that america never uh well beyond that and of course you're right
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:57.680]  the globalists make us pay for it they hate america too they're targeting flyover country
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:03.360]  christians they're trying to enslave us here as well this is not america doing this this is america
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:10.240]  basically hijacked like a slave to carry out this crime that's why i always refer to washington
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:15.040]  and not the united states because it's not most americans uh most of my friends are
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:22.800]  and let's say uh read alternative media are have not a clue they they can't believe
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.480]  something different from the washington polls so you know if that's all you're exposed to
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.760]  when you're trying to work hold down two jobs just to keep your family fed in the roof over your
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:42.400]  head you don't have time to do a lot of this uh thinking and uh so so it's it's difficult but
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.920]  the we're the human guinea pigs the american people are the human guinea pigs of this uh
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:57.200]  uh i would call it global fascist elite i use that term very very carefully and very economically
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:03.680]  precise but they want top-down total control they're totalitarians they're not democrats
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:09.120]  in any way shape or form no matter how much they yell at russia for being undemocratic
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.520]  they're the least right there's a world the totalitarian corporate state playing countries off
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:19.040]  against each other uh and it's it's it's it's really terrible f william engdahl william engdahl

[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:28.240]  a bunch and sell them and then four more store dot com thank you sir thank you that was a powerful
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:32.000]  interview and it's spot on ladies and gentlemen doesn't mean iran's perfect doesn't mean i don't
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  like the deal it means trump is being pushed into what he was against before and again our own
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.040]  government's pushing radical islam against russia so it's the same globalist i want europe open to
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:48.400]  islam that is another big keystone to all this is flooding us with islamist and putin has said no
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.800]  to that that's another reason george soros hates it remember lord soros is a major general in all
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:59.120]  this we'll be back on the other side with the president former secretary of state john carrey
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:03.760]  has been having secret meetings with foreign officials to keep the u.s in the iran nuclear
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:09.040]  deal and president trump is not having it carrey was one of the key architects of the iran deal
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:14.960]  which was signed in 2015 and the boston globe reported last week that he'd been quietly meeting
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:20.960]  with iranian and eu officials in recent months to strategize how to save his legacy trump tweeted
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:26.400]  the united states does not need john carrey's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:31.200]  badly negotiated iran deal he was the one that created this mess in the first place
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:35.760]  president trump has repeatedly criticized the iran deal calling it one of the worst and most
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:41.600]  one-sided transactions the u.s has ever entered into back in february of 2017
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:46.640]  president trump tweeted iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the u.s came
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:53.920]  along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the iran deal 150 billion dollars lienne macadoo info wars

[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:27.280]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:41.200]  a new world order well we are waiting you can hear the room noise there for the president
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:44.640]  to give his announcement on iran which we think will be pulling out of the deal
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.960]  probably setting a timetable for new talks and then that they don't come to the table there'll be a
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:58.560]  continuation of the sanctions that were previously there now the sanctions brought north korea to
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:02.960]  the table in a good way and we got that big piece still coming up maybe trump's writing what he's
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:09.600]  doing but remember the globalist have been caught behind the scenes uh under several
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:14.720]  administrations propping up the moolas who are very unpopular so i'm certainly not fans of them
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:23.520]  but the syria situation in other news up on news wars dot com and info wars dot com remember it's
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.640]  an ongoing info war and when you email to your neighbors your friends your family the stories
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:34.400]  every day when you hand print them out and leave at the dental office or the barber at church when
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:41.360]  you tell people about the show that bypasses the ai the sensors everything they're doing when you
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:46.640]  tell people about the local radio station you're listening to it's so important when you tell people
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:53.600]  about the local tv station or watching your cable station it's so critical like channel nine in

[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:53.760]  bulls it's worth noting that sniderman refused to investigate the brothman sisters running

[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:06.560]  let me know as soon as he says thank you it's worth noting that sniderman refused to
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:12.080]  investigate the brothman sisters running nexium out of albany until public pressure compelled
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:19.840]  him to do so just last march following the arrest of the founder keith rainier not even the seagrams
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:24.160]  not even the brothman's had enough power to stop this guy and actress allison mac

[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:40.080]  and a piece co-written by journalist roan ferro who first exposed winesteam last october
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:50.720]  and then it just goes on with what supposedly happened there well it certainly fits in
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:12:03.360]  to the whole thing and here's trump trump on eric in 2013 tweet wait and see worse than spitzer

[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:37.360]  described sniderman as a superhero who would stop trump the so-called sexual abuser what did
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.800]  governor qualmo know about his attorney general asked the daily caller quite a bit
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:51.680]  so we're about to find out what's happening on the whole i ran deal with the president
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:58.400]  here in just a moment before we go any further we hear the clapping that means the president
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.360]  is coming to the podium here here he is here we go see what's about to happen on our end
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:12.800]  my fellow americans today i want to update the world on our efforts to prevent iran
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:21.360]  from acquiring a nuclear weapon the iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:29.520]  it exports dangerous missiles fuels conflicts across the middle east and supports terrorist
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:40.080]  proxies and militias such as hezbollah hamas the taliban and al qaeda over the years iran
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:48.320]  and its proxies have bombed american embassies and military installations murdered hundreds of
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:57.600]  american service members and kidnapped imprisoned and tortured american citizens the iranian regime
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:04.560]  has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:12.160]  no action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:21.440]  and the means of delivering them in 2015 the previous administration joined with other nations
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:29.280]  in a deal regarding iran's nuclear program this agreement was known as the joint comprehensive
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:38.000]  plan of action or jc poa in theory the so-called iran deal was supposed to protect the united
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.880]  states and our allies from the lunacy of an iranian nuclear bomb a weapon that will only
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:54.320]  endanger the survival of the iranian regime in fact the deal allowed iran to continue

[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:18.880]  all right folks we are back live i am your host alex jones
[02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:25.920]  austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones that's right let's go back to the president
[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:31.040]  where we pause it during his speech we're taking it down live off our satellite feed
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:36.720]  now i've punched it up on fox news let's go ahead and roll him uh getting into what he plans to do
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:43.760]  pulling out of the iran deal that will only endanger the survival of the iranian regime
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:53.200]  in fact the deal allowed iran to continue enriching uranium and over time reach the
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:21:03.360]  brink of a nuclear breakout the deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on iran it exchanged
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:11.120]  for very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity and no limits at all on its other
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:19.680]  malign behavior including its sinister activities in syria yemen and other places all around the
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:29.280]  world in other words at the point when the united states had maximum leverage this disastrous deal
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:38.240]  gave this regime and it's a regime of great terror many billions of dollars some of it
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:46.960]  it in actual cash a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the united states
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:56.160]  a constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time but it wasn't at the heart of the
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:04.480]  iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:13.760]  program today we have definitive proof that this iranian promise was a lie last week israel
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:21.920]  published intelligence documents long concealed by iran conclusively showing the iranians regime
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:30.160]  and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons the fact is this was a horrible one-sided deal
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:38.480]  that should have never ever been made it didn't bring calm it didn't bring peace and it never
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:45.520]  will in the year since the deal was reached iran's military budget has grown by almost 40
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:53.200]  percent while its economy is doing very badly after the sanctions were lifted the dictatorship
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:23:02.160]  used its new funds to build nuclear-capable missiles support terrorism and cause havoc
[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:06.480]  throughout the middle east that is the big one they are delivering long-range icbm was so poorly
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:14.160]  negotiated that's true that even if iran fully complies the regime can still be on the verge
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:20.320]  of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time that's where they've got all the components
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:27.840]  the deal sunset provisions are totally unacceptable if i allowed this deal to stand there would soon
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:35.520]  be a nuclear arms race in the middle east everyone would want their weapons ready by the time that's
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:41.360]  a good point because it saw arabia wants to make it matters worse the deal's inspection provisions
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:52.320]  lack adequate mechanisms to prevent detect and punish cheating and don't even have the unqualified
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:24:01.360]  right to inspect many important locations including military facilities not only does the deal fail
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:07.760]  to halt iran's nuclear ambitions but it also fails to address the regime's development
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:17.280]  of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads finally the deal does nothing to constrain
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:26.480]  iran's destabilizing activities including its support for terrorism since the agreement iran's
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:35.600]  bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen in light of these laring flaws i announced last
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:43.760]  October that the iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated three months later on
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:52.560]  january 12th i repeated these conditions i made clear that if the deal could not be fixed the
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:59.680]  united states would no longer be a party to the agreement over the past few months we have engaged
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:07.040]  extensively with our allies and partners around the world including france germany and the united
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:15.680]  kingdom we have also consulted with our friends from across the middle east we are unified in our
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:23.760]  understanding of the threat and in our conviction that iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:32.640]  a nuclear weapon after these consultations it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an iranian
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:42.240]  nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement the iran deal
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:52.240]  is defective at its core if we do nothing we know exactly what will happen in just a short
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:59.280]  period of time the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:07.520]  world's most dangerous weapons therefore i am announcing today that the united states
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:17.040]  will withdraw from the iran nuclear deal in a few moments i will sign a presidential memorandum
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:26.880]  to begin reinstating us nuclear sanctions on the iranian regime we will be instituting the highest
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:34.320]  level of economic sanction any nation that helps iran in its quest for nuclear weapons
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:42.080]  could also be strongly sanctioned by the united states america will not be held hostage to nuclear
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:50.480]  blackmail we will not allow american cities to be threatened with destruction and we will not
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:58.000]  allow a regime the chance death to america to gain access to the most deadly weapons on earth
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:07.120]  today's action sends a critical message the united states no longer makes empty threats
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:17.040]  when i make promises i keep them in fact at this very moment secretary pompeo is on his way to
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:25.200]  north korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with kim jung one plans are being made
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:34.000]  relationships are building hopefully a deal will happen and with the help of china south korea
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:40.160]  and japan a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:49.360]  as we exit the iran deal we will be working with our allies to find a real comprehensive
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:58.800]  and lasting solution to the iranian nuclear threat this will include efforts to eliminate the threat
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:07.040]  of iran's ballistic missile program to stop its terrorist activities worldwide and to block its
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:14.640]  menacing activity across the middle east in the meantime powerful sanctions will go into
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:23.120]  full effect if the regime continues its nuclear aspirations it will have bigger problems than
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.720]  it has ever had before let's talk about their final we're going to come back with the final summation
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:34.800]  of the of the president's speech that we're in near time live but we're going to break here
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:39.920]  we started out live but we are now obviously rearing what he's already said but this was
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:43.920]  pretty predictable but let's talk about what's accurate and what he said and what is an actor
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:54.080]  from my perspective we'll talk about that too on the other side stay with us info wars dot com

[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:28.320]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones well i can tell you a lot of what
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:36.160]  president trump has said is absolutely true some of what he said is in the eye of the beholder i'm
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:41.040]  not going to say he's wrong and i don't just agree with the president to agree with him if he says
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:48.400]  stuff i don't agree with i'll i'll say it a lot of its perspective but i can see what he's doing
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:54.080]  here uh he's saying if you don't come to the table right now the sanctions are coming that's a good
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:58.080]  thing i thought they might announce them today which would really escalate things so he's really
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:03.360]  trying to get him to the table i'm going to break down from deep research what's really going on as
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:08.640]  soon as we finish the president's statement that he just concluded uh so let's go back to the time
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:15.120]  machine from four minutes ago and go back to the president nuclear aspirations it will have bigger
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:23.520]  problems than it has ever had before finally i want to deliver a message to the long-suffering
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:30.960]  people of iran the people of america stand with you it has now been almost 40 years since this
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:40.000]  dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage most of iran's 80 million citizens have
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:47.600]  sadly never known an iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:57.200]  of the world but the future of iran belongs to its people they are the rightful heirs to a rich
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:06.240]  culture and an ancient land and they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams honor
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:15.440]  to their history and glory to god iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:23.360]  a new deal they refuse and that's fine i'd probably say the same thing if i was in their position
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:32.400]  but the fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal one that benefits all of iran
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:42.240]  and the iranian people when they do i am ready willing and able great things can happen for iran
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:50.640]  and great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the middle east
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:36:00.400]  there has been enough suffering death and destruction let it end now thank you god bless
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:23.040]  you thank you and then now he's going to sign exiting okay i've got seven notes here i want to go over
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:28.960]  now the president just concluded that and i'm going to say this i'm going to give the president
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:35.600]  the benefit of the doubt because he's gotten north korea to the table i do think the dictatorship
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:42.240]  by the mulas is a bad thing it's true that more than half their population is below the age of 25
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:48.640]  it's true that in international polls of iranians they don't like the mulas it's true that lindesor
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.120]  sewers funded by saudi arabian controlled groups and others and she told the iranian women
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:58.000]  i want to hear what he has to say about signing this back this up i'll play the rest of a minute
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.600]  just just back it up we'll go to it a minute no rush he says something after he signed it
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:06.720]  the truth is that lindesor sir and others you know when their women took their burkas off a
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.760]  few months ago in protest and got shot the street sorcer said they were basically grandstanding
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:15.680]  wear your hijab shut up that's why you know she's sword sorrows funded
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:22.320]  but let me just go through the speech it's true the iranian people don't want to be under the
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:27.360]  mulas that part's true it's true that he's brought north korea to the table and he's now cut north
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.560]  korea off from iran when they're being analyzed partially it's true that iran is developing
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:39.360]  long-range icb m's that can hit major capitals all over the northern hemisphere they can already
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:48.080]  hit moscow they can already hit paris they can already hit berlin it's true that if iran gets
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:51.360]  nukes the word is already have some is that they're not deliverable that's why you heard
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:56.400]  you really talk about the icb m's more than atomic weapons because that's the big issues the delivery
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:02.160]  system you notice he talked about a nuke race and so saudi arabia and others are then going to want
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:09.520]  nuclear weapons just like pakistan and india then he talked about spreading terror and hezbollah
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:14.720]  in the middle east iran has not really been offensively bombing or blowing anybody up
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.320]  i'm not defending hezbollah you know attacking on marine corps base 30 something years ago
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.240]  they have been fighting isis and the and the whole arab spring that obama and hillary and
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:29.520]  mccain funded so that's the only area where what trump said really is inaccurate he knows
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:34.000]  that he said it during the campaign that hillary and mccain obama were the founders of isis and
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.760]  funded al qaeda and then it was shameful and then of course you've got new york city and family
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:45.200]  suing iran for 911 when there's no evidence of that saudi arabia folks
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.280]  now they're also suing saudi arabia as well and martin was out come
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:58.400]  him we've been there day one exposing the whole thing but then you've got the lesson of libya
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:03.200]  libya eight years before it was liberated and destroyed and turned over to al qaeda
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:09.200]  lu mark adafi stopped terror worked with the west obama said come in from the dark
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:12.640]  invest in the west let us all in and they set him up and killed him
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:18.400]  and he was calling obama desperately while the us was bombing him saying why did you do that
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.640]  you lied to me in paris you lied to me in germany you lied in all those meetings it was
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:29.120]  publicly you said i mean i did everything you wanted i invested 40 billion in u.s french
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:33.600]  and other banks and you they took it which was for the people of africa
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:40.000]  so in qaddafi stood up for the libyan people he wasn't perfect they called him a terrorist
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.080]  when he came in and did what the west said they set him up so comes up they're saying
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:48.560]  work with us it's going to be beautiful it's going to be great it's all going to be happy
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:53.360]  that's what north korea said promise you won't preemptively attack us if we get rid of the nooks
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:58.960]  and promise you'll pull the u.s military out of south korea i'm not defending north korea the
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:04.400]  point is they know because of obama and the clintons that you disarm you get double crossed
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:10.000]  syria did nothing look what happened to them so those are the different angles of different
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.880]  pieces was the iran nuclear deal bad yes was it a hundred and thirty something billion dollar
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:20.640]  scam that obama got kicked back from the table from that's been confirmed the deal's bad trumps
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:24.640]  right about that and it's true that iran has rhetoric like they're going to blow up israel
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:29.680]  and i don't want to blow up israel i don't hate israel he's getting young under political pressure
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:34.960]  does he want a diversion like this yes those are all the pragmatic points that are going on
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:43.120]  it was a good thing that the president did not go ahead with sanctions now he's given him a chance
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:46.560]  to come to the table but he's given him already a year and a half so i don't think you'll give him
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:52.640]  more in a couple weeks right now let's go ahead and finish up with what he said after the signing
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:41:05.760]  here it is thank you very much this will make america much safer thank you very much thank you
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:12.400]  right now going you know it will be there very shortly in a matter of virtual probably an hour
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:18.960]  he's got meetings set up we have our meeting scheduled we have our meeting set the location
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:24.800]  is picked the time and everything is picked and we look forward to have a very great success we
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:30.400]  think uh relationships are building with north korea we'll see how it all works out maybe it will
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:35.920]  maybe it won't but it can be a great thing for north korea south korea japan and the entire world
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:42.560]  we hope it all works out thank you very much there you go so the president is genuinely trying to
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:49.600]  bring peace not globalists will all soon be finding out we will soon be finding out it would be a
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:55.840]  great thing if they are we'll soon be finding out thank you very much not globalist destabilization
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:00.400]  because they want ongoing crisis trump's trying to end all that that's why the globalists are so mad
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:06.320]  they want an ongoing strategy of tension this is live coverage of the president and so there you go

[02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:13.840]  article showing this poor lady imma jane gonzalez who has the same name as imma gonzalez the shaved

[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:05.920]  suburbs what do you make of those rules uh i make of the fact that um just when you think the washington
[02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:12.160]  post can't get things anymore wrong they do and that that is an outrageous and ridiculous claim
[02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:18.080]  the first lady lives here at the white house we see her regularly um and i think that's a something
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:23.200]  that belongs in tabloid gossip not on the front pages of the washington post and i hope that they'll
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:28.880]  do better next time peter and i apologize i know we're on so many tv stations other people can do

[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:45.520]  followed i received a number of invitations from kiwis to permanently relocate here
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:53.040]  and i must say i really did appreciate the offers gave them some thought
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:54:03.280]  but i'm going to state put because we have work to do in my country as well so it's not your country
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:10.880]  which all right let's go to the next clip michelle obama still can't believe women voted for trump
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:16.320]  the condescension or the news said hillary said dumb white women listen to their husbands
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:20.800]  oh yeah let me tell you the white women are really down on their knees in this country
[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:25.760]  well you go to the average house around this country the women are really the women are like
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:31.120]  perched on pink pillows compared to a lot of men a lot of men are slobs whatever the point is
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:34.480]  the idea that women voted for trump because their husbands told them to
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:40.880]  no that's you the democratic party like your little buddy uh you know the new york attorney
[02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:47.200]  general and calling women brown slaves and as he savagely rapes him or whatever but that's okay
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:54.160]  because he's a me too guy and friends with komo and soros so here's michelle oh you know sorry in
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:55:10.720]  light of this last election i'm concerned about us as women and how we think about what is going on
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:17.680]  in our heads where we let that happen you know and the economy came back and everything else so i do
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:22.880]  wonder the possibility to back it up yeah because like the illegal alien gets to shoot the woman in
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:26.960]  the back he doesn't get in trouble they rape they kill women are getting murdered all the place by
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:31.280]  his llamasist in europe the left says well they can't be charged for raping ten-year-old girls
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:37.040]  what's wrong with you lady with chicago you run a total hellhole you're a monster you're a fraud
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:41.840]  you're a scammer so yeah she does wonder what's wrong with women well there are a lot of women
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:46.960]  listening to you that's the problem here it is about each other and what and what's really going on
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:54.960]  i mean i i think more about what what what is going on in our heads where we let that happen
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:03.840]  common sense you know um so i do wonder what are what are young girls dreaming about if we're still
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.680]  there we're not living under you lady that's what you tell them what to eat for lunch person

[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:27.440]  on now one more clip before we go to break come back with matt bracken this is very important
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:31.200]  because again they they they tell you turn people off you ought to wait a while before you turn them
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:35.760]  off a lot of times they come back my uncle was in a tumor for six months came back he's fine today
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:40.480]  well here's a clip about the family and the child or they'd already decided to turn him off but then
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:45.920]  he came back here it is two months ago trinton was at a friend's house sitting in a small utility
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:52.240]  trailer like this one while being pulled by a dune buggy a day of playing soon turned terrifying
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:59.760]  and flipped and i hit the concrete and the trailer landed on top of my head after that i
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:07.040]  don't remember anything trinton was rushed to us a medical center he had seven skull fractures
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:13.040]  and all i saw was a stretcher with his feet they actually stapled that side shut so they
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:20.080]  could get him back breathing but he was dead a total of 15 minutes um when he came back they
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:30.240]  said he would never be normal again um they told me the oxidation problems would be so bad to his
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:34.480]  brain that he would be a vegetable but even if he made it we're gonna go to break and come back
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:40.640]  with the rest of it but they didn't they they didn't and he came back and he's fine now to remember

[03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:13.040]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:19.040]  um when he came back the city would never be a normal one
[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:27.520]  um they told me the oxidation problems would be so bad to his brain that he would be a vegetable
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:34.080]  even if he made it for the next several days trinton was brain dead and barely breathing
[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:40.480]  his parents faced with a difficult decision they signed the papers to donate his organs five kids
[03:00:40.480 --> 03:00:48.000]  need organs but matched and it was unfair to keep bringing back um because it was just damaging
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:55.680]  his organs even more but a day before doctors were set to pull the plug trinton started coming back
[03:00:55.680 --> 03:01:01.360]  he believes he was in heaven i was walking down it was more like an open field walking straight
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:08.000]  there's no other explanation but god there's no other way that i could have came back even the
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:15.680]  doctors said slowly but surely trinton is making strides beyond what anyone expected all right
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:24.640]  he's a miracle and he just amazes everybody every day now my dad um has been a physician at
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:28.240]  dentistry also an oral surgeon and he said when i was growing up when i was 15 about to get my
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:32.800]  driver's license he said don't sign the organ donor card i said why and he said well a lot of
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:37.040]  hospitals actually won't save you to get the organs some of them are corrupt some are making money
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:41.440]  off of it some of the doctors on part of the hospitals and i thought he was full of it until
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:46.480]  it came out on 60 minutes about five years later and i was sitting at my grandparents house in
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:54.240]  austin watching tv and they admitted on there that in austin dallas chicago and it listed cities
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:58.000]  where they were basically letting people die i'm not saying this happened in the case of this young
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  man so they could get their organs they were telling him his organs are damaged man we need to take
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:07.200]  him off live sport we want to get those organs for somebody else but she waited just another day
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:12.880]  and he lived so i'm telling you this is something you need to know about that's why we covered that
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:17.600]  now savannah hernan does one of the new reporters she's done some great uh interviews on the street

[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:55.120]  savannah what do you make of that young boy being in a coma and they'd already signed the order to
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:03:01.920]  basically let him dive then he came back it's definitely awful heartbreaking for sure well
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:05.680]  we're going to break all that don't we come back on the other side and of course we've got a matt
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:11.280]  brackham here matt you've got a lot to cover don't you yeah it's quite a day breaking news that's
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:16.880]  for sure let me ask you this question before we got a break and i have a gut level thing with the
[03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:21.680]  left is losing the globalists are losing and and and that they're going to strike back i mean i keep
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:26.080]  going back to that i'm really concerned that they're not going to give up what do you what do you think
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:32.000]  they totally won't give up this has been going on you know for for nearly a century
[03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:41.120]  this pushed to globalism the the calergie plan uh under many names and they'll never quit you know
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:48.480]  the there was fdr who was cooperating with stalin to ensure communism would take over east europe
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:55.040]  i mean he literally did that stalin invaded eastern europe in american trucks uh sent under
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:04:03.680]  lendlis as the top priority and now we we send billions to iran it's sort of a a replay of the
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:11.440]  same theme either naive politicians or corrupt or subverted politicians make deals with our enemies
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:18.560]  uh all in the name of eventually converging with our enemies in the in the middle somewhere between
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:25.280]  communism and freedom or between islamism and freedom of course that's foolish that's right
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:31.840]  that's the that's the un 7277 public law plan all right all right we'll be right back with matt

[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:18.480]  alex jones there's a lot of controversy around this that work about alex jones google is being
[03:06:18.480 --> 03:06:24.160]  accused of hiding negative stories about hillary and her campaign by catching his algorithm to
[03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:36.480]  bury stories like the clinton body count story that's according to website info wars the coverage is
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:42.480]  shocked to death and mental benefit jfk was shot from the back and the front it was almost a
[03:06:42.480 --> 03:06:54.720]  regular plan in motion it just panicked i think this is a national security imperative we have clear
[03:06:54.720 --> 03:07:01.920]  things that we do not understand how they work operating areas that we can't control us oh
[03:07:01.920 --> 03:07:06.960]  is this global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge is real
[03:07:06.960 --> 03:07:12.240]  claims the attack was accidental but some former us naval officers say it was on purpose they
[03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:18.560]  describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover russian intelligence compiled a dossier
[03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:25.040]  on mr trump during visits to muska russian stop denied everything he called it all fake news
[03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:31.760]  and he accused cnn of being fake news this is a national operation if they kill trump or remove
[03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:37.520]  trump it will cause a massive civil war in this country this is a female high-level religion
[03:07:37.520 --> 03:07:44.480]  we are at war with russia are you aware that mr stone also stated publicly that he was in direct
[03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:50.000]  communication with jillian assange and wikis the white house the president are citing info wars
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:56.800]  they can shut us down you're next if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:05.360]  it's alex jones thanks for tuning in to the fourth hour of the alex jones show my name is savannah
[03:08:05.360 --> 03:08:10.400]  hernandez and we're here with your host today matthew bracken former navy seal and bestselling
[03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:16.640]  author how you doing matt pretty good we're gonna just uh this is sort of the blind leading the
[03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:22.960]  blind here i'm not i'm not exactly a pro at this yet either so if everybody bears with us we'll
[03:08:22.960 --> 03:08:28.720]  stumble through it and we'll we'll practice uh by taking some calls today after i have a few things
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:41.040]  to say and the uh the number to the studio is 877-789-2539 or alex at the end but everybody
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:46.640]  should have that on speed dial anyway and uh i wouldn't continue with what we were talking about
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:53.920]  with alex before the break and that's that what we're seeing today is a is a huge mega battle
[03:08:53.920 --> 03:08:59.360]  actually there are several mega battles being fought one obviously in washington dc and the
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:08.160]  united states is between muhler rozenstein brennan clapper comey i'll call them the traitors and
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:15.440]  president trump and the the swamp drainers that's one one obvious axis of this huge war that's
[03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:23.760]  going on but another one at a much bigger level the real macro level is the globalists versus
[03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:30.320]  the free people of various nations that just want to remain citizens of their countries
[03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:36.800]  and live in freedom the people that want to put us in this global serfdom they've had a plan that's
[03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:44.720]  been working very well for the last century uh it it was it was um really going in parallel
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:51.840]  with the bolsheviks in russia while at we were fighting them in the cold war they were infiltrating
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:59.200]  us and subverting us from within and while we won the military side of the cold war the ussr
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:08.000]  is no well is no longer uh around their subversive uh their subversive plan worked brilliantly and
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:15.600]  it's it's not very well understood but the russians the soviets spent more money and put more of their
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:22.320]  talented manpower into subversion and espionage than they'd ever did into tanks and missiles
[03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:28.480]  so when we look at the at the surface level and say well we beat them in the cold war
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:33.520]  how can you say we beat them in the cold war when you look at our colleges and they're all
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:41.200]  spewing marxism this is this is really uh now coming up the third century of marxism we've just
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:47.760]  seen the eu put up a giant statue of marx in europe that was a gift from the chinese communists
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:55.840]  the eu is not ashamed of communism in fact they co-opted much of it uh this was this was called
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:11:04.000]  even you know for the last 75 years the convergence theory this was american socialists pretending
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:11.600]  to be american democrats but they're socialists and they were and they were believing all along that
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:18.880]  we had to drag america and the ussr together and form a convergent political system that
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:25.680]  would work globally well they never quit just because the ussr went away they never quit and
[03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:32.080]  we're seeing it now and this the same type of subversion with from within it's not only in
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:37.840]  effect with the socialists you know the old communists we see it today also with the islamists
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:44.560]  they've they've been so effective at subverting us from within in fact when obama came came into
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:54.480]  power uh his new fbi director muhler conducted a purge of fbi and all uh federal law enforcement
[03:11:54.480 --> 03:12:03.120]  training manuals and protocols to eliminate every mention of jihad of of uh you know islamic terrorism
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:09.520]  and basically whitewashed it to the point now where american generals who are selected by you
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:17.520]  know the senate american generals are politically correct uh pawns of this subversion they willingly
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:25.680]  go along with this mind scrub where there's no danger from islam and we are going to somehow
[03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:31.920]  converge with islam the peaceful islam which is just the uh you know the halfway house to
[03:12:31.920 --> 03:12:38.880]  being fully islamified so between socialism and islamism i think that danger has never been
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:48.240]  greater today president trump throughout john carrey's uh iran deal and this is like this is a
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:55.280]  direct attack at the globalist forces this wasn't just the usa and iran this was the usa
[03:12:55.280 --> 03:13:01.600]  plus the european powers so we're going to we're going to see some kind of a brushback pitch
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:09.360]  against trump i have no doubt and the the socialist and islamist agents of influence
[03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:14.400]  within our government and within european governments they're going they're not working
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:22.160]  for our behalf i would really recommend to people more than anything else i've read in the last decade
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:28.720]  pick up a copy of of uh diana west american betrayal it lays it out better than anything
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:35.680]  i've ever read chapter and verse it's it's really deep this um this subversion that we've undergone
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:43.040]  is extremely deep the patriots are are attacked and the traders are praised and protected and
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:48.480]  we're seeing it from the mule investigation to this iran deal these are very dangerous times
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:54.880]  we need to support president trump through this and we can definitely expect the globalist forces
[03:13:54.880 --> 03:14:04.400]  to counterattack now so um if we have time we can go to a go to the first caller um maybe uh alex
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:15.520]  in michigan we can uh take him first caller how are we doing we hey what's going on i guess
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:25.040]  i can hear you can hear me yep um i just i would say uh watch out for false flags and
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:33.840]  classic places like afghanistan and the middle east to trigger um you know the deep state
[03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:39.600]  involvement or i don't know watch out for false flags on both sides i would say
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:46.240]  okay and uh yeah you're doing a really good job thanks you know something that's not really
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:53.600]  uh mentioned much it's spoken of mostly strictly in economic terms when we made this deal when
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:58.720]  kerry obama and jared who's iranian valerie jaret when they made this deal with iran
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:04.560]  they not only gave billions of dollars you know through bank transactions they gave
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:12.560]  1.7 billion dollars in cash which was plain loads palette loads of cash hundred dollar bills
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:21.360]  hundred euro notes what people don't really consider very often i think is that cash untraceable
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:30.720]  cash is the best way that there is to finance uh terrorism actions major operations espionage rings
[03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:36.480]  because all right mr racken loaded with cash and taken anywhere in a diplomatic pouch and
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:40.240]  mr racken we're actually going to go to a short break here but definitely pick up where um you

[03:20:27.200 --> 03:20:35.120]  your host matt bracken bestselling author and former navy seal hey savannah i wanted to mention
[03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:40.240]  while i'm thinking about it um since i was i'm on the show today i put my first novel
[03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:47.680]  into a kindle free run it's this book right here this is the original uh false flag black
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:54.240]  op assault rifle massacre novel and you can download it on kindle right now it's the
[03:20:54.240 --> 03:21:00.960]  not my first novel the one that started it off begins on page one with uh with an assault rifle
[03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:06.720]  being fired into a stadium resulting in the banning of all semi-automatic weapons but it's
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:14.000]  not done by the you know the militia the deranged militia veteran who's killed at the scene he's
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:19.280]  not the one who did it it's a false flag operation i think alex jones fans will be
[03:21:19.280 --> 03:21:23.600]  pretty interested in it anyway um getting back to what i was just speaking about
[03:21:24.240 --> 03:21:32.640]  with iran and the cash given to iran the the 9 11 commission said that the entire 9 11 attack
[03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:39.600]  which was you know the the pentagon the the twin towers and the the plane which was aiming i believe
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:46.480]  for the capital but went down in in uh in pennsylvania that entire attack cost five hundred thousand
[03:21:46.480 --> 03:21:57.600]  dollars cash and what what we did by giving iran 1.7 billion dollars in cash was to to fund them
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:22:08.400]  to the tune of thousands of 9 11 size attacks untraceable cash in 1994 iranian diplomats
[03:22:08.400 --> 03:22:16.160]  this was all unraveled years later but iranian diplomats gave cash to jihad terrorists and
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:25.680]  Buenos iris they blew up a a big israeli cultural center jewish cultural center killed 85 wounded
[03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:32.800]  hundreds basically destroyed an entire you know like city block a major a major bombing this was
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:39.360]  done with a diplomatic pouch you know the diplomatic pouch bought the explosives the cash and that's
[03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:46.400]  what obama and kerry did they handed iran untraceable cash which can turn up for years to come in the
[03:22:46.400 --> 03:22:52.560]  future uh you know and this this long game this is something we're not used to we think tend to
[03:22:52.560 --> 03:23:00.640]  think in congressional cycles just get past the next election our enemies think in decades generations
[03:23:00.640 --> 03:23:09.120]  and even centuries you know the islamic threat's been going on for 1400 years it has no off switch
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:16.880]  and now it looks like the communists are the same way and i'm i'm reminded of a book i read a long
[03:23:16.880 --> 03:23:25.360]  time ago called escape from cold it's cold it's castle in germany was a prison for the hard core
[03:23:25.360 --> 03:23:34.720]  escape artists of the mostly british and some americans one of the one of the brits was his
[03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:42.320]  idea was if he couldn't escape he was going to put dry jars that would cause dry rot up in the
[03:23:42.320 --> 03:23:48.000]  rafters of the castle and the other guys said what are you going to do that why are you doing that
[03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:53.280]  the war is going to be over in a year a couple years you're going to destroy the castle he said
[03:23:53.280 --> 03:23:59.280]  yeah i don't care if the war is over i don't care if the castle falls down in 20 years or 50 years
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:05.920]  i'm going to rot it i'm going to you know to put rot up into the rafters and that's what it looks
[03:24:05.920 --> 03:24:12.160]  like the soviets did even if they they lost the cold war to the extent that there's no more ussr
[03:24:12.800 --> 03:24:19.040]  their most effective weapon was this rot weapon that they introduced inside of the usa all you
[03:24:19.040 --> 03:24:23.520]  have to do is look at our schools you know look at the decadence and the moral corruption the
[03:24:23.520 --> 03:24:31.600]  confute gender confusion just go down the list their subversive uh uh fighting plan was by far
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:38.400]  their most effective they might not have won but i think they've destroyed us from within and at the
[03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:46.080]  same time it looks like the jihadists the islamists they've won they've purged their our law enforcement
[03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:53.520]  from any kind of effective counter jihad training or or protocols policies in fact
[03:24:53.520 --> 03:25:00.720]  if you look at what muhler did he put blinders on the fbi he made it illegal to surveil mosques for
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:08.560]  example he made it illegal to keep track of these traveling imams which are in world war two terms
[03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:16.160]  would be like s s kernels undercover traveling from mosque to mosque he made it illegal to
[03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:23.840]  monitor them attract them the result was the boston bombing san bernadino uh or lando and
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:31.680]  for hood and so on this wasn't this was done from within by people who are either knowing traders
[03:25:31.680 --> 03:25:38.960]  or unwitting dupes and my point my point here is to point at these people and call them what they are
[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:45.760]  which is traders not to you know push the foot around anymore being polite being politically
[03:25:45.760 --> 03:25:51.520]  correct we're in a death struggle and we need to to fight back like we're in a death struggle
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:57.920]  our enemies use our own our own kindness against us they use our politeness as a weapon you know
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:03.520]  they know that they can backstab us and we won't even know what's happening you know the the one
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:09.440]  that's up the meme that's up right now the three guys on the bottom were three of the senior american
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:17.040]  advisors to fdr they were all soviet spies they were soviet agents you know they were corrupt
[03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:24.080]  they were working for the other side and i'm not saying that brennan clapper and comey on top are
[03:26:24.080 --> 03:26:29.600]  obviously they're not soviet spies there's no more ussr but you could say they're deep state or
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:37.120]  globalist agents for sure they're working against donald trump and you know the they make america
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:43.680]  great again movement they're working for this deep state which is just the american branch of
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:52.000]  of you know globalism so i i'm i'm here to say look we can't anymore be polite if we are if we
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:59.600]  stay polite and within the acceptable bounds of you know normal uh pc behavior we're going to lose
[03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:06.880]  we're going to go all the way to the to the boxcars to the gulags unless we start seeing what's going
[03:27:06.880 --> 03:27:15.280]  on you know calling out the our enemies domestic and foreign and fighting back hard anyway that's
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:21.840]  enough of that rant um we have a caller from las vegas i believe it had an interesting uh it's
[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:27.680]  something i hadn't even heard of um you can put the the vegas caller on now if we have time right

[03:33:54.000 --> 03:34:00.080]  carnival and yeah i mean it's to me it's it's um people will make money off of whatever i mean
[03:34:00.080 --> 03:34:06.400]  they would if slavery was legal there'd be people in chains being marched out and in a sense this
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:14.480]  is psychological slavery uh make making something basically a drug fest in 2018 you turn on the tv
[03:34:14.480 --> 03:34:21.840]  and it's all about the opioid crisis yet yet people are making money peddling a venue which is
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:30.240]  basically an open-air drug fest to to for for kids and i mean to me it's a sign of the decadence
[03:34:30.240 --> 03:34:35.920]  and corruption inside of our culture you know this is that subversion this tearing down of our
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:42.320]  our social fabric that's been so successful frank any any more information on that
[03:34:42.320 --> 03:34:47.520]  just so the big thing is any volunteers want to come help and inform the law enforcement
[03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:53.280]  you're welcome please help save a lot this big picture is this live nation michael rapino also

[03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:36.560]  dealer so all you people that were injured sue live nation and james muren because they allowed
[03:35:36.560 --> 03:35:41.280]  dangerous people onto their property and those dangerous people hurt the people there that's
[03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:45.840]  what you do when you have a culture you're responsible for your people so it's a big picture

[03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:41.920]  predicted that the north korea situation was a smug screen and the real target was iran
[03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:51.520]  and two things are going to happen following trump's decisions of this week he's decided
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:57.120]  not to go to pyongyang or to go to north korea at all and he's also decided to withdraw from this
[03:36:57.120 --> 03:37:06.000]  this iran deal you think he won't you think he will not have a meeting at in uh at the dmz in korea
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:10.720]  well i don't think so i think he's going to go to a third party country
[03:37:13.280 --> 03:37:16.640]  i don't know i don't i don't think that i don't think that kim jong-un will leave
[03:37:18.480 --> 03:37:23.360]  sorry i think that the league the north korean leader will be afraid to leave north korea
[03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:29.520]  but he'll meet at the dmz or he won't meet at all because if he leaves the country the generals
[03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:35.120]  that he leaves behind might think that he's selling them out and there might be a coup at home
[03:37:35.840 --> 03:37:41.440]  or if he leaves he's going to be afraid that he'll be kidnapped or drugged because they've all done
[03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:46.320]  these things you know the north koreans are are famous for kidnapping innocent people dragging
[03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:53.120]  them back and they're also famous for drugging people they even used a little dose of cyanide
[03:37:53.120 --> 03:38:00.240]  or some kind of nerve gas to conduct an assassination just just a few months ago so i i don't see kim
[03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:07.040]  kim jong-un leaving north korea maybe he'll step into the dmz that's that's as far as he'll go
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:15.520]  i believe well he went to china recently so true but he went he went by train and he didn't go far
[03:38:15.520 --> 03:38:24.240]  into china i mean his own train yeah i mean if the meeting is in the dmz or near north korea
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:29.920]  or or in north korea i mean what i was suggesting was that trump should go to pyong yang now what
[03:38:29.920 --> 03:38:36.320]  that would do is it would give kim jong-un face which is a local it's you know you have to understand
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:42.800]  the culture we give him the face to make the concessions that trump wants him to make and also
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:49.040]  give trump the credit for them and as things stand now after trumps pulled out of the iran deal
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:55.920]  i think that the north koreans will actually work to cut trump out of this deal completely
[03:38:56.640 --> 03:39:01.760]  because if you look at it from that perspective how could any country enter into an agreement
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:08.240]  with the united states particularly with trump when he's reneged on his uh commitments on
[03:39:08.240 --> 03:39:12.800]  well under the united states commitments to the iran deal no that's that's false so you
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:18.640]  don't understand this was not a treaty what what obama carrey and valery jaret pulled was just a
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:24.640]  an executive executive decision which can be undone by the next president it was not a treaty
[03:39:24.640 --> 03:39:30.720]  which would require two-thirds of the senate um the you know the the president can declare
[03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:36.400]  that all the illegal aliens can stay in the united states that's not the same as passing a law
[03:39:36.400 --> 03:39:41.920]  the next president can can just undo undo it yeah i'd like to read something uh i just saw this
[03:39:41.920 --> 03:39:50.480]  today so this is a blogger a writer named named nyquist jr jeff nyquist this is about the north
[03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:56.640]  korean overtures and it could be applicable also i think to islam equally as well as communism
[03:39:56.640 --> 03:40:03.760]  this is why i'm really against trump meeting this guy without extracting immense concessions
[03:40:03.760 --> 03:40:08.720]  you have to keep in mind in north korea currently there are a couple hundred thousand people in
[03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:17.520]  the harshest gulags as bad as anything understalin uh medical experimentation horrible physical
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:23.680]  corporal punishment of entire families including children and grandchildren of of bad comrades
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:30.880]  let me read this about the recent overtures to korea uh this was posted on diana west's blog
[03:40:30.880 --> 03:40:38.800]  by but it's by uh uh jeff nyquist it's about is this real than the korean overtures says
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:44.080]  at first you cannot talk to the communist because his goal was to destroy you i mean
[03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:49.360]  after all that's what he has said all along but eventually you talk to him and find yourself
[03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:55.200]  shaking his hand he is a human being after all he is charming why were you ever afraid
[03:40:55.200 --> 03:41:02.160]  then you forget that he's a communist and you forget what communism signifies you decide to
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:09.760]  make deals with him you even say he's not really a communist and he nods his head nearly everyone
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:16.320]  is happy about the deals you make and the resulting promises of peace you are praised by everyone
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:22.800]  it feels so good then you discover that the communists are cheating you in various ways
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:29.840]  is every agreement you signed was broken before the ink was dry but you can say nothing because
[03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:36.240]  you will look like an idiot for trusting in criminals and murderers everyone who praised
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:44.240]  these deals and supported you must also remain silent for nobody wants to appear foolish the
[03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:51.120]  years passed by and your country grows weaker in relation to the communist power you are sufficiently
[03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:57.840]  self-defeat deceived that you will fail to realize that enemy agents are inside your own government
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:05.520]  you also fail to notice that they are work inside of your allied governments these agents
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:12.480]  promote each other and destroy the careers of honest public servants anyone who is corrupt
[03:42:12.480 --> 03:42:19.120]  or weak falls in line with them with these agents of course all this happened because
[03:42:19.120 --> 03:42:25.280]  you shook the murderer's hand all right and we are actually going back to a short break

[03:47:29.600 --> 03:47:36.720]  matt bracken former navy seal and best-selling book author hi i i'm sorry i went long there i was a
[03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:42.160]  little bit passionate um i just need to back up a line and finish this because i think it's really
[03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:49.040]  important okay we're talking about how a country can become so self-deluded that they sign deals with
[03:47:49.040 --> 03:47:54.240]  the devil and once they learn that the devil really is the devil they're so ashamed and embarrassed
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:48:00.480]  for making the deal that they pretend outwardly and even to themselves that the devil's not the
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:08.240]  devil so this was by this is by uh jeff nyquist let me finish these agents promote each other
[03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:14.880]  doesn't that sound like mueller comey rozenstein they all work behind the scenes making deals
[03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:21.840]  with each other sabotaging our own country these agents promote each other and destroy the careers
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:28.800]  of honest public servants anyone who is corrupt or weak falls in line with them of course all
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:35.120]  this happened because you shook this murderer's hand you sat down with a criminal and compromised
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:43.120]  yourself you committed a wicked act and called it good and posterity will curse you we began this
[03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:52.480]  under f dr when he was so so inflamed to make an alliance with stalin and converge capitalism and
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:49:00.000]  communism that he was willing to hide the facts of the ukrainian terror famine of the great purges
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:06.240]  of the cat in forest massacre of the polish officers these things were actively suppressed
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:14.000]  censored you know kept out of american consciousness we made the deal with the devil lately we made
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:22.080]  another deal with the devil with iran with paying terrorist murderers cash trying to somehow
[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:31.040]  turn the devil into into a normal nation and if if trump makes a deal with kim jong-soon
[03:49:31.040 --> 03:49:37.840]  that keeps him as the murderer in charge of a vast gulag this will be a really evil act the
[03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:44.880]  people who are languishing and suffering in north korean concentration camps want to hear a call
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:50.960]  for freedom they don't want to see that their dictator has cemented his power for the rest of
[03:49:50.960 --> 03:49:59.120]  his life on the basis of some promises which they'll just lie about anyway so i'm i say hold out for
[03:49:59.120 --> 03:50:06.400]  freedom shine the light into these gulags and call an evil empire an evil empire don't shake hands
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:13.600]  with you know with bloody dictators not mal not polpot not hitler not stalin stand for freedom
[03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:21.200]  anyway uh tom i i um i think i did enough on that no it's time for me to go to another call
[03:50:21.200 --> 03:50:29.360]  i see jim's been holding in florida for a long time can we uh can we pick up jim now thanks thank
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:36.720]  you matt how you doing great thanks um wanted to put an idea on the table for you and fellow
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:45.440]  infill warriors john hannity had mentioned on his program that we know that hillary's servers
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:51.040]  were hacked by five foreign entities he didn't mention who they were but he said we know they
[03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:56.240]  were hillary's private servers were hacked by five foreign entities but then it hit me like a ton
[03:50:56.240 --> 03:51:03.440]  of bricks what if this whole russian hacking thing was a red herring to cover the fact that
[03:51:03.440 --> 03:51:11.040]  that's where the emails came from that one of those five agents made those things public to
[03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:16.560]  weekly leaks or whoever for money or whatever but that's where the emails came from your thoughts
[03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:24.640]  well i i'm still a um going along with uh julien assange and the people who believe that
[03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:30.720]  it's impossible that the that the uh that the emails the dnc servers were hacked from outside
[03:51:30.720 --> 03:51:36.240]  that the speeds with which they were downloaded shows that it was somebody putting a thumb drive
[03:51:36.240 --> 03:51:41.440]  right into a computer right inside the headquarters and so it was probably an inside job
[03:51:41.440 --> 03:51:49.200]  um possibly uh uh what's his name uh seth rich or someone else like him and we are
[03:51:49.200 --> 03:51:54.640]  indoor into a realm where uh people will die they will do wetworks to take care of of uh
[03:51:54.640 --> 03:52:00.960]  loose ends i think that um that michael hastings was killed to keep him from going after and
[03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:07.600]  exposing uh john brennan the way he had exposed general stanley in the crystal i think that uh
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:15.120]  that the the truth about the dnc servers is is going to be very damning the fact that the fbi
[03:52:15.120 --> 03:52:21.840]  rolled over you know that it says on their shield fidelity bravery integrity they rolled over and
[03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:28.560]  allowed the dnc to hire their own their own examiners i mean when does that ever happen if
[03:52:28.560 --> 03:52:33.840]  you're called in by the fbi or the irs and they say we'd like to see your computer and you say
[03:52:33.840 --> 03:52:38.000]  that's all right i think i won't i think i'll call my own expert and then i'll let you know what
[03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:45.440]  i find out see how that goes for you um i i hope that in the next couple of weeks this inspector
[03:52:45.440 --> 03:52:53.360]  general report drops the optimistic side of this is that sessions has just been playing uh low key
[03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:59.520]  in order to prevent any charges that he's a political actor but meanwhile this outside
[03:52:59.520 --> 03:53:07.520]  prosecutor huber is working with the ig and horowitz to prepare indictments to come come down
[03:53:07.520 --> 03:53:14.640]  rapidly after the ig report which is due out sometime this month hopefully but we'll see this
[03:53:14.640 --> 03:53:21.200]  is a clash of titans what we're seeing in the in the media is maybe one percent it's like looking
[03:53:21.200 --> 03:53:26.800]  through a keyhole compared to the real battle that's going on this is a civil war within our
[03:53:26.800 --> 03:53:33.840]  government and on the one side are the the forces of socialism and globalism you know they'll scoff
[03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:39.520]  at that they'll say oh no i'm a patriotic american they're lying you have to remember
[03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:46.400]  the concept of strategic deception what the same thing that muslims call takia they believe in
[03:53:46.400 --> 03:53:53.520]  their end so much that they believe that it is it is completely justifiable to lie to our faces
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:59.440]  and because we're honorable people will believe them they consider that we're suckers for believing
[03:53:59.440 --> 03:54:06.720]  them that were marks that were sheep we're so stupid that we believe liars and we need to get
[03:54:06.720 --> 03:54:13.280]  rid of that mindset and know what you know when liars are lying so the the people that are conducting
[03:54:13.280 --> 03:54:19.360]  this deep state coup i hope that they all go to prison i hope we find out who killed seth rich
[03:54:19.360 --> 03:54:25.200]  i hope we find out who killed michael hasting and you know many other things like this because you
[03:54:25.200 --> 03:54:31.200]  know this country is not going to be the free country we think it is if this coup is allowed
[03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:36.880]  to succeed and you know this is a this is a an epic battle and it's going on right now

[03:55:20.960 --> 03:55:28.960]  years old this year and when i looked up the definition of the word microphone from 1945
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:38.080]  it talked about any contrivance that allows you to hear something that normally the the normal human
[03:55:38.080 --> 03:55:45.200]  hearing wouldn't be able to perceive and in the book spy chips it talked about the ambassador
