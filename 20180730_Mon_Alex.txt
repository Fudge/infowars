[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  We are drugs out. We are following other people's opinions. We are controlled by the media. Today it all changes. This reality has been forced upon us. It is a choice. Just like when I said slavery is a choice. Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[00:21.000 --> 00:35.000]  So we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you. How are we going to get a different result out of hate? Why don't we just try love? Why don't we just try love? We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[00:35.000 --> 00:50.000]  You know sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something. Steve Jobs is crazy. Now we all know Steve Jobs phones. They say drugs crazy. They say I'm crazy. But I'm here to show love. It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:50.000 --> 01:03.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:03.000 --> 01:23.000]  This is the Fourth Amendment. It reads, the right of the people to be secure in their person's houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[01:23.000 --> 01:36.000]  It's pretty straightforward. So why is it that we have to adopt laws to enforce this law of the land against the very organization sworn to uphold the Fourth Amendment? It's madness. But that's exactly what's happening.
[01:36.000 --> 02:03.000]  Stingrays are not selective devices. If they are in your area, all cell phone calls will go through the stingray because that is the most powerful signal in that area. So everyone within a quarter of a mile will be passing through the stingray. Now if the police knew the phone number and knew the machine address of the device being used by the criminal they were attempting to listen to, that would be one thing.
[02:03.000 --> 02:18.000]  But in most cases they do not. They just know that the criminal lives nearby or is in an apartment here or is an automobile there. So they have to listen to everybody's conversation to filter out and find the actual person that they are interested in.
[02:18.000 --> 02:28.000]  Which means that every single conversation within a quarter of a mile is being listened to and has to be listened to to determine which conversation is the one that they're interested in.
[02:28.000 --> 02:42.000]  WorldNet Daily reports Shahid Buttar explained that the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a California bill SB 1186, would vastly strengthen oversight relative to the indefensible and completely opaque status quo.
[02:42.000 --> 03:02.000]  EFF supports the bill because it would expand transparency and community control over the acquisition of surveillance technology. For nearly a decade, the company Harris Corporation sold sophisticated military surveillance equipment to police departments across the United States without any elected policymakers knowing that their tools even existed.
[03:02.000 --> 03:15.000]  There is no municipality in America that has more than 5,000 people that does not have access to at least one of these devices. Some of the largest cities have many hundreds of these devices.
[03:15.000 --> 03:38.000]  The central problem with the stingrays, other than the fact that the Harris Corporation, almost in league with the government, has a contract so tightly bound that anyone who buys one cannot tell anybody else where they got it from, what the name of the product is, how much they paid for it, how many other products similar to it that they own or anything else.
[03:38.000 --> 03:59.000]  Think about that. They're saying that they signed a paper with a corporation that they're not going to disclose this information to a judge as required under the law, under the Constitution, that their non-disclosure agreement with this corporation is more important than the Constitution or any laws that we write subsequent to that.
[03:59.000 --> 04:14.000]  The surveillance state has grown like an STD that, of course, nobody wants. Automatic facial recognition and automatic number plate recognition have in the span of a few years become the norm in a big brother prison planet society.
[04:14.000 --> 04:29.000]  All the technocrats and their socialistocratic government soldiers need to do is apply the Chinese style social credit system on American citizens and a sliding slope for totalitarian domination is right around the corner.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  Unfortunately, we have reached the point where Americans need to demand the enforcement of their bill of rights now more than ever.
[04:37.000 --> 04:47.000]  That's why we've introduced the Info Wars Life Daily Digestive Pack to you.

[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.000 --> 06:51.000]  Thank you for watching.
[06:54.000 --> 07:10.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  Info Wars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.000]  It's a raging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[07:55.000 --> 08:02.000]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[08:02.000 --> 08:17.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  We love the American people.
[08:26.000 --> 08:40.000]  They came in peace.
[08:40.000 --> 08:51.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  This is CNN.
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[09:05.000 --> 09:14.000]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[09:14.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  John has a long mustache. John has a long mustache.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  People that had guns or things they wanted. They just took them away.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  Where?
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  Re-education camps. That's what they call it.
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families or recognize kids belong to whole communities.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  And we need to have camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  I'm a sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[10:43.000 --> 10:52.000]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.000]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Put your gun down, really?
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  Over it!
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[11:39.000 --> 11:49.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[11:59.000 --> 12:08.000]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  Wolverine!
[12:13.000 --> 12:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 30th day of July, 2018.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[12:26.000 --> 12:34.000]  Then we've got obviously the war room with another hunted American, Roger Stone, and of course Owen Schroyer hosting.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  I don't feel far from myself being a hunted, demonized, lied about individual because I know I'm on the right side of history.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  I know this is a globalist military propaganda operation.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  We're fighting and I signed up for this show.
[12:47.000 --> 12:56.000]  I expect it, but I will tell you the level of deception and lies by these people is so over the top and so duplicitous.
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  You can only know it when you're on the inside of it that it's a real education.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  I'm going to try my best today to go over some of that.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  Here's an example.
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.000]  I don't want our show to be the soap opera of what's happened to Alex Jones, but you've got everybody from Tucker Carlson,
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  to Senator Ted Cruz, to Sean Hannity coming out defending me and saying basically I'm being lied about,
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  setting a precedent to ban conservatives off the internet.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  That's totally Twilight Zone.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  There's millions of thousands of articles.
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  Every local TV station in the country basically is running this info pieces with pure lies about me.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  They've got something big planned.
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.000]  Now, here's just an example of what I've read this weekend.
[13:58.000 --> 14:07.000]  Alex Jones threatened to poison David Hogg.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  Totally untrue.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Alex Jones bullied a child and endangered them.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  Totally untrue.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  Alex Jones said mean things to transsexuals and bullied them.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Not true.
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  And that's what's amazing about all this is it's total lies.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  And then when they say it, they don't even link to where I said it or show it.
[14:39.000 --> 14:48.000]  I mean, I started seeing this weekend that Alex Jones made threats on David Hogg to poison his water.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  And that's why he's been taking off Facebook and YouTube.
[14:52.000 --> 15:01.000]  And I'm like, what? And then you see it and like Forbes saying I beat up a kid and they're not showing where the town was, when it happened, what the police report said.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Just stuff they've always have to do.
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  And it's in all these publications never showing it its next level lies.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  The likes of which I've never seen, I've never heard of.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  It just makes me ask what in the world is going on, ladies and gentlemen?
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  What in the world is going on?
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  You're asking why if you're watching TV when I'm wearing my sunglasses.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  This happens every few years.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  I fall asleep on my face with your eye open on the pillow.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  You know, you wake up your eyes stuck to the pillow.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  I got a big cut on my eye and it got infected and I look like a vampire or something.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  So the light hurts my eye.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  So I've got these shades on them.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  Visually impaired, I better not say blind, I'll be hate speech, I'll be banned off the air.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  So did you hear Alex Jones beat up a blind man today?
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  That'll be the next thing.
[15:56.000 --> 16:18.000]  This is Jessica Armand, founder of MyMagicMud.
[16:18.000 --> 16:28.000]  This is Jessica Armand, founder of MyMagicMud.

[17:57.000 --> 18:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[19:12.000 --> 19:25.000]  25, 50, 100, 250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship,
[19:25.000 --> 19:51.000]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  Now, it's the infowars official app taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[19:55.000 --> 20:03.000]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[20:03.000 --> 20:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.000 --> 20:44.000]  I want to lay something out right here in front of the whole world,
[20:44.000 --> 20:52.000]  people understand what is happening politically, culturally, economically, spiritually, genetically on this planet.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  And all of it's intertwined.
[20:56.000 --> 21:03.000]  Powerful corporate systems want control of the human life cycle.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  They want control of every action of humanity.
[21:06.000 --> 21:14.000]  They call it the final revolution where everything humans do naturally.
[21:14.000 --> 21:27.000]  The whole process of life is put into an artificial system, just like the Terminator seeds put out 30 years ago by Monsanto, their child's play today,
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  where the plants no longer produce seeds that continue the life cycle.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  You've got to get new seeds out of the laboratory.
[21:35.000 --> 21:41.000]  It is a total scientific, cold-blooded corporate takeover.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  And that's what all the transgenderism is.
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's what all the attack on the family is.
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  All of that is a takeover of civilization, a takeover of the life cycle.
[21:52.000 --> 22:04.000]  And the people that are into whatever the latest globalist fad is to push the agenda, they are victims of it.
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  So that when you criticize the system, they then personalize it and say, oh, look, you're attacking this poor individual.
[22:11.000 --> 22:25.000]  This is a codified, declassified, long-term strategic plan that you can read about in the 1920s being developed by the Royal Commission in England.
[22:25.000 --> 22:35.000]  And then being deployed by the UN by the 1960s in a global plan, we are living in this science fiction dystopic system.
[22:35.000 --> 22:45.000]  And humanity is trying to learn how this thing works, trying to struggle against it, pretty late in the game, but coming back late in the game.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  So I want to say something.
[22:47.000 --> 22:55.000]  I would obviously do some things differently in hindsight of how I said certain things or how I did certain things.
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.000]  But in the main, 95% of what I've done, I would do it all over again.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  I would endorse Donald Trump three years ago even stronger than I did.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  I would follow this course because I know we're changing history for the better.
[23:12.000 --> 23:24.000]  And I know we're standing up against really, really twisted, selfish, anti-human individuals that think they're playing God and who don't live by the same rules they want to foist upon us.
[23:24.000 --> 23:32.000]  And this is the epic battle for humanity taking place and transpiring right now.
[23:32.000 --> 23:46.000]  And no one else other than President Trump or maybe Iran Paul could tell you from the trenches and the experiences I've been in how this thing works.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  And I learn more exponentially every day.
[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  And I have no fear for myself or for infowars itself.
[23:54.000 --> 24:11.000]  I have true nauseating concern now that we haven't done a good enough job to wake people up because now I really know for sure my research and my fact-finding missions and all the interviews we did.
[24:11.000 --> 24:23.000]  And the facts that we just stalted together just got massive chills were totally that on except for we saw a mountain of evil and thought that was the evil.
[24:23.000 --> 24:31.000]  And then we scaled the peak and saw a mountain 10 times bigger and that this mountain was just the first wave.
[24:31.000 --> 24:41.000]  God, there may be something bigger on the other side of that, but God's going to lift us up for those challenges for each wave we go over and then see a bigger tsunami.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  This is the animating contest.
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  This is it.
[24:44.000 --> 24:54.000]  And I just hope folks out there can understand what we're facing and what we're dealing with because these are going to be the times that try men and women souls.
[24:54.000 --> 25:03.000]  And if you look at the public that are under leftist globalist corporate TV control, I mean TV is what's killing humanity.
[25:03.000 --> 25:11.000]  The shut-in society, the passivity, the sedentaryness, the brainwaves lowering.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  If you look at people that follow the system, they look like they're dead.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  They're not just physically in bad shape.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  They look shriveled.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Their eyes are dead.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  There's nothing there.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  It's beyond sleep.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  They are being put into a trance to then be psychically fed on.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  The whole Bible is real.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  It's interdimensional.
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  And this whole thing is anti-life, anti-human.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  The earth is in the process of being killed right now.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  And they know you at a spiritual and intellectual level and mathematical level know that's happening.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  So they go, oh, the earth's dying.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  We're the guardians of it.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Let's cut the carbon dioxide off.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  That's the key to the whole life cycle.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  And they could actually clean the planet if we could boost it like it was in previous ages.
[26:04.000 --> 26:11.000]  The one thing that could really clean the planet up, that is the regenerative system.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  It's not oxygen.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  It's carbon dioxide.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  And it's what's lowering really fast.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  The lowest level's ever recorded.
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  We compare the numbers last century to a million years ago, 10 million, 25 million.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  I mean, we're in a crisis and it's big.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  And the globalists are terraforming their geoengineering towards everything they say they're trying to stop.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  They're really pulled back from this.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  It's big.
[26:35.000 --> 26:43.000]  And they're so upset that a anti-Satanist, a pro-human, has gotten into the White House in the middle of their operation.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  They've got him walled off.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  He's only able to do limited things to prove he could turn the economy around.
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.000]  But if Trump could just get into the real shadow government, you would be blown away.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  So that's it.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  Everybody's being targeted by this.
[27:00.000 --> 27:09.000]  I don't care if you're black or white or old or young or, you know, you're a transsexual or whatever you are.
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  This whole delusion about be whatever you want in an imaginary world is because they want you to imagine imaginary rights.
[27:16.000 --> 27:24.000]  And they want you to think about crimes against humanity hundreds of years ago so that you don't recognize the crimes against humanity they're taking place now.
[27:24.000 --> 27:39.000]  This is how the evil attacks.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  It does it by stealth.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  It does it through the culture.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  It does it through the water, the food, the chemicals.
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  It does it through the whole program.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  And it gets a bunch of people full of anxiety, a bunch of people scared because at their human gut level they know humanity's in a crisis.
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  And then they misdirected at the surface level onto people that are trying to turn the ship around and fix things and say you're full of anxiety.
[27:59.000 --> 28:14.000]  You've got Trump derangement syndrome because of Trump and Alex Jones, not because the whole globalist system was designed to make you a failure and was designed to bring you down.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  So we have a lot of good things happening.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  We have a lot of bad things happening.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  And we're going to break it all down coming up today.
[28:20.000 --> 28:28.000]  But if you want to know why they're really mad at Info Wars, it's little things like the top of InfoWars.com, the front page.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  You can just click right there, save the Internet.
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  And it's the Adams Report on the shadow bank and everything we put out two weeks ago.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  And you notice Congress, literally no one had written a report.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  We got it to them.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  You got it to them.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  You did that.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  That's one example of just standing up a little bit brings victory.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  They want you to moralize in a trance, not believing you can have any victory.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  Well, we know there's victory.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  And we know there's victory if you simply stand up and are conscious.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  We're trying to get people to come out of the trance.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  Come out of the trance.
[28:58.000 --> 29:27.000]  Wake up.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  We got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church.
[29:53.000 --> 29:58.000]  Get them right now at killingunclesambook.com.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  You are the info war.
[30:26.000 --> 30:35.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.

[33:24.000 --> 33:32.000]  All right, we've got incredible news on the ongoing moves to impeach Rosenstein in Congress.
[33:32.000 --> 33:41.000]  We've got Trump, you guys reprinted me his tweet please coming out last week saying that shadow batting is illegal, they're looking into it, there's new developments on that front.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  Economist, very respected economist as CNN is fueling a civil war.
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  They're calling for that. It's all coming up.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  There's so much I'm going to be getting to here today.
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.000]  And then we're also going to have an expert on how the globalists are funding radical jihad generation.
[34:05.000 --> 34:12.000]  Got a bunch of videos of imams up on infowars.com calling for a new invasion of Europe.
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  Well, it's already happened under the EU.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  It's incredible that that footage is coming up as well.
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.000]  Also, Michael Snyder article that's up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  Ten signs that America is in much worse trouble than we thought.
[34:30.000 --> 34:37.000]  And Trump knows that and desperately trying to fix things, but let me just say this briefly before I get into the rest of the news.
[34:37.000 --> 34:46.000]  When I say I would have been even more pro-Trump if I knew all this was going to happen despite the fact that I've been incredibly censored and attacked and persecuted.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  It's because it's the proof of how good Trump is.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  It isn't some sick relationship where I just support the president no matter what.
[34:55.000 --> 35:06.000]  It's that I've been persecuted and lied about just like he has and I've experienced next level lies and next level demonization.
[35:06.000 --> 35:14.000]  And it's incredible.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  And there's many examples of this, but here's one that's back in the news this weekend.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  I saw it all over the news, not even looking.
[35:21.000 --> 35:43.000]  I mean, CNN, MSNBC, every hour, just thousands of articles just saying Jones has been blocked on YouTube and on Facebook for bullying a child and child endangerment.
[35:43.000 --> 35:51.000]  To the point I've had multiple members of my family call me the last five, six days and say, Alex, it's weird. They say you bullied a child and child endangerment.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  They don't say any details.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  Usually there's a police reporter.
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  They say, you know, at this and I go, I know, oh, you picked that up.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  They go, yeah, is that fake news?
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  And I go, yeah, it's totally fake.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  We linked a month ago or a month and a half ago to an ABC news story.
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.000]  In another state, some kid, it's an eight minute video, some 11 year old, they said was punching adults in the face.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  And finally he punches one adult in the face.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  Four times the adult pushes him down.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  We covered that over a month and a half ago, like everybody else did.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  So we know the flag video it is.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Well, we have the upload date and we have it on our computers.
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.000]  We went and looked and we're like, whoa, then they did another child endangerment and it's Muslims pushing a kid on the railroad tracks.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  But the kid doesn't get run over and that had been even on CNN.
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  And then they said, oh, well, you made fun of and you bullied transsexuals.
[36:42.000 --> 36:51.000]  And that footage is what they called a drag queen festival in Austin with young and we won't show you the footage or we'll be totally banned.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  But see, that's how they're already winning.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  So I'm getting the point.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  I'm going to have to go ahead and show the footage and then do the lawsuits.
[36:56.000 --> 37:04.000]  And it's little kids, two year olds putting money in the G string of big fat men with purple wigs shaking their butts and children's faces.
[37:04.000 --> 37:18.000]  I don't care if it's a drag queen, a guy, a woman, a baboon, you know, anything or anybody shaking their butt in a kid's face, pole dancing when a kid puts money in their G string.
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  It's sexualization of children.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  So that's what's going on here.
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  But what's crazy is they won't show you in the thousands of articles what I said or did.
[37:33.000 --> 37:43.000]  And then they began to say things in Forbes and in local TV stations, you name it.
[37:43.000 --> 38:04.000]  They should begin to show headlines that said that I had threatened David Hogg, the anti gun crusader to poison his water.
[38:04.000 --> 38:13.000]  Now David Hogg went on C span and said I'm a con man because I sell water filters and that isn't it strange.
[38:13.000 --> 38:21.000]  He said, Jones says there's a lot of poison in the water and then he has an ad for water filters as if that's some oblique deception or some secret sales job.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  No, it's called straight up straight shooting.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  That's my tactic.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  The truth.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  Hey, there's hundreds of chemicals in the average water table.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  The biggest thing you do for you and your families get high quality gravity fed water filters.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  We spell sell a spectrum of five different companies that have the best testing out there.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  Some are better at this or better at that and then for store.com.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  It's totally hey, there's poison in the water in most areas.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  There's glyphosates.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  You name it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  You need to filter.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  So I said, dude, you need to filter your water.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  I care about you.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  He said that on C span.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  I responded.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  I learned.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  I didn't even know this till we went into our Facebook records.
[38:59.000 --> 39:07.000]  A few months ago, they took a video down for threats saying that it was improper to tell
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  David Hogg he should filter his water.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  You talk about comical with the SJW is that they've hired at Facebook and YouTube that
[39:15.000 --> 39:25.000]  he attacks me as a con man on C span says I'm an effing con man on his Twitter.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  I say, I care about you.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  Please come on and have a debate.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  I believe kids died.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  I never said they didn't.
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  That's a media lie.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  And by the way, you really should filter your water.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  There's a lot of chemicals and they goes, oh my God, you just threatened me.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  And it's all over the news.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Did Jones threaten him saying filter your water?
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  This is the mental gymnastics and weirdness that they're using to control all speech and
[39:47.000 --> 39:56.000]  kill speech in this country.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  It's even in a TRO filing to take my kids away at the Travis County courthouse right now
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  because the left fell to that before saying Jones threatened David Hogg and then they
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  use a news headline like that makes it true.
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  And then Jones endangered children doesn't say who just YouTube said.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  See, it's like, well, David Hogg said or YouTube's like, well, God, then that's it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  We don't, we don't show who said it.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  We don't show the proof.
[40:23.000 --> 40:31.000]  We just say Jones threatened David Hogg.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  Jones did this.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  Jones did that.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  I mean, here's the deal.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  I used to think the level of this lying would discredit them.
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  No, no, because they've got followers that don't care and who just want to pick up the
[40:49.000 --> 40:57.000]  lie and go with it even though they know it's not true.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  And that's the next level in this country.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  It's delusion and almost all the people involved in it.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  I've noticed don't have jobs.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  They're spoiled.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  They're very young.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  It's fantasy land.
[41:09.000 --> 41:18.000]  This is mass insanity is what this is because again, everybody knows if you saw a headline
[41:18.000 --> 41:25.000]  Mr. John Doe 47 shot his wife, hypothetically dead.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  So police arrested him.
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  He used to be in a rain this morning and indicted by the grand jury this week.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  You would hear who his wife's name was, the address of where it happened.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  You know, you could go to the court and see him being arraigned with me.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  They just go, did you hear Jones was taken off the internet?
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  He beat up a little kid.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  We're not going to say where or when just he did.
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.000]  And then he wanted to poison David Hogg and then he bullied some other kids and that's
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  all they do.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  That's all the left does.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  You know, when they're not signing 400,000 signatures to rehire James Gunn who says he
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  loves pedophiles and pedophilia.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  You know, when they're not saying, we want you to abort your kids.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  We want suicide.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  We want death.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  There's too many people, but oh, we love children.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  Trump is arresting innocent children in mass.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  Meanwhile, I saw the CNN headline.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  Why are there 700 kids still not giving their parents how Trump screwed everything up?
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  And then they admit the article.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  Well, these kids don't have parents.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  They came across without parents and the little girl they claim was taken from her mom never
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  was.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  And it's just how they set things up for failure.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  It's all lies.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  And because the public's so dumb and just watch TV all day.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  They just believe it because it's just what they take on.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  And it's a war between all these dumb down people and then people that are actually informed.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  And it's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[42:53.000 --> 43:21.000]  There's never been lying like this.
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[43:28.000 --> 43:37.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[43:37.000 --> 43:58.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[43:58.000 --> 44:06.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[44:06.000 --> 44:16.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[44:16.000 --> 44:26.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[44:26.000 --> 44:54.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[44:54.000 --> 45:16.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[45:16.000 --> 45:38.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.
[45:38.000 --> 46:00.000]  It's just crazy to watch the level of the lies.

[46:56.000 --> 47:22.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.000]  Raw and Unfiltered. It's The Alex Jones Show.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  So the point I was getting at is something the audience understands, but it's not just rhetorical.
[47:35.000 --> 47:48.000]  The mainstream corporate media are absolute mercenary trash who also hate the country and enjoy what they're doing and have absolutely no morals
[47:48.000 --> 48:05.000]  and literally have been hired because their profiles, their algorithm, their psychological signature, their profile assessment is that they are psychotics, or at least sociopaths.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  And then you realize they have built an army of these people and put them in charge.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  And their whole religion is dominating good men and women.
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  Then you're like, my God, all we've got to fight these people. Exactly. You can't spend money with them. You can't support them. You can't be around them.
[48:21.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's total war. Those of us that are nice, gregarious, sweet people have to understand that we are under attack because we're seen as food.
[48:31.000 --> 48:46.000]  When they can have no exaggeration, because Google has filters, but I get the alerts and I can set them where I mean every TV station, that's a big establishment syndication TV station.
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.000]  I'm going to play a clip to show you this in a minute. Put out hit pieces against me telling a bunch of lies the last week.
[48:53.000 --> 49:00.000]  And they get the download, they get the script, they read it locally, they put it out because they know that locally it has more credibility with people.
[49:00.000 --> 49:07.000]  And again, why would they do that? Because the Communist Chinese own Hollywood. They own our debt. They work with the Democrats.
[49:07.000 --> 49:16.000]  They almost have the country defeated. We are literally saying America is run by foreign globalist powers. They want to make you poor. They want to destroy you.
[49:16.000 --> 49:23.000]  Watch what Trump does if he gets in. Everything will turn around. He barely gets a little bit of control. Everything turns around. They're panicking even more.
[49:23.000 --> 49:32.000]  We are fighting globalist foreign powers. We are fighting enemies of you and your family.
[49:32.000 --> 49:42.000]  And Trump comes out and says, when you're watching mainstream media, don't believe anything they tell you. They go, oh, that's Orwell.
[49:42.000 --> 49:54.000]  Don't believe the media. No, Orwell wrote about himself running OSS operations at the BBC in World War II as Winston Smith in the media, the Ministry of Truth.
[49:54.000 --> 50:05.000]  He said, don't believe the media. What Trump said was absolutely in line with what Orwell said, the opposite of Orwellian.
[50:05.000 --> 50:15.000]  But they put out the talking point that he was Orwellian saying, don't trust the media. Well, let me tell you, I've learned to not trust the media.
[50:15.000 --> 50:31.000]  And the unified discipline. We had an article on Wednesday. I never played the video. It was a boil down of dozens of TV stations saying Trump's Orwellian, Trump's a liar, 1984.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.000]  And then of course, Dan Rather and others came out and repeated it as well.
[50:37.000 --> 50:49.000]  But that's the discipline, the discipline to have over 10,000 news articles, every major paper in the US, all the major British papers, French newspapers, Japanese newspapers.
[50:49.000 --> 51:02.000]  When I say 10,000, that's low balling in. Say that I was kicked off the internet for bullying a child and pushing a child to the ground and they're not saying where it happened.
[51:02.000 --> 51:10.000]  The police report, none of it. That exercise in criminal activity.
[51:10.000 --> 51:23.000]  As Trump says, when big media organizes against you to say you've committed crimes, and it's not true, and then they don't even show the proof, I mean, folks, that's beyond the Ministry of Truth and Winston Smith.
[51:23.000 --> 51:31.000]  Because Winston would try to figure out how to write a lie that made sense. These don't even make sense.
[51:31.000 --> 51:46.000]  And then I started seeing Jones threatened David Hogg. No clip, no nothing. A few would make vague reference. Jones threatened to poison his water.
[51:46.000 --> 51:56.000]  No Hogg went on C-span. Can we pull that up? A short notice of David Hogg talks about what Alex Jones gave frogs and water filters.
[51:56.000 --> 52:04.000]  And I say, dude, there's chemicals in the water. Okay, if you want to be anti-gun fine, but admit people should filter water. It's not a scam to try to get water filters.
[52:04.000 --> 52:17.000]  And that turns into Jones threatened Hogg. I mean, because he's a god, see, he's a public figure. He's going to go out and blame all gun owners and say the NRA is run by Russia last week.
[52:17.000 --> 52:29.000]  And then they're going to say that I said nobody died and that he's an actor, a crisis actor when I never said that. I said he's in the drama club of four kids out of 3,000 chosen because he's anti-gun, which is true.
[52:29.000 --> 52:38.000]  And their response was, take Alex Jones off YouTube and Facebook. And YouTube and Facebook put fake strikes on me, had to remove him because I got lawyers involved.
[52:38.000 --> 52:49.000]  We had the videos. I didn't say that. But they're back. See, I'm going to cover this after I go to your calls and cover a bunch of news the next hour.
[52:49.000 --> 52:56.000]  You saw thousands of articles. They just printed a bunch of them for me earlier. The whole drag queen articles. Got those?
[52:56.000 --> 53:08.000]  Where they had the drag queen protest of Trump with the little inflatable doll baby Trump. We ran that headline and they said, you're not allowed to even say that word now.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  But I have hundreds of news articles out of Newsweek. You name it.
[53:11.000 --> 53:28.000]  Saying Donald Trump will be met with mass drag queen protest. We run a headline with the same thing. And they say saying that word isn't allowed. We're going to ban you if you say it again. And they took our video down covering London protest.
[53:28.000 --> 53:46.000]  By the way, the Newsweek article says a bunch of stuff I wouldn't even say that I think is derogatory. That's Newsweek. But see, they'll probably strike me saying I said something evil. Newsweek can two plus two equals four when they say, when they don't say it equals four, then you can't say it.
[53:46.000 --> 54:02.000]  So this is the total all out assault. And later I'll cover that. We're going to break it all down.
[54:02.000 --> 54:20.000]  Coming up in the next hour, just just briefly here as you all know, we're listeners supported. And without you, the globalists are going to win. I mean, hell, you can see them all over every TV station, every radio station in the country saying shut Alex Jones up, get him off the air.
[54:20.000 --> 54:31.000]  Don't let him speak. Don't let him have his speech. He needs to be destroyed. He beat up little kids, but they don't show you where I mean these people think they run the country and run you and they're pissed that America's coming back.
[54:31.000 --> 54:40.000]  And they don't know what to do. So we're running a special where you can get our three super high quality.
[54:40.000 --> 54:51.000]  Fish oil products krill oil fish oil while harvested and then honor roll. It's great for kids college students you name it with all the known oils for for for your brain your body everything no reviews yet because it just came out.
[54:51.000 --> 55:06.000]  Other products have 10,000 plus reviews five star reviews, average of 4.8 reviews unprecedented. The third party sites. We have it all at info war store.com and info wars life.com.
[55:06.000 --> 55:16.000]  And these are products you already need. They're already super high quality. It funds our operation. A total win win. Everybody needs to commit to go get the products on a for auto ship that additional 10% off.
[55:16.000 --> 55:28.000]  I mean, let me just show you this. We can do a camera shot right here. This is honor roll because I give my children fish oil every day. They love it. It's really good for them.
[55:28.000 --> 55:42.000]  And this this this is even better than the mainline stuff that's in store. So now I'm giving them my product and it's got a special proprietary system that extracts the the mercury, which a lot of other fish oils and things still have some in this brings it down to non detectable
[55:42.000 --> 55:59.000]  levels. So honor roll. And it's got everything in it. Right there ladies and gentlemen, it's got the omega three fatty acids, the DHA, the EPA, the vitamin D, the vitamin E, all of it for total absorption, everything their brain needs.
[55:59.000 --> 56:11.000]  This this is just amazing. Do your own research into what fish oil does for the heart, the brain, the body honor rolls targeted for the brain. Let me just show you again, just the color of these babies.
[56:11.000 --> 56:23.000]  Back out a little bit here. There you go. Just just just look at the color of those. I know that translates over the internet. But but let me tell you right now. I mean that right and by the way, it's a two month supply in each bottle.
[56:23.000 --> 56:35.000]  So the price is the regular price of leading competitors, but twice as much in it. And I can be down. I can be tired. I can be whatever. But I take some of these bad boys. This brain formula for kids. If I take it for myself.
[56:35.000 --> 56:43.000]  We have one of the bigger capitals for adults coming out soon. And it's just incredible. A breakfast at dinner, you name it, the dreams I have.
[56:43.000 --> 56:53.000]  Fish oil is well known associated with all of that in four store dot com in fours life dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine.

[57:01.000 --> 57:09.000]  It's for heart and body, not just brain. It's for all of it. And then we've got the ultimate fish oil that's wild harvested in the North Atlantic.

[57:28.000 --> 57:38.000]  There's a lot of great fish oils out there, but a lot of them don't do the expense of one of the whole extraction process to get the mercury out of it.
[57:38.000 --> 57:45.000]  So again, this is there at info or store dot com in fours life dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine.

[58:32.000 --> 58:41.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.

[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us praying for us and spreading the word.
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  You are the info war.
[59:17.000 --> 59:26.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to info wars dot com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[59:26.000 --> 59:32.000]  No way the sensors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, Intel, you name it.
[59:32.000 --> 59:40.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the info wars dot com articles to share the videos to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[59:40.000 --> 59:47.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at info wars dot com forward slash newsletter.
[59:47.000 --> 59:53.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  We are only on periscope on Twitter right now.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  We've been banned off Facebook and YouTube live streaming.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  And I'm sure it'll be periscope the next few days.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  And that's because the establishment is making its move against free speech here in America.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  They've already done it in communist China.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  They've already done it in Europe.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  They admit they're now doing it here.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Now, why is this the most banned information in the world?
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  If you type in Alex Jones into Google or Bing today, there are over 10,000 articles in the last couple days lying about what I've said and what I've done.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  And they're never showing you in the articles what I said or what I did.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  That is one on one violation of journalism because these aren't journalists.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  These are killers of free speech.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  These are corporate mercenaries making their move ahead of the 2018 midterms.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  What is the radical information that we're covering here?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  What is it?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  It's that the Chinese communist and big banks along with Hollywood took the U.S. over and we're running it into the ground by design.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  And then the dark horse candidate Donald Trump got elected and began to reverse it in the last year and a half.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  And they're now panicking because prosperity is coming back in.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  And so they have engaged in a massive shadow ban, a blocking of Christians, libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, the president in the last year and a half.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  They've dialed the president back over 90%.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  There's major analytic sites that track it where people subscribe to his Twitter.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  They don't get the information.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  But now they're pushing it up to 97% against myself, Paul Watson and others at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  And yeah, the other so-called conservatives thought, well, that's just them being censored.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  It's not us.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  Now they're all being censored.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Members of Congress are being blocked.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  They're not able to even have their speeches on C-SPAN on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  There is a massive assault going on against the First Amendment ahead of the midterms and the media is trying to set the president lying about info wars,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  misrepresenting what we've done, never showing what we supposedly said to shut us down to set the president against everyone.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  So the most censored thing in the world isn't devil worship or pornography or people being tortured or Islamists being brought in to do all this stuff.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  No, it's me pointing out and raising the alarm as a modern Paul Revere that this draconian censorship and control is here.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Go see the videos that they've taken us off Facebook and YouTube for.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Go see them.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  They say I beat up a kid.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I showed ABC News footage of some punk kid attacking an adult and the guy pushes him down.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  It's all over the news.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I covered it.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Go show my Islamophobia, which is some leftist college term, it's anti-free speech, where I show Islamists is pouring across the border in Europe.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Go see the videos they don't want you to see.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  They want to lie to you about those videos.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Misrepresent and then set the president to shut it all down.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  This is happening right now because they know America is waking up.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  They know the world is waking up.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  They know you're waking up.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  And they've been censoring and they've been controlling and they've been bullying and they weren't even looking for you to stop.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Posting, they were looking for you to join them in a Pavlovian carrot versus the stick equation to start putting out globalist propaganda because you were not getting promoted on their platforms.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  But you didn't do that.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  You didn't sell out like the average daily beast writer or even Wall Street Journal writer or others did that pair at the line.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  They're like, aren't you like us?
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  I mean, we've been blocking you on Facebook and Twitter pages.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  You promoted.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  We've been not letting you talk to conservatives for years.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  We've been shadow banning you.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  And now you are not giving in.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  Well, we're just going to ban you outright.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  They go, oh, 90 days on YouTube for the election, 30 days on Facebook.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And they sit back on the act like, oh, will he do it again?
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  Will he beat up a baby again?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  They don't show me beating the baby up.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Telltale sign.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  They just say, well, when they finally banned me completely, they'll go, he got warned a lot.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  And I was like, yeah, we saw all of the news.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  We never saw what he said.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  We never saw what he did.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  I want to play into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com. I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  That's infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139. And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide. I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  The left, the globalists, the big corporations backed up by Communist China are really upset.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  America is coming back. They're panicking. They don't know what to do.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  And so they are launching massive censorship campaigns where they don't just ban people off Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  They then lie about why they took you off and don't show why they did it.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  That's the absolute 101 journalism red flag. And so they are bullying the American people.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  They are bullying Christians. They are bullying conservatives.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  They're nudging us like the big liberal foundations talked about.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  They are teaching us how to submit.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  And so I want to ask listeners, where do you think this is going?
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  What do you think the president needs to do?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Specifically, opening the phones up about conservatives, about libertarians, about Christians, and others who have been censored, who have been blocked, who have been persecuted.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  I mean, I was just search engineing this during the break.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  They're not just saying, don't say the name mother and father in public schools in Europe and the U.S. and Canada.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  They're now saying, they're telling preschoolers and first graders, don't say best because that'll hurt somebody's feelings.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  This is political correctness. This is total psychological warfare meant to create jellyfish basket cases.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  It's beyond giving everybody a trophy. It's now, don't say somebody's the best.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Schools banned from using the terms mom and dad as boys told to dress up as girls in non-gender specific free play.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  See, oh, the school's going to have you dressed up as a girl.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  We're going to sexually direct you. That's the daily mail.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  And if you criticize it, we're going to take your kids away from you.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  How'd you ever think they'd get our kids? That's how they're doing it right there.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  And they're making their move right now.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Meanwhile, the very same crazy leftist are allied with radical imams.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  You've got 10 million military aged men brought in the last five years to Europe.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  You've got the admission now that, oh, we do want to repopulate Europe with Islamist.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  And you've got people being arrested that criticized or even report on the crime that's taking place.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  What a time to be alive. And then the president tries to reverse that, tries to stand up against it so he gets demonized
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  and lied about. And again, I saw a CNN article this weekend going,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Trump hasn't implemented the judge's order to reunite all children with their parents
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  because most children don't have parents with them.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  And again, that predates, that's an Obama policy.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  And it predates, and the little girl in the famous photo,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  that they photoshopped the Trump with the girl, was with her mother, never taken away, but it doesn't matter.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  It's a triumph of fraud.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  So watch the articles up on infowars.com.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I'm going to play it and read the subtitles.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Copenhagen, imam, jihad necessity for the Muslim invasion and conquest of Europe.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  And again, when I read this, this is the imams words.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  And this is the standard thought process.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Imram Mardahar Abdullah of the Al Fark Mas in Copenhagen told his followers,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  the final solution, that's a Nazi term by the way,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  to the problem of the Levant, that's the big Islamic land,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  after the establishment of the Caliphate and the elimination of the Jewish entity will be through the conquest of Europe.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Abdullah was speaking on a video shot last year.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Now, no, no, here's the issue.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  Europe was invaded over 100 times by the Muslims.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  Turkey was Constantinople.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Now it is Istanbul, the great blue mosque.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Oh, look at the, it was Christian belt.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  That's a fact, but they teach in schools that the Crusades invaded.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  Well, I guess kind of like Hitler attacked us and we invaded Germany.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  I mean, I guess we did invade Germany, but he attacked first.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  We did invade the Pacific.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  We did go after Japan, but they attacked first.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  So, I mean, I guess technically the Crusades did invade the Middle East after 100 plus invasions
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  and they pushed all the way almost through Poland, Czechoslovakia into Germany.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  And people went, you know, this is getting out of hand here.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  And then it took 200 years to kick them out of Spain and kick them out of Eastern Europe.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  It was called the Reconquest or the Reconquista.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Why is it called a reconquista?
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Because you were conquered. See, and then you reconquer.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  So you get invaded and you take it back. It's a Reconquista, see.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  So that's what's so insane about all this is they teach in schools.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  When I was in school that America's bad, America's evil, and the Christians are bad
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  and they hurt the portal Muslims and invaded the portal Muslims who were so peaceful.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  I mean, Muhammad was running slaves all over North Africa.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  His people were after him.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  You know, all of the little kids, sex, slavery, I mean, all of it is in there.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And you're not supposed to say that. That's historical facts.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And so all the EU censorship, all the control, it's now coming here.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  So let's go ahead and start getting in to one of the main imams in Copenhagen
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  with the general public in their Stockholm syndrome. Here it is.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  So the final solution, the problem of Levant, after the establishment of the Caliphate
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  and the elimination of the Jewish entity, we will through the conquest of Europe,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  the Mediterranean Sea in its entirety with all its shores and coasts,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  must become purely Islamic. Hit pause.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Oh, you're not going to get to be Christian once you conquer like everywhere else?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Oh, oh, it must be purely is 100 percent.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  But I thought it was the religion of peace.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  I mean, gay people are married by the Islamic system in there.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  They're not thrown off buildings. I mean, oh, but I need to be censored.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  I understand. I was homophobic. I understand.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Here, let's just continue. He goes on to say that no judgment day until Muslims slay the Jews.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  But that's Danish imam. This guy says similar stuff.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  But you know what? I'm sorry. This is cultural enrichment.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  So I should apologize. The imam's right. I'm a bad person here. Here you go.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Thus fulfilling the promise of the Prophet Muhammad about the conquest of Rome,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  the Muslims almost took three times. Europe must be invaded again.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  History must repeat itself.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Pause. They taught me in high school and college. We invaded them.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Wait, wait. This guy says the Muslims invaded us. Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  This is incredible. Of course, it's true. Europe must be invaded again.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  History must repeat itself. Oh, OK. Go ahead.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  We must have a new Tariq, and we will sail the seas across the strait of Gibraltar.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Oh, in Spain again. And we will liberate Ali Andalus, restoring it to the bosom of Islam.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  That's Spain. This is back it up to the bosom.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  Everybody's trying to flee the bosom of Islam. Everybody's like, get me out of here. God, it's out on Earth.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  Help me, man. Meanwhile, you want to restore it to your bosom.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  I think you can. I don't want to be in your bosom, buddy.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  I don't want to be your bosom, bud. How's that sound?
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  I'm not cutting women's genitals off, and I'm not throwing gays off buildings.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  I know I'm the bad guy. I understand.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  And we will liberate restoring it to the bosom of Islam.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Can we look up Al-Andalus? I think that's southern Spain.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  And I know they took over Sicily and everywhere in hell. They pushed all the way to Rome three times.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  The Vatican had 200-foot walls and hauled them back.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  But the Vatican today says, open up everything and pull down your walls, but we're going to keep ours.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  We'll come back with one of the main imams there in Copenhagen, Denmark, and they got them in Sweden, got them everywhere, saying the same stuff.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  And we'll play it all.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  This is Jessica Arman, founder of My Magic Mud.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Our team helped organize a successful effort to remove fluoride from our city's water supply.

[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  It's all amazing.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Thank you, brother.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.840]  must conquer all of Europe we tried before this time we will succeed here it
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:15.680]  is we must have new Ottomans who will enter the Balkans and restore them to
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.160]  the bosom of Islam it pause because you did add over a hundred invasions there
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:26.360]  and got kicked out a couple times so just like Albania was with the
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.760]  Clintons and that was allowed to take over a third of Serbia even though they
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.160]  admit that the Muslims started the war the service of the bad guys we heard that
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:40.240]  on the news and then so here he is continue we must have a proud and
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:49.560]  pious army of believers who will march from North Africa and conquer Rome
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:26:03.800]  Allah willing that's we will be fulfilling our religious duty to jihad for
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:13.120]  the sake of Allah they can put the jibs on all the women to in order to
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.440]  glorify his word to elevate his banner and to institute his law throughout the
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:26.040]  world jihad use jihad necessitates the conquest of Europe jihad necessitates
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.600]  the conquest of Europe the Quran says fight them until back it up he's talked
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:37.120]  too fast fight them until let's have this loving religion apiece fight them
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:45.160]  until there is no more fitna look up fitna in Arabic for me and what was the
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:50.640]  other term so so no more fitness search engine fitna for me let's just before we
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:58.000]  go back let's just definition fitna in Islam we'll come back to that in a
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:06.240]  moment let's continue a religion belongs to Allah alone hit pause wait wait wait

[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:24.480]  temptation means peace it's all everyone submits so there is there was no
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.440]  more resistance fitna's resistance okay that's what we thought okay let's go
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:43.160]  back it's impossible to eliminate fitna once the capitalist and the secular
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:48.040]  order is destroyed eliminated ah I gotta get rid of that capitalism of course
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.760]  you'll be in a big palace the emulation of the resistance will not occur solely
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:28:00.880]  they're calling upon Europeans to join Islam oh European media the European
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.360]  order and the European practices lured not just the infidels but the Muslims
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.600]  themselves away from Islam exactly you got to burn that down the Western
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.360]  media and politics do not merely keep Europeans away from Islam but strive to
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.360]  rip the Muslims and Europe away from Islam it possible so of course the

[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:52.140]  by the way I've been talking about this imam who is not Danish as they say he's a
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:59.620]  he's an invader into Denmark and we've got other people in Stockholm Sweden we've
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:05.180]  got folks in in other areas saying invade Europe takeover get rid of the
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:11.140]  infidels this is the standard procedure that's what the UN and Hollywood and all
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:16.540]  the media are pushing is an Islamic takeover of the West and so here's this
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:23.260]  imam breaking down the whole invasion they want what they're gonna do now
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:26.100]  they're not gonna have a melting pot with the West they're gonna conquer and
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:36.340]  make everyone convert to Islam which is the orthodoxy of Islam stories up on
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:40.740]  info wars.com I have another article the whole other video of him watch no
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:45.580]  judgment day until Muslims slay the Jews now CNN will probably clip that out and
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.500]  say that I said that that's a whole other subject do you realize they're on
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:37:01.420]  the news now saying that I am calling for the poisoning of David Hogg by the way
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:05.500]  we never played the David Hogg thing I know you found it but I mentioned it and
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.980]  I never got to it I mean ladies and gentlemen and when they say that they
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:16.460]  don't show David Hogg saying I'm a bad guy that I saw water filters and I say
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:24.140]  David Hogg you really should be drinking filtered water I mean that's what I'm
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:27.540]  saying the level of the left how they play like their victims when they're
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:33.940]  actually bullies is insane and they're all these public figures and then they
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:40.820]  have a self-described drag queen transsexual then they use Q word that if
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.460]  I use it they'd say I was being hateful and that's in Barry Diller's Newsweek
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:49.700]  everywhere we report on it and then they say oh another strike on your Facebook
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.020]  we're taking that video down because someone was offended by you saying hey
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:38:00.940]  this big drag queen festival hating Trump is ridiculous so that criticize you
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:05.340]  being political you get to be political I can't say this is ridiculous and then
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.460]  it was a drag queen protest because saying it's a drag queen protest is
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:13.020]  hateful because that's the new protected group not just the n-word but the t-word
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:18.380]  the d-word the q-word and then anything they say or do you can't even oppose them
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:22.660]  politically and say I don't agree with what you're doing in my life because
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:28.260]  they're the protected group I mean it's just unbelievable and Congress needs to
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:34.860]  act because the insanity of the universities the insanity of the big
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:39.220]  corporations and their corporate cultures of control is spilling out the
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:46.060]  insanity of Los Angeles it's getting crazy I scratched my eye today and then
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:48.820]  I got in the lake and it got infected and I think I left my sunglasses in my
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:53.260]  office somebody bring those to me thanks I'm gonna put those back on cuz under
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:59.500]  the lights doesn't feel well that's why I was wearing glasses earlier and that's
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.940]  what's going on with that and we'll go to your phone calls next segment but
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:10.140]  right now let's go ahead and finish up with the imam here it is the melting
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:13.860]  pot policies which target Islamic identity and the media which distorts the
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:17.140]  image of Islam portraying his terrorism extremism and all sorts of vile
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:21.780]  descriptions and pause again he says we're going to conquer Europe take it
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.780]  over and not let you only be Muslim but now it's vile the fenta the resistance
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:37.280]  and corruption can only be eliminated oh keep going by destroying the
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.180]  capitalist and secular order and replacing it with an Islamic order it
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:45.820]  possible but the secular order is threatened by Christianity so it's
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:51.380]  bringing this in because it has a fetish to hate Christianity they go on to say
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:57.620]  we must eradicate it or through expansion of the Islamic order continue
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:05.500]  you know up to the heart of Europe the land back up again the land
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:13.380]  but of the crusaders so you invaded Europe over and over again took a lot
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:18.460]  of Europe sold the woman into sex slavery you know did your stuff turkey all
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:23.260]  of it run your harems and you're pissed that you didn't get it all but now

[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:29.300]  you bought off in Europe and you're sitting there on your fat ass on
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:33.700]  welfare like 80% of the Muslims in Europe and you see a bunch of weak
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:39.380]  people and you're gonna take them your lucky crusaders on around buddy boy go
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:50.500]  back to him in Vader back it up invading the strongholds of their
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.100]  secular civilization well you've done that continue
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:06.140]  that's the limiting ones in her all the danger facing the Levant or the Islamic
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:10.660]  world government which is all they do and say I mean I could play these tapes
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:14.580]  every day of other prominent emoms I'm not saying hey let's invade them hey
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:18.860]  let's enslave them I knew that those invasions were about to be stabilizing
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:24.380]  and putting even worse globalist Muslims in to then invade us and the big
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.340]  corporate folks think they're gonna control all this they're gonna let the
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:31.100]  Muslim stuff get out of control and they're gonna release a bio weapon and
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:37.420]  that's the whole plan and if I was a coward I'd already be dug in owning a
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:48.900]  coffee farm in like Tasmania and changing my name I seriously if I if I
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:55.300]  was just a cold-blooded person I'd be gone just I've been gone years ago we

[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:28.300]  the devil went down to Georgia he was looking for a soul to steal he was in a
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:34.860]  bank was way behind I want to explain something I am not a tribalist person
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:40.700]  when it comes to what color you are or even your sexual persuasion I think a
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:44.340]  lot of that sexual stuff if you're an adult can be very destructive but I
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:49.860]  don't judge those people whatever they're into God knows I've been a wild man
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:55.100]  myself so I'm not throwing stones here let he without sin cast first stone but
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:48:04.060]  it doesn't mean that I don't know how stuff works and Islam is satanic by
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:07.940]  every stretched the imagination it came out of nowhere it was based on the
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:12.500]  slave trade at Medina it invaded the planet and now the evil forces of
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:22.140]  globalism are allied with it and that's the Al Qaeda flag by the way right there
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:35.860]  being taught in Europe and in in Danish households and I could see the whole
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:41.420]  globalist plan they admit their plan and the fact that YouTube Google Facebook
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:48.660]  Twitter are blocking me and I've been told you leave transsexualism alone and
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:53.580]  you leave Islam alone and you'll be able to operate however you want I was
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:49:00.020]  told in off-record meetings what do you want off-record and reason people have
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:03.820]  off-record meetings with me is unless it's illegal it's off-record and I was
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:09.180]  told by the New York Times who shed an emissary other senior people I was told
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:17.980]  the London Guardian I was told by National Democrat lawyer and then I was
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:23.060]  told by other Democrat lawyers and I was given messages directly from Soros a
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:30.940]  year ago and they said this is your last chance you stop what you're doing or
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:36.180]  we're gonna destroy you and I said what are you gonna do they said it'll all
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:39.620]  be through the legal system but you know we can do I said I know what you can
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:45.060]  do what do you want they said off-record off-record who said it I said yeah it's
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:49.500]  off-record I've been given the message even more than that now Islam's good
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:54.100]  accept it being brought in the integration of Islam with the West and
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:50:05.140]  do not talk about transsexuals and I meant and I expanded on that I go you
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:11.820]  mean you mean just period they go well the whole thing which is the sexualization
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.220]  of children because if you can't even say the word only they can't it's like
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:19.540]  the n-word the media takes it where that only black people can say it which I
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:23.380]  don't want to say it fine but then it becomes this power word well now you
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:28.540]  can't say Google Twitter Facebook all call us last year we recorded some of
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.700]  the phone calls for lawsuits we even you know told them they're on record they
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.820]  couldn't believe it we're like yeah we're recording you and they're like you
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:38.940]  cannot but everybody else can say it Barry Diller can say it news we can say
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:44.060]  it and CNN can say it and everybody else can say it talk about a new class
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.380]  system but I can't say it so they said don't use the t-word use transsexual and
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:56.180]  I said just as a test I'll do that they banned those videos too imagine that
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:59.820]  cult power has nothing to do with the transsexuals they're just a group they're
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:04.620]  using to say you can't talk about it I got a whole stack of news articles right
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:10.260]  here dozens of them from just people protesting Trump drag Queens trans and
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:14.060]  queer people protest Trump in London true media group liberal group the
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:19.500]  document cam shot place for TV viewers right over here yeah just zoom in right
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:24.540]  over here for me this is the document cam quadrant right here show they can
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:30.580]  say that but our very video with almost the exact same headline banned
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:38.820]  yesterday for the name look you've got this Austin group they call themselves
[01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:43.060]  training that's a group they came up with even if I say I don't hate these
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:47.700]  people and I don't doesn't matter it is chosen by the community like out of
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:52.900]  Kafka S1984 that we feel offended by you using it like the n-word so you can't
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:57.140]  and then the next word is father mother or best or winner those words are all
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:02.780]  being banned this is a takeover of language preschoolers discourage
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:07.260]  children preschool discourages children from saying best friend now they're
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:16.100]  banning it CBS News what it's like to be a drag queen while raising kids see they
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:21.700]  can all say drag queen or those words these drag kids are proving it's never

[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:40.660]  that's what the examiner said now you can't use the word drag queen

[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:26.780]  Newsweek is royalty they are allowed to use the words it's the new royalty and
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:30.580]  once the president said all language can be destroyed there the city of Austin
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:34.740]  is officially trying to rename the name of the city saying that Stephen S.
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:40.340]  Austin was a racist meanwhile there Islamic countries literally selling
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:47.460]  women and children to sex slavery no one's reporting on it so that's where I
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:52.940]  come from on this here's another one drag queen trans and queer people protest
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:54:02.620]  Trump in London gay star news now why do I show you this drag queens and kings
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:08.220]  organized rally to oppose Donald Trump in UK meet the drag queens protesting
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:13.820]  Donald Trump again visit on and on and on but what did they tell us I'm going to
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:18.740]  show you right here they said you don't work use any of those terms and you
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:24.300]  don't report on it because the community doesn't like it that's southern
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.380]  poverty law center flaggers please review the community standards and they
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:34.500]  took down our video that simply shows the demonstrations cross dressers and
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:40.660]  transsexuals gather at Trump protests in London and then those are the names of
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:48.900]  the groups they use but we aren't even allowed to report what's going on you see
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:54.220]  how that works and then here's our article on it this goes on in public
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:55:03.020]  city streets and then we simply say here it is look at it and politically people
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:07.860]  in the streets in the West say you don't have speech we're going to bar you
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:14.900]  because we you dare even show what we're saying and what we're doing you talk
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:18.700]  about discrimination you talk about all this and that's where the n-word comes
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:23.020]  in because once they set the precedent that if you're not white you can use the
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:28.020]  n-word I find the defensive anybody uses it but you've got a right to use it
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:33.500]  we're growing up in Dallas playing sports about half my friends were black
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:38.700]  and most of them were Christian you know upstanding folks I found to be more
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:42.900]  moral than most of the white people I know but then I'd be over at their house
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.540]  or something their cousin would come over they'd be using n-word this or that
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:50.220]  I remember there one of my friends moms come in and say and you shut your mouth
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:55.820]  and don't use that word and her throwing him out of the house the cousin that
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:56:04.860]  visited as he was using it but that was 35 years ago very offensive but you know
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:11.140]  what somebody's got the right to use it and people have a right to say it's
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:14.540]  wrong but now it's
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:21.340]  and I'm not afraid of them banning me I'm not gonna play their game the T word
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:25.340]  they go well now we have the recordings they go we want you to use transsexual
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:31.980]  or drag queen and we're like okay we'll play that game and sure enough a year
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:40.220]  later we got three recordings Facebook Twitter and YouTube calling us saying
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:46.220]  you will not use this or you will be banned and we got recordings and now a
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:50.540]  year later they're saying now don't use that word God what words can we use here
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:56.860]  but again that's the power of the control and don't show ABC news and Yahoo news
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:01.460]  of some punk kid punching an adult in the face over and over gonna get pushed
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:08.020]  the ground because we're gonna say you did it we're gonna defame you and then
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:12.460]  we're not even gonna show the video and thousands of articles about you that
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:19.460]  shows the organized criminal activity in corporate media and the fact that they've
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.980]  got armies of people for a paycheck that'll lie and take the press release
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:26.420]  and rewrite it for their newspaper it's all the same plagiarized article
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:29.900]  everywhere just like they said Trump hates Mexicans and says they're all
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:33.980]  rapists and criminals there's no video there's no audio he never said it but
[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:38.660]  they don't care because they're an organized pack of criminal liars and

[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:59.060]  and i'm trying to tell people to contact their congressman if they feel
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:03.140]  something going on so that's what i did and so you know you gave me the courage
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:05.700]  to make these videos and every one of them i put
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:09.540]  chase the patriot for info wars dot com right and so
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:13.460]  when they see that i know i'm in their algorithm and then all sudden i started
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:17.220]  to see my views significantly be dropped and also i have
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.420]  cousins from all over and we had a family reunion
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:24.020]  and then i find out they're not getting my notifications just like anyone else

[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:39.700]  contact with his office and it just shows the power of info wars
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:42.980]  here i am an ordinary patriot from tellery california
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:46.420]  but i can take action action and i can make change
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.580]  so you know again i'm thank you for letting me start chase the patriot
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.460]  i really hope you look at my videos and brother i've been seeing them we
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.820]  appreciate you but that's the deal newness and all them are busy
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:03:00.020]  and and that's why they're smart people we get them reports we call them
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:03.700]  they hear from citizens what's happening everybody's got to call congress
[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:07.220]  why do you think they're trying to totally ban me now because i'm trying to
[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:11.540]  rally people to get out there and explain how you've been
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:15.780]  censored by these monsters that that's what i'm saying it's it's it's it's
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:20.100]  literal chinese communist level censorship come to america
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:23.220]  and as conservatives we don't bitch and complain we just
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:26.500]  are used to being discriminated against but this is the big push
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:30.020]  and now trump is aware of it where's his tweet let me show you
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:33.700]  he says uh twitter shadow banning prominent republicans not good
[02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:36.500]  will look into this discriminatory legal practice at once
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.740]  many complaints so and look ted cruise you know he can't give me a backhanded
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:43.460]  support he said you know jones says my dad killed
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:47.220]  uh jfk uh but still i don't think facebook should be able to cut him off
[02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.820]  and say what's free speech well sir i didn't say that
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:54.420]  i like your voting record i really respected you until you lied about trump
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:57.460]  and then you pulled a bunch of side deals
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:01.860]  with the never crumpers and the neocons and
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:06.420]  uh stone pointed out that eyewitnesses and they have photos of your dad in the
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:11.860]  cia high iq very intelligent cuban
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:15.380]  in the middle of that whole thing with his whole background i mean come on the
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:18.020]  word is he didn't kill jfk he was in the cia
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:21.140]  so don't reportedly he honorably served in it i mean don't be ashamed of it
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:23.860]  he dropped out of the race right after he came out but the point is
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:29.060]  even ted cruise gets that and understands what's going on with all of that
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:32.100]  and so that's all i'm getting in here with that so god bless you i appreciate
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:36.260]  your call absolutely folks they fear you ahead of this ramp up of
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:40.100]  censorship the midterms getting in there and trump making a campaign issue
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:43.300]  it's the truth it's constitutional it's a winning issue
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:47.220]  and it's critical to do it to save free speech so let's go crazy like chickens

[02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:02.820]  respected former fbi agent also veteran and he is the
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:06.100]  author of the book raising a jihadi generation the book
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:10.020]  can be purchased at his website understanding the threat.com
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:15.300]  or at amazon.com and he joins us again a counter-terrorism expert former
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:18.900]  leading fbi agent and all of this but what he really has is courage because i
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:23.620]  can tell you right now i know a lot of fbi agents
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:28.340]  growing up i knew a lot of fbi agents and
[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:32.340]  their patriots on average very patriotic i'd say christian conservative
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:36.900]  whatever you want to say very dedicated and when i criticize moeller or any
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:39.460]  of these people they go oh you hate the fbi that's not what trump's doing we
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:43.380]  hate the democrat operatives that are in there that have been caught doing all
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:46.180]  this crazy stuff and i'm just putting that up front because they
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:49.940]  misrepresent every time and they misrepresent what trump says what i say
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:53.860]  but i remember like five years ago reading about brennan when he was
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:58.260]  heading up the caa for obama and he headed it up until trump got into
[02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:01.860]  office and hearing he was a voted for the communist and he
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:06.500]  would he converted to wahhabism and i didn't believe it i mean i
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:10.020]  thought that look it's one thing to hire a bunch of sjw is low level but i don't
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:13.540]  think they put a guy in who voted for communist and it was a new yorker
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:16.660]  magazine and it was in other publications
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:20.100]  and then that he had been the section chief in riyadh and it had been said
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:23.380]  that you know he was in ceremonies with the muslims and all this
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.860]  and then i talked to other folks that actually were involved in the army
[02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:31.700]  and the cia and they said no listen we thought he might be a double agent we
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:34.420]  checked no no he wasn't doing this under authorization
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:38.100]  by obama to convert to islam decades before
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:41.860]  or by other groups he actually converted so the real expert is john
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:46.740]  gondolo joining us former fbi agent counterterrorism specialist
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:49.940]  former marine you name it to to to get into the whole
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:54.980]  mindset and just what it shows about who these deep state people really are
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:58.100]  john thanks for coming on thanks for having me again alex
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:01.220]  appreciate it you're the expert you've got the floor
[02:09:01.220 --> 02:09:04.580]  of the next two segments i mean what are we facing this window into the
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:07.300]  weirdness of john brennan because if i don't even
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:11.380]  believe this five years ago and then it's true it's so crazy who could even
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:15.220]  believe this right well i was the first one to break
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:18.980]  the story on a uh television program run by a
[02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:22.260]  group called the united west an online program
[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:26.020]  and the question was posed to me about john brennan
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:29.300]  and what i said then is what i'll say now is that
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:35.860]  i have uh sources multiple sources that witnessed john brennan
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:39.140]  or have direct knowledge of john brennan saying the
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:42.340]  islamic shahada the statement of faith of islam
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:47.780]  which converts you into islam but he did it while he was the acting station
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.660]  chief meaning the number one guy for the cia
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:55.300]  in saudi arabia in the 90s and present in the room where saudi government
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:59.060]  and officials officials including mubahith which is
[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:03.300]  saudi intelligence so my concern was not only that he
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:08.020]  converted the the bigger concern was uh the way it came about and then it
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:12.580]  looked and smelled a lot like in a recruiting operation by the saudi's
[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:20.740]  of our number one cia guy in uh in the country and then um for a few years i
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:24.020]  took a significant amount of heat for making these
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:28.020]  comments until just uh approximately six or eight
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:32.580]  months ago when a retired station chief from the cia
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:38.180]  went on tv and said it was very well known in the agency
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:42.980]  that john brennan had converted to islam and so he confirmed
[02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:46.180]  what my sources who had been in saudi arabia had said
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:51.380]  and and this is the problem it's not only that he converted islam
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:54.580]  it's that if you look at his behavior patterns
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:58.340]  he has spoken at major muslim brotherhood
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:02.020]  conferences inside the united states and north america including
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:06.260]  the islamic society of north america he has defended
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:11.300]  uh what they're doing he has defended jihad saying it is an obligation in
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:14.820]  islam and we shouldn't be afraid of it even though
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:19.780]  100 of islamic law defines jihad as warfare against non muslims that's
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:24.980]  obligatory and until jihad is until sharia islamic law
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:28.900]  is the law of the land and and of course what you just mentioned about the
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:32.820]  fact that he admitted publicly that he
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.420]  voted for a communist i mean you have got
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:41.620]  numerous members of the previous and still in the current administration and
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:46.980]  the bureaucracy openly open communist marxist
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:50.900]  socialists of different you know flavors
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.620]  malice and there seems to me i think the the biggest
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:59.620]  problem is there is no sense of urgency
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:03.860]  in this war there's no sense of urgency in the war uh with islam there's no
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:07.780]  sense of war urgency in the war against the marxists
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:12.660]  and that to me is the greatest problem and i believe the reason for that is
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:17.780]  the american people are not getting a read real detailed
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:23.300]  understanding of this problem except for a few outlets including yours
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.940]  i remember reading it in like the washington times and even the new york
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:28.900]  times what was it 10 15 years ago you you were in the fbi then you can correct
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:31.860]  me but when did muller start saying that there's no
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:34.740]  such thing as islamic terror and they started removing that and then obama
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:38.020]  got in and no investigation could be about islamic and then they started
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:41.300]  saying the fordhood shooter you know it wasn't a terror attack
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:45.140]  and and then we i mean we see all of this as the result and then
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:49.060]  the former head of homeland security napolitano jan napolitano said no no the
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:52.340]  main threat is veterans and gun owners and christians
[02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:55.780]  that's our main terror threat even though on the terror rickerscale it's the
[02:12:55.780 --> 02:13:00.900]  most nonviolent group right so let me uh hopefully break
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:05.140]  this down very briefly for your audience and and that is this
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:09.940]  the primary way that the islamic movement intends to win the whole war
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:15.460]  is not in the violent sector it's not through violence
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:20.100]  violence like the wars in afghanistan iraq their operations in africa and the
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:25.940]  philippines and elsewhere in europe and in the united states in the middle east
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:29.780]  those are tactics that fit into a broader strategy
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:33.300]  the main line of effort if you will and that's a military phrase
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:38.740]  for their overall strategy is primarily in the nonviolent realm
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:44.980]  and in europe and the united states almost all of the prominent islamic
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:48.100]  groups in europe and the united states we can demonstrate
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:51.300]  are either muslim brotherhood organizations
[02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:55.620]  or are absolutely aligned with the brotherhood's
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:14:00.100]  strategy which is to impose an islamic state under sharia
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:03.220]  which is what the muslim brotherhood bylaws say
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:06.340]  and you can get those at our website understandathreat.com
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:11.700]  as it relates to what you're asking i would just quote a couple years ago
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:15.780]  the guy who ran the counterterrorism and technical support office
[02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:18.900]  for the pentagon and ran a lot of special operations
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:22.740]  and covert operations for the dod during the wars
[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:27.060]  he left the government service and said on a national radio program
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:31.620]  that the muslim brotherhood controls the national security decision-making
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:35.940]  process inside the united states government and that is a
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:39.300]  statement that understanding the threat and me as the leader of
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:43.540]  understanding threat or utt i could absolutely concur with that
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:47.140]  when you look when you talk about the training when you look at
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:54.340]  the 9-11 report hundreds of times the word jihad muslim islam
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:58.900]  al-qaeda isis sharia jihad those words are used
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:04.660]  in the 9-11 report to describe the enemy the threat that we face
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:08.180]  this is really important because our war fighting doctrine says
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:11.540]  when you analyze a threat you begin with who they say they are and why they're
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:15.860]  fighting and 100 percent of the jihadis from the 9-11
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:19.060]  hijackers to the boston marathon bombers to the attack
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:22.420]  attackers and so they were doing it for islam obviously and that's right
[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:25.460]  and the thing i get censored for more than anything is simply pointing out
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:28.740]  what they say when i talk about it i get censored when we come back i want to
[02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:32.420]  look at big picture then why it matters that brennan converted to this
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:35.300]  and and and how it hooked into obama and these
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:39.780]  stay behind networks we know they have and you know obviously the big one
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:43.220]  iran's an islamic state so is saudi arabia so if he converts
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:46.740]  to islam in in the presence of their government that is a conversion to a
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:49.940]  foreign government uh that's treason that's that's espionage that's that's
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:55.060]  being a foreign agent uh we'll be right back stay with us

[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:48.660]  ago i said everybody's talking about caliphates
[02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:52.580]  islamic takeovers that's a bunch of anti-terrorism hype
[02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:55.860]  that's never gonna happen they can't get their act together now the borders are
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:58.660]  all being broken down they're funding attacks on russia europe
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:03.060]  10 million military age men have poured in you criticize imams saying kill gays
[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:06.660]  kill liberals the left comes out and attacks you you get banned on youtube
[02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:10.340]  facebook uh the lawsuits being financed by us we
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:13.700]  know the saudi government members of the national federal reserve who's an
[02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:18.180]  islamicist he's involved in it the guy that owns shabani yogurt i mean you
[02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:22.100]  learn who's got the power when they come down on you and so john gondolo has been
[02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:26.100]  a longtime fbi agent now a retired counter-terrorism expert marine
[02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:29.700]  a lot of covert operations and he got briefed on brennan being a communist
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:32.020]  being an islamicist and now all that's come out
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:36.660]  35 000 foot view on this and understanding the thread.com
[02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:39.860]  what's their in game why is the left allied with them
[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:44.580]  and then how has trump basically at least paused that or disrupted that
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:48.500]  because i mean i love america but i'm actually ashamed
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.700]  that people aren't more pro trump when it's so obvious that
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:54.420]  he's the first real american president a long time and
[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:57.460]  i just thank my lucky stars i wonder where we'd be if it wasn't for him and
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:01.460]  what obama was planning well i think to answer your first
[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:04.580]  party question that thanks that's a that's a great question
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:08.820]  is it is all about sharia for the islamic movement it's all about sharia
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:12.900]  al qaeda says what they're doing is to establish an islamic state under sharia
[02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:16.980]  that's what isa says boka haram al shabaab al-sayaf
[02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:22.740]  hamas hezbollah iran it's what the entire muslim world
[02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:26.260]  under the umbrella of the organization of islamic
[02:22:26.260 --> 02:22:30.660]  cooperation which is all 57 islamic states on the planet
[02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:34.900]  largest voting bloc in the u.s like you said they play the good cop
[02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:38.660]  just like i'm not attacking the the irish but you know a lesser thing there
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:42.500]  but obviously you had like shin fey and he had the you know the bad cop good cop
[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:46.900]  thing that's right what they're doing the suit wearing jihadis as i call them
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:50.820]  the ones who wear suits and purport to be nice and they work with our white house
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:54.340]  with our defense department with the fbi
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:58.100]  they purport to be and pretend to be friendly but
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:02.260]  the facts are on the table that these are muslim brotherhood organizations
[02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:06.820]  whose bylaws say that they're required to fight the enemies and tyrants of the law
[02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:11.860]  until they establish an islamic state exactly the same objective as isis and
[02:23:11.860 --> 02:23:16.580]  al qaeda so if you look at the organizations our government
[02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:20.980]  is working with the islamic side in north america muslim public affairs council
[02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:24.420]  council and american islamic relations muslim american side on and on
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:28.500]  those are all muslim brotherhood groups who have the same ideology as isis and
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:34.500]  al qaeda the left their ideology is to impose a form of the
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:38.420]  foundation of marxism so whether it's a socialist government or communist
[02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:41.460]  government and that's right always notice these
[02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:45.300]  imams these prominent imams called the overthrow of capitalism
[02:23:45.300 --> 02:23:48.980]  and free market which meshes with the liberals that's right
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:54.260]  and uh as what we've seen is hamas groups and hamas is a part of the muslim
[02:23:54.260 --> 02:23:57.860]  brotherhood uh openly their leaders openly saying
[02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:01.060]  you know we're aligned with these groups black lives matter
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:04.180]  we see them aligned with code pink and antifa
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:08.020]  and answer act now stop we're in recess these hardcore
[02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:11.780]  left-wing groups these um sure so what's their plan i want to get back for a
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:14.500]  full hour if you'll come back soon but what what's their you're an expert on
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:18.020]  this what's their plan i mean i know you're global caliphate but
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:21.060]  how's their plan going and then and then and how has trump gotten the middle of
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:23.940]  that from the perspective of the islamic
[02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:26.660]  movement they're winning and they're nearly
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:30.900]  unopposed and i would concur with their assessment of where they are
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:33.860]  um even people that seem to understand this
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:37.860]  they're again i go back to there's no sense of urgency the good news is
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:42.340]  this president at a gut level seems to understand that islam is the problem
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:46.420]  but he is surrounded by a number of people who don't understand it some of
[02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:49.460]  them like now that ambassador john bolton is in like
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:52.660]  pompeo uh general kelly understands the muslim
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:55.460]  brother is a threat but they don't seem to understand the
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:59.140]  the bigger totality of the threat how could kelly not get it they killed his
[02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:02.740]  son well because i think a lot of people
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:06.660]  like him he gets that this is an organized movement but that the muslim
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:10.180]  brotherhood is a radical group and they don't represent
[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:15.300]  your average everyday muslim but islam isn't that part of islam like you said
[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:19.460]  muhammad said lie and tell him you're friendly yes yes of course
[02:25:19.460 --> 02:25:23.300]  and that's what they do and we've caught them in numerous lies
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:27.220]  and uh and yet we still continue i i just want to say their
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:31.540]  their purpose is to the islamic movement and the left
[02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:35.540]  working together from the purpose of the or the perspective of the islamic
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:39.540]  movement they will they will um coordinate with
[02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:44.980]  others and they'll work with others uh but they can never officially partner
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:48.100]  with them uh if they don't follow sharia so they
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:52.180]  will use the left and as we've seen in history uh
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:57.140]  when the islamic of course according to their plan when they take over uh the
[02:25:57.140 --> 02:26:00.980]  first people there they will kill will be the marxists the leftists i was about
[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:03.380]  to say in fact we played an email earlier is one of the most
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:07.220]  prominent european saying we're letting them bring us in but they're our main
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:11.380]  enemy the left once we get control and then i see afghans saved from deportation
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:13.540]  who've been involved in sex assault you name it
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:17.940]  by ellen erison was convicted of abuse and sentenced to jail
[02:26:17.940 --> 02:26:22.660]  she jumps on an airplane blocks it takes it over to keep some 50-something-year-old
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:27.940]  scumbag from being flown out what the hell is wrong with the left
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:32.660]  well i think i think we need to look at it we need to just speak honestly i mean
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:36.820]  what understanding the threat does is we speak truth boldly that's what you need
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:39.540]  to do i think we it's one of the most important
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:42.980]  things in this war since this is primarily a war
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:46.900]  of narratives it is an information war primarily
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:50.340]  the violence serves that war so when there's violence
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:53.860]  the suit wearing jihadis can get closer to our government officials
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:58.100]  by saying they use it to play the part of the conciliary the good cop
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:01.540]  that's right and so when you see what the left is doing
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:06.180]  these are marxists these are enemies of the united states and the democrat party
[02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:09.060]  has become the marxist party of the united states
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:12.900]  and i really think that that we need to understand
[02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:16.180]  that the leadership of the national democrat party are enemies of the united
[02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:19.540]  states we need to stop they really are they admit they
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.420]  don't want prosperity they admit they hate the country they've been trained
[02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:25.220]  in closing come back next week for a full hour so we really appreciate you and
[02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:28.180]  the work you're doing you've been on before you come with roger a lot
[02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:31.780]  in one minute what do i need to do seriously what because you've been
[02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:34.740]  proven right i've been wrong about this you know until
[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:38.740]  like a decade ago what do i need to do to stop this for my family
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:43.540]  well if you understand how widespread the network here is in the united
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:47.780]  states this mirrors and in and a counterinsurgency
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:50.980]  militarily the the tip of the spear the focal point
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:54.500]  is at the local level so that's why we focus
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:59.860]  more with local police sheriffs pastors business owners key prominent
[02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:02.820]  they've also not been compromised as much
[02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:06.820]  correct and while you do have some of that they're a lot more
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:11.140]  open to the truth and i think sharing this information with them
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:14.820]  getting the materials to them we would love to brief

[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:44.980]  down a month and a half ago now they're calling in the new york times
[02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:50.100]  vice magazine for me to be taken off spotify i mean they're just get us off
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:53.940]  the year everywhere and and believe me just like
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:57.860]  senator cruz said just like tucker carlson said they get me they get
[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:01.060]  everybody so that's coming up but john you're going to join us again next week
[02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:04.420]  for a full hour former fbi agent counterterrorism expert
[02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:08.340]  understanding the threat dot com just briefly what about iran because from my
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:11.860]  own research just you know i mean i know the whole hobbyist has a
[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:15.460]  terror movement the rest of it it seems like the iranians have an embedded
[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:19.060]  really big dangerous group and then now their their
[02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:22.900]  former head of intelligence came out and actually threatened trump that well if
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:26.100]  you try something with us or if you stand up to us we're going to activate
[02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:31.700]  terror networks right iran is a massive threat
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:35.940]  but i want to keep hammer in this point
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:39.700]  that whether we're talking about iran shia
[02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:44.180]  or uh saudi arabia sunni isa sunni al qaeda sunni
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:50.420]  muslim brotherhood say no they all because it's the same quran and the same
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:55.460]  prophet muhammad that commands war until the entire world is under sharia
[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:59.300]  islamic law uh muhammad is the beautiful
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:04.180]  pattern of conduct according to the quran for all muslims to follow for all
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:09.300]  times uh he tortured he beheaded people he married a six-year-old
[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:13.700]  he had people killed who mocked him yeah he waged war against non-muslims
[02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:16.980]  unless they converted islam or submitted to islamic law
[02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:23.300]  so he's the perfect example and so in iran and saudi arabia the objective is
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:27.460]  the same but there are serious differences but as far as what the
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:32.260]  the threat that i ran and their government proxy
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:36.500]  hisbola and the iranian iranian revolution or guard core
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:41.620]  that they pose the united states is significant and i would concur with uh
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:45.460]  some of the assessments by government officials that it's a bigger threat than
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:50.580]  the al qaeda or isis threat it is a massive threat and needs to be dealt
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:55.220]  with but like most things these things are not being dealt with domestically
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:35:57.780]  at all sure without getting into classified areas
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:00.980]  people i've talked to and family that was in army special operations dealing
[02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:05.380]  with iran for decades they said listen iran isn't trying to get
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:09.220]  headlines they're getting people burrowed into every area and i mean i'm not
[02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:11.700]  going to say something that in secret some of their manuals are how to get
[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:15.060]  through the top of a big building dump chlorine gas down in i mean they've got
[02:36:15.060 --> 02:36:19.620]  some real sleeper cells i'm told all over the u.s all over europe
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:24.420]  and i mean that of and i say if i ran tax or ships wherever let them have it
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:27.140]  i'm just saying what are the politically correct people going to do
[02:36:27.140 --> 02:36:31.140]  when you know 20 u.s cities have 50 000 dead people on one day are we going to
[02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:36.260]  roll over to iran well i think hopefully this
[02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:41.140]  administration will deal with it before uh the tragedy happens
[02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:45.780]  they're clearly in a war footing against us
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:49.620]  the previous president committed a felony by providing a
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:53.060]  nation state designated nation state of terrorism iran
[02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:56.420]  with billions of dollars that's a that's a felony
[02:36:56.420 --> 02:37:01.060]  not sure why that is not being prosecuted but this is this is where we
[02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:05.220]  are and until we deal with it until we understand that
[02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:09.380]  all of the muslim student associations over 800 chapters on every major
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:13.140]  college campus is a muslim brotherhood
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:17.620]  you know frontier there that we have over 3,300 mosques
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:20.740]  and islamic centers in the united states and all 50 states
[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:23.860]  the vast majority of them are controlled by the muslim brotherhood
[02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:27.700]  and a percentage of those that aren't are controlled by iranian assets
[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:31.540]  by the way i don't know you got to go but the gulan movement we just mentioned
[02:37:31.540 --> 02:37:34.420]  them in all hell broke loose with lawsuits and
[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:37.860]  hack attacks and that's one of the that's the biggest private school operator
[02:37:37.860 --> 02:37:40.980]  in the u.s sure the harmony schools the garment
[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:44.980]  gulan schools these are part of the islamic network and that
[02:37:44.980 --> 02:37:48.660]  the the fact that we simply have christians
[02:37:48.660 --> 02:37:52.340]  and law enforcement and military and political leaders
[02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:57.620]  and citizens that do not understand the core doctrine of islam
[02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:03.060]  then we can't have the basic conversation about what to do
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:07.300]  yes are there muslims who don't want to subscribe to sharia and live under sharia
[02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:11.380]  yes but a muslim who doesn't subscribe to sharia does not constitute a different
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:15.460]  version of islam and so you got to begin
[02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:18.660]  with what our own war fighting doctrine says you begin
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:21.780]  with what they say they're fighting for and why they're fighting
[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:25.140]  and they all unanimously say it's for islam and they try to make it politically
[02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:28.900]  incorrect to say what they actually stand for john gondola former fbi
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:32.420]  author researcher thank you so much thanks for having me

[02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:05.780]  conspiracy among big tech companies to censor him and other far right
[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:08.420]  media outlets so he's fighting back by hosting his
[02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:12.020]  podcast on spotify of all places and the southern prairie law center

[02:47:55.220 --> 02:48:02.420]  you know god i begged on my knees early last week to create an assange
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:05.780]  petition which actually has an effect to give to congress the president
[02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:09.620]  and and and it was like an afterthought friday they were gonna like stick it
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:12.420]  right at the end of the show and then metaphysically it was done again
[02:48:12.420 --> 02:48:17.140]  today and i'm not mad at the crew i just you know it's
[02:48:17.140 --> 02:48:20.660]  like this thing like the more important something is the more it
[02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:25.220]  doesn't matter the more it's just like nothing
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:29.460]  like our free speech or capitalism or anything
[02:48:29.460 --> 02:48:32.740]  it's an afterthought because
[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:37.860]  so so i'll launch this assange petition tomorrow or i'm gonna
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:41.940]  i'm gonna cancel the show permanently it's a decision i've made
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:45.780]  i'm gonna come in here tomorrow and i'm gonna launch this at the start of the
[02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:49.380]  show or i'm going to shut info wars down
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:52.580]  i'll probably forget it but that metaphysically is the symbol that i must
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:59.540]  shut the doors because if i can't even in six days
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:03.220]  put a petition out for julien assange to be pardoned
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:07.540]  they're about to extra items the us then i shouldn't be
[02:49:07.540 --> 02:49:10.500]  on the air
[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:19.540]  it's like that fbi agent former counterterrorism guy big star in the fbi
[02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:23.700]  the lot of great stuff said there's no urgency there's no pulse there's no
[02:49:23.700 --> 02:49:27.220]  there's no differentiation you've got a billion eight hundred million muslims
[02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:30.420]  saying we're gonna conquer you we're gonna kill you we're gonna murder you
[02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:34.260]  europe has opened up to it and no one even cares and then there's a thousand
[02:49:34.260 --> 02:49:39.380]  articles a day or more saying ban alex jones and saying outrageous lies
[02:49:39.380 --> 02:49:42.980]  like i was gonna poison david hog no proof
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:47.780]  or i beat up a kid no proof and it's like you don't feel insulted by people
[02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:50.660]  doing that to you
[02:49:57.700 --> 02:50:01.620]  what the petition doesn't even line up straight just take it off i'm not doing
[02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:06.180]  it i'm just shutting it down maybe you know humanity just has to fall
[02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:10.660]  it has civilization has to fall all the lefts and their big high rises
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:14.580]  learn how to tie their shoelaces who prey on those of us that work it just
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:18.420]  has to go down and you know it's gonna go down too
[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:24.500]  and i just have been a fool trying to prop it up god i've tried hard too god i've
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:26.980]  tried so hard
[02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:34.660]  there's the answer we're not doing the assange thing it's not going to happen
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:39.380]  none of it's going to happen it's like push notifications on the new app
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:42.740]  the push notifications need to go out when we go live
[02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:47.060]  at special times and we're like oh we didn't turn that on it's like oh great
[02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:52.180]  you know it's like it's like there's some type of spirit of like i don't
[02:50:52.180 --> 02:50:56.500]  explain it like the only energy is evil and so you don't get energy unless
[02:50:56.500 --> 02:50:59.780]  you're evil and then the evil people are like hopping around like gremlins
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:04.660]  sabotaging everything 30 of the public's on psychotropic
[02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:09.860]  cancer is exploding off the charts and people love it
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:17.220]  they live for it it's it's it's it's it's just
[02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:23.380]  it's like god to them being lied to being a failure being destroyed it is like
[02:51:23.380 --> 02:51:27.220]  sexy it's like and then trump comes in and like tries to deliver and turn
[02:51:27.220 --> 02:51:31.220]  things around and all these cowards they just want the media to agree with and
[02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:34.500]  they go oh we hate him too
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:39.300]  i hate my 401k i hate my pay going up i hate him trying to cut the cost of
[02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:43.460]  prescription drugs i want to be loved by cnn even though i
[02:51:43.460 --> 02:51:46.180]  don't watch it
[02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:55.300]  i'll tell you the failings of trump he said he'd expose vaccines he know that
[02:51:55.300 --> 02:51:59.620]  vaccines almost brain damage barrened he came back he bounced back
[02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:04.180]  in him he knows uh asanj wasn't a russian agent there's no evidence of that
[02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:07.220]  and hillary had the illegal server and the info was everywhere and
[02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:12.740]  people got it out and then we exposed the crime so thank god he knows all that
[02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:23.940]  so you know i want to criticize trump there it is
[02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:28.020]  and the so-called left this country they're not the left
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:33.780]  they're a bunch of deranged criminals who hate themselves so much that they
[02:52:33.780 --> 02:52:38.660]  are projecting absolute abject hatred on anyone
[02:52:38.660 --> 02:52:42.180]  else having a voice and are the most anti-free speech
[02:52:42.180 --> 02:52:47.460]  anti-liberal people on the planet and they've gone from denying they were
[02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:51.780]  ever censoring a year ago to raging around
[02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:56.740]  saying we want alex jones shut up and then misrepresenting what i've said
[02:52:56.740 --> 02:53:01.620]  it's incredible and every scumbag and slime ball and
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:06.260]  weird heroin addict and you name it has crawled out from under rocks
[02:53:06.260 --> 02:53:11.940]  people i barely knew 15 years ago to then tell giant lies about me which is
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:14.180]  even greater it'll impeach everything they're doing
[02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:17.860]  it's just at a certain point you're like god almighty
[02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:23.860]  this is what death looks like this is what laziness looks like
[02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:41.540]  you know humans don't communicate anymore or they they jibber and jabber
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:45.140]  about stuff that doesn't matter and then they send a text message
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:48.820]  and never communicate with anybody about anything
[02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:53.380]  of substance it's spiritual death
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:59.380]  and people are ugly now they're stupid their IQs are dropping they're dying
[02:53:59.380 --> 02:54:02.100]  all around us
[02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:09.860]  i feel like a failure god if i ruled the planet i feel like i ruled a pile of
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:14.020]  cockroaches or something i mean who the hell would want to rule this
[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:18.100]  see god wants to turn people loose and see them
[02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:22.260]  be strong and that's where we were and now everything is turning down
[02:54:22.260 --> 02:54:25.380]  everything is failing
[02:54:32.180 --> 02:54:36.580]  the gods of the system are john pedesta and hillary clinton
[02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:40.580]  who both look like methhead mental patients
[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:46.260]  and act like them and we bow this is what because only scum like that
[02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:51.540]  would even seek power in something like this
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:58.420]  unbelievable unspeakable
[02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:07.860]  i don't even know what to say at this point because i've i've run my course
[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:12.580]  not with a censorship in the attacks but i just
[02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:17.940]  belong to some other age i guess
[02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:22.740]  because there isn't any immediacy there isn't any concern there's just
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:27.860]  kind of jellyfish brain where initiatives mean nothing like we have
[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:31.140]  totally legal censorship going on we have them bragging about it we have
[02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:34.340]  them dead to rights no one will attack
[02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:37.460]  and then i'm being totally shut down because we're writing reports are getting
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:39.460]  at the congress and they're they're beginning to act
[02:55:39.460 --> 02:55:42.020]  i'm not that damn smart you know how easy this is
[02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:47.620]  jesus but no one wants to do it no one has the instinct or the will to execute
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:52.660]  anything real they only execute failure
[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:58.500]  over and over and over again but getting the failure but getting it as the
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:56:02.340]  public begins to look like servile hippopotamuses
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:05.860]  lobotomized uh and you're like oh well just join the
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:10.100]  establishment it sees the and then oh the establishments feeding on the
[02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:13.300]  the subhumans oh let me look at the the establishment are like a bunch of
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:17.220]  craved vampires on pcp i sure as hell don't want to
[02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:20.900]  join them and then i just come to the realization
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:24.260]  out of trillions of worlds we're going to probably die
[02:56:24.260 --> 02:56:27.300]  and everything we did as a species and all of our beauty and all of our goodness
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:30.660]  will just fail and we're going to go down the tubes because a bunch of
[02:56:30.660 --> 02:56:34.900]  inbred child molesters in hollywood had some psychotic
[02:56:34.900 --> 02:56:38.820]  dream that they wanted to kill everybody and so we all just rolled over by peer
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:41.860]  pressure and gave in to it and never executed anything real
[02:56:41.860 --> 02:56:45.140]  never did anything real never took action when all the tools were right
[02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:49.860]  there in our hands because we weren't meant to we couldn't do it we didn't
[02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:52.180]  want it
[02:56:54.180 --> 02:56:58.980]  your solent is coming up we probably won't have that
[02:56:58.980 --> 02:57:05.460]  thanks for joining us on tomorrow probably never
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:08.820]  because humanity is going to be slaughtered in mass
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:12.340]  and almost all of you are going to die excruciating long painful deaths
[02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:16.420]  all the globalists suck every dime out of you with weaponized cancer
[02:57:16.420 --> 02:57:19.940]  and you'll never even know what hits you so
[02:57:19.940 --> 02:57:23.860]  celebrate our censorship celebrate your leftist garbage

[02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:14.980]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights

[03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:34.740]  so
[03:00:47.380 --> 03:00:53.380]  hi this is gerald solanti what an honor what an honor to be on info wars and
[03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:58.980]  of course following alex jones and what a wild ride we're on huh
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:03.380]  so today i want to talk about a couple of things the markets are in everybody's
[03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:06.980]  mind not everybody but you know as the markets go so
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:11.940]  too often does the economy so there's a lot going on right now
[03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:15.220]  and among the things that are going on right now
[03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:19.060]  well it's not a great day over here in the uh in the states
[03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:24.500]  on the market front we're looking at the nasdaq down over one percent
[03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:31.140]  and those fang stocks those facebook's and amazon apples and netflix
[03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:36.660]  and google's yeah they're not doing as great as they uh
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:40.100]  they should be doing and some of the aspects of them
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:45.060]  i want to start with facebook first used to be a thing called myspace years
[03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:50.020]  ago i was old enough to remember that one it came and it went
[03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:54.980]  and that's what we see with facebook the time that is coming gone
[03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:58.020]  for many ways that doesn't mean it'll evaporate
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:05.940]  but to think to think that there is just one major social media site like
[03:02:05.940 --> 03:02:11.060]  facebook is a joke because after all the suckerberg's a joke too
[03:02:11.060 --> 03:02:16.580]  if if you like jokestants and there's really an on trend
[03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:22.340]  pinot opportunity to really out google and out facebook
[03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:26.340]  and out twitter what's there already you know trends are born they grow they
[03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:30.420]  mature reach old age and die the whole technology trend
[03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:36.180]  you know it's brand new it's like being in 1900
[03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:39.940]  and they just invented the automobile now or in 1918
[03:02:39.940 --> 03:02:44.900]  well they came out earlier than that but really production started to go on
[03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:49.380]  so we're only you know it that's where we are i mean the internet revolution
[03:02:49.380 --> 03:02:54.580]  really didn't even begin until around 1994
[03:02:54.580 --> 03:02:58.500]  so there's a lot of growth opportunities and possibilities
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:03.780]  and you're looking at it with these overvalued and overleveraged stocks
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:06.980]  so in staying with the stock market and the fangs
[03:03:06.980 --> 03:03:10.420]  and what's going on and how they're losing them fangs
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:15.620]  is a big factor here is that they're overvalued and overleveraged
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:21.140]  you're just seeing amazon making money now if they're losing it for many years
[03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:26.100]  and they have a p-e ratio that you know it's at a site
[03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:30.820]  it's over the 200 marks according to some analysts
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:34.500]  and they're not making money as much money in the retail sector as they are
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:38.660]  in other sectors so what we're saying is
[03:03:38.660 --> 03:03:42.100]  that the markets are overvalued and info wars
[03:03:42.100 --> 03:03:45.540]  warriors know that i was among the first
[03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:49.540]  magazine to come out and call the trump rally real
[03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:53.460]  just weeks after he got elected in 2016
[03:03:53.460 --> 03:03:58.740]  we're also saying the trump rally is peaked as peaked for a variety of reasons
[03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:02.740]  and one of the big ones is interest rates
[03:04:02.740 --> 03:04:06.340]  you heard trump about a week ago come out and say he's not thrilled
[03:04:06.340 --> 03:04:13.140]  with the rising interest rates guess what pending home sale numbers came out
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:18.260]  today yeah they're up a little bit but down from last year
[03:04:18.260 --> 03:04:22.500]  we don't believe the nation could take higher interest rates
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:28.340]  and it's a huge factor because what's going on now
[03:04:28.340 --> 03:04:33.060]  is that the united states is planning on raising interest rates
[03:04:33.060 --> 03:04:36.500]  while the europeans they just had a meeting last week
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:40.420]  you know when they're gonna raise them you're in negative territory now
[03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:53.940]  eh maybe sometime next summer so we're gonna be right back stay tuned
[03:04:53.940 --> 03:04:58.020]  we all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue
[03:04:58.020 --> 03:05:01.780]  info wars is proud to sell incredible filters but it's almost impossible to
[03:05:01.780 --> 03:05:05.140]  keep up with every faucet shower and sink in your home

[03:06:04.580 --> 03:06:10.260]  he aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side
[03:06:10.260 --> 03:06:14.580]  you're listening to alex jones
[03:06:14.580 --> 03:06:19.540]  yep there's a side to pick and he's right
[03:06:19.540 --> 03:06:25.460]  truth the truth shall make you free that was the uh
[03:06:25.460 --> 03:06:29.140]  actually where i went to college university charleston
[03:06:29.140 --> 03:06:32.740]  that's what they that was a slogan the truth shall set you free
[03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:36.980]  and that's what it's really about and i applaud trump for going after the
[03:06:36.980 --> 03:06:40.660]  prostitutes you're a disgusting group of people
[03:06:40.660 --> 03:06:46.340]  all they do is sell propaganda lies and agendas and you know what a
[03:06:46.340 --> 03:06:50.740]  prostitute is they get paid to put out by their
[03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:54.260]  washington whormasters and their corporate johns
[03:06:54.260 --> 03:07:00.100]  so info wars is a very essential information source that's very hard to
[03:07:00.100 --> 03:07:03.940]  find anywhere else so do all you can to support it
[03:07:03.940 --> 03:07:08.900]  support the products i'm a male vitality guy love that stuff
[03:07:08.900 --> 03:07:12.180]  and i'm feeling a little bit down i get it up
[03:07:12.180 --> 03:07:16.740]  so it makes me feel really good great products high quality
[03:07:16.740 --> 03:07:23.380]  organic a lot of amazing usa and by the way the whole tariff stuff
[03:07:23.380 --> 03:07:26.580]  you know us we said the tariff and trade war
[03:07:26.580 --> 03:07:30.740]  it's a lot of nonsense it's not going to happen the way the prostitutes are
[03:07:30.740 --> 03:07:34.180]  selling it of course there's going to be a renegotiation
[03:07:34.180 --> 03:07:39.860]  of trade who wouldn't and let's get this straight it's not china that's sold out
[03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:43.780]  this country it's the american and european corporations
[03:07:43.780 --> 03:07:47.300]  the outsourced their manufacturing to get it cheap
[03:07:47.300 --> 03:07:53.540]  in foreign nations using slave labor and gave away all the technology much of
[03:07:53.540 --> 03:07:57.780]  it for which we the people paid for so they could make more profits
[03:07:57.780 --> 03:08:03.060]  period paragraph so the trade war is i believe there's going to be
[03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:08.340]  victory on the trade war front and i attribute that to trump and of
[03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:12.180]  course you know i'm a political atheist i don't take sides i don't like
[03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:16.980]  people dislike them i like the facts and the and and what they bring
[03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:21.300]  and when we go back to the trump you know those things i totally disagree with
[03:08:21.300 --> 03:08:24.980]  them on particularly in the iranian crisis
[03:08:24.980 --> 03:08:29.220]  but again i call it as i see it i call it spade a spade
[03:08:29.220 --> 03:08:33.140]  and i could say that now at anybody calling me racist because obama's added
[03:08:33.140 --> 03:08:36.500]  in now to take it easy and that's the other thing i'm
[03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:40.100]  tired about oh if only black people and only if only
[03:08:40.100 --> 03:08:43.540]  women were in if only this were in or that were in
[03:08:43.540 --> 03:08:48.740]  good and bad comes in all races creeds colors genders religions you name it
[03:08:48.740 --> 03:08:52.900]  so i'm tired of people playing the race gender and religious cards save it for
[03:08:52.900 --> 03:08:58.100]  somebody else you know all i want to be around is the best
[03:08:58.100 --> 03:09:01.780]  people that have the truth in their hearts
[03:09:01.780 --> 03:09:06.580]  and joy and beauty in their minds and in their actions
[03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:12.100]  and liberty in their soul so i don't care what color race creed or religion it
[03:09:12.100 --> 03:09:15.380]  comes in but going back to the markets where i left
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:19.540]  off before it's interest rates that are going to bring this thing down
[03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:24.020]  it's very important the united states is raising interest rates
[03:09:24.020 --> 03:09:27.860]  as other countries aren't as i mentioned they're not going to raise
[03:09:27.860 --> 03:09:31.540]  interest rates at a negative territory in the european union
[03:09:31.540 --> 03:09:38.740]  until next summer maybe maybe so the dollars getting
[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:42.100]  stronger yes because the economy is getting
[03:09:42.100 --> 03:09:46.020]  stronger but also because the other economies are getting so weak
[03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:49.700]  and interest rates are bringing up the dollar
[03:09:49.700 --> 03:09:53.060]  oh and that's why you're seeing gold prices going down
[03:09:53.060 --> 03:09:56.500]  and again i call it like i see it people call themselves gold
[03:09:56.500 --> 03:10:00.820]  bulls this and that i say calling yourself a bull is bs
[03:10:00.820 --> 03:10:05.540]  because it runs in different directions and you could go back to our trends
[03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:09.700]  journal back in 2002 i was the first to call the beginning
[03:10:09.700 --> 03:10:13.780]  of the gold bull run and after trump got elected i said no gold
[03:10:13.780 --> 03:10:16.580]  prices are going to start going down next year
[03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:19.780]  because interest rates are going to start going up the dollar's going to get
[03:10:19.780 --> 03:10:23.220]  stronger the stronger the dollar gets the weaker goal goes
[03:10:23.220 --> 03:10:29.300]  having said all that and again i do not give financial advice
[03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:33.380]  we believe gold is at the bottom right now nearing it
[03:10:33.380 --> 03:10:36.820]  you know maybe another 50 bucks tops down
[03:10:36.820 --> 03:10:41.860]  you know below 1200 because it cost about 1200 to pull that stuff out of
[03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:45.700]  the ground and when you look at from perude
[03:10:45.700 --> 03:10:51.220]  of south africa that's the average price now let's go into another aspect
[03:10:51.220 --> 03:10:53.460]  about the economy and i'm going to make this
[03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:58.340]  first segment the first half hour really economic news
[03:10:58.340 --> 03:11:02.740]  and what we're looking at again with the strong dollar
[03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:09.540]  is that commodities are dollar based so yeah the indians like to buy
[03:11:09.540 --> 03:11:17.220]  gold but their rupee is down seven percent the chinese love to buy gold
[03:11:17.220 --> 03:11:22.420]  but you're looking at the yuan now at a 13 month low
[03:11:22.420 --> 03:11:26.260]  and no they're not bringing it down purposely
[03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:32.180]  when you're looking at the chinese data some of the numbers are bad as they were
[03:11:32.180 --> 03:11:39.300]  back in 1994 and 1996 so that's what we're really looking at
[03:11:39.300 --> 03:11:42.980]  here you have to take the big picture into account
[03:11:42.980 --> 03:11:49.780]  the the the investment in china is way way down
[03:11:49.780 --> 03:11:56.580]  their trade it's off yes they're going to be able to export more as the yuan
[03:11:56.580 --> 03:12:00.980]  grows lower but it costs them more to import
[03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:06.020]  so i mentioned about you know interest rates going up and things being based
[03:12:06.020 --> 03:12:11.860]  in dollars well how about this one oil
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:15.620]  as we're speaking oil prices now Brent crude is around
[03:12:15.620 --> 03:12:20.900]  seventy five dollars a barrel this thing goes to eighty five ninety dollars
[03:12:20.900 --> 03:12:25.460]  a barrel kiss the global equity markets
[03:12:25.460 --> 03:12:30.100]  goodbye and a lot of the economies i mentioned india
[03:12:30.100 --> 03:12:33.860]  yeah they have a stock markets booming but their rupee is down
[03:12:33.860 --> 03:12:40.340]  against the dollar india imports about 80 percent of its oil
[03:12:40.340 --> 03:12:49.300]  80 percent of its energy is imported as the currency goes down
[03:12:49.300 --> 03:12:54.740]  oil is based in dollars they got to import a lot of this stuff
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:58.340]  and they're going to pay for it what's it going to do the economy
[03:12:58.340 --> 03:13:04.100]  and it'll bring down this economy too so oil prices and interest rates
[03:13:04.100 --> 03:13:07.940]  those are the two key factors to watch right now
[03:13:07.940 --> 03:13:12.020]  and again you can see it with the housing i just mentioned
[03:13:12.020 --> 03:13:20.180]  about an initial homes pending pending home sales but also look at
[03:13:20.180 --> 03:13:24.100]  existing home sales and new home sales numbers
[03:13:24.100 --> 03:13:28.580]  they're down around a lot of the country
[03:13:28.580 --> 03:13:33.860]  and in pretty significant numbers you take a look down and you go down to new
[03:13:33.860 --> 03:13:39.460]  york you walk up down broadway go to the west village soho for rent for rent
[03:13:39.460 --> 03:13:43.060]  for rent for rent retail places for rent for rent for rent
[03:13:43.060 --> 03:13:46.260]  and people say oh yeah they're doing that so they can get tax breaks no they're
[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:50.660]  not maybe some are because they can write that off
[03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:55.780]  but no it's too expensive and people aren't making the money when you look
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:14:00.340]  at the gdp number that came out yeah it was a nice gdp raise
[03:14:00.340 --> 03:14:05.300]  but when you look at wages where are they
[03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:12.420]  median household income is below 1999 levels so wages
[03:14:12.420 --> 03:14:18.420]  when you really adjust them for inflation they're not going up much at all
[03:14:18.420 --> 03:14:23.620]  so again higher interest rates how you're going to buy a home
[03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:27.780]  when the cost of a home is going up several percent
[03:14:27.780 --> 03:14:33.700]  but your wages aren't even keeping pace with inflation
[03:14:33.700 --> 03:14:37.780]  how are you going to shop more if you have to put more into your
[03:14:37.780 --> 03:14:43.380]  gas tank costing you more that you would be spending in retail and restaurants
[03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:49.300]  so these are the things to watch so going back to our forecast
[03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:56.580]  we believe gold is bottom or near it and the upside potential once it goes over
[03:14:56.580 --> 03:15:05.460]  $1,450 an ounce boom zap over to 2000 but we haven't seen
[03:15:05.460 --> 03:15:10.100]  that in five years so that's the number i would suggest anyone interested in
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:14.740]  gold starts looking at and again gold is hovering now
[03:15:14.740 --> 03:15:21.940]  around the 1220 mark an ounce and it got another $20 to $30 downside risk
[03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:24.900]  so that's where the economy is and we're going to come back
[03:15:24.900 --> 03:15:29.300]  we're going to talk a lot about a lot more other geopolitical issues
[03:15:29.300 --> 03:15:33.380]  and economic issues that are going to be shaping the future
[03:15:33.380 --> 03:15:37.220]  and with trend forecasting what we try to do is to put you ahead of the news and

[03:15:42.580 --> 03:15:46.580]  and thrive so we're going to come back in a little bit
[03:15:46.580 --> 03:15:52.980]  thank you very much see you soon and don't forget
[03:15:52.980 --> 03:15:56.500]  i tried other brands but i came back to my sunshine

[03:17:54.100 --> 03:17:58.100]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:17:58.100 --> 03:18:01.380]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:18:01.380 --> 03:18:04.900]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[03:18:04.900 --> 03:18:10.020]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:18:10.020 --> 03:18:14.980]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[03:18:14.980 --> 03:18:19.220]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:23.380]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:18:23.380 --> 03:18:27.220]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[03:18:27.220 --> 03:18:31.060]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[03:18:31.060 --> 03:18:34.580]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:34.580 --> 03:18:38.260]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:18:38.260 --> 03:18:43.540]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[03:18:43.540 --> 03:18:47.940]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[03:18:47.940 --> 03:18:50.980]  water supply but more importantly a good
[03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:55.860]  water filtration system will purify it we've taken thousands of years of
[03:18:55.860 --> 03:18:58.660]  known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:18:58.660 --> 03:19:02.820]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through
[03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:05.940]  mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:11.060]  z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the usa
[03:19:11.060 --> 03:19:14.420]  it's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:17.940]  absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[03:19:17.940 --> 03:19:22.260]  it is a classical 360 win this is the formula that i personally
[03:19:22.260 --> 03:19:26.180]  have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to
[03:19:26.180 --> 03:19:29.700]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get

[03:19:52.180 --> 03:19:55.460]  and info wars life dot com
[03:19:55.460 --> 03:20:02.340]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:02.340 --> 03:20:27.140]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide
[03:20:27.140 --> 03:20:38.180]  it's alex jones well it's not alex jones exactly it's alex jones show info wars
[03:20:38.180 --> 03:20:41.780]  and this is gerald salenti and what an honor
[03:20:41.780 --> 03:20:48.260]  and privilege to be on info wars and it was talking a lot about the economy
[03:20:48.260 --> 03:20:52.020]  before and rising oil prices and interest rates
[03:20:52.020 --> 03:20:55.780]  so here's just one of the things that i do is a trend forecaster
[03:20:55.780 --> 03:20:59.140]  i still read old newspapers the old print
[03:20:59.140 --> 03:21:05.060]  and what i do is i mark up the salient points of the stories
[03:21:05.060 --> 03:21:10.500]  and there's one here a con faces immediate economic test as pakistan
[03:21:10.500 --> 03:21:17.460]  eyes 12 billion dollar imf bailout and you know what the imf is right the
[03:21:17.460 --> 03:21:22.260]  international mafia federation that the white shoe boys like to call the
[03:21:22.260 --> 03:21:28.420]  international monetary fund but it's of course no fun for anybody
[03:21:28.420 --> 03:21:33.780]  pakistan is drawing up plans to seek its largest ever bailout from the imf
[03:21:33.780 --> 03:21:37.380]  with senior finance officials set to present
[03:21:37.380 --> 03:21:43.620]  the option to imran khan soon after he takes office
[03:21:43.620 --> 03:21:48.100]  and he loaned from the imf which officials believe is necessary
[03:21:48.100 --> 03:21:53.860]  to resolve the country's escalating foreign reserves crisis
[03:21:53.860 --> 03:21:59.460]  would see the fund impose restrictions on public spending
[03:21:59.460 --> 03:22:03.540]  such limits would make it difficult for pakistan's new leader
[03:22:03.540 --> 03:22:07.460]  to fulfill some of his election promises
[03:22:07.460 --> 03:22:12.820]  such as building quote in islamic wealthier state
[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:21.460]  i mentioned this for two reasons again i was talking about the currency crisis
[03:22:21.460 --> 03:22:28.820]  because the stronger the dollar gets the weaker emerging market currencies go
[03:22:28.820 --> 03:22:36.260]  and its foreign currency reserves have declined rapidly in recent months
[03:22:36.260 --> 03:22:44.420]  as ready for this higher oil prices have pushed up the cost of imports
[03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:51.860]  while exports continue to lag that's what i was saying before again
[03:22:51.860 --> 03:22:56.660]  history before it happens we write about these issues and speak about them
[03:22:56.660 --> 03:23:01.620]  before they make the papers this is only one of the emerging markets that's
[03:23:01.620 --> 03:23:06.660]  going to submerge the other point i want to make here is that
[03:23:06.660 --> 03:23:10.260]  they said that it's going to be difficult for the leader to fulfill some
[03:23:10.260 --> 03:23:15.220]  of his election promises so many of these clowns running for
[03:23:15.220 --> 03:23:20.500]  office make these election promises and never fulfill them
[03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:27.620]  but they get away with it how come because they're politicians and i say
[03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:31.780]  google up the definition of politician someone who runs for elected office
[03:23:31.780 --> 03:23:34.420]  blah blah blah the second part a person that's
[03:23:34.420 --> 03:23:37.700]  manipulative and devious typically to gain advancement
[03:23:37.700 --> 03:23:42.660]  within an organization so they'll say anything to get elected
[03:23:42.660 --> 03:23:46.100]  and this guy's been running a long time to do so
[03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:50.980]  i want to stay on this story one more point here many analysts believe
[03:23:50.980 --> 03:23:57.540]  a return to the imf is inevitable and will come with damaging consequences
[03:23:57.540 --> 03:24:04.020]  for economic growth short-term economic growth
[03:24:04.020 --> 03:24:07.540]  yeah guess what take a look at Greece
[03:24:07.540 --> 03:24:14.180]  long-term economic growth and again it's great being on with info wars
[03:24:14.180 --> 03:24:18.740]  and the reason i'm on info wars and i support it is because
[03:24:18.740 --> 03:24:22.980]  it's the truth that people are looking for that you can find in other places
[03:24:22.980 --> 03:24:27.140]  and products that they have that you won't find in many places
[03:24:27.140 --> 03:24:34.180]  either and they're introducing a powerful line of fish oils from info wars
[03:24:34.180 --> 03:24:38.740]  life 25 percent off each bottle
[03:24:38.740 --> 03:24:45.060]  as we used to say in the Bronx bottle and 40 percent off combo
[03:24:45.060 --> 03:24:49.300]  the years fish oils have been one of the most recognized supplements in the
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:53.300]  market and for good reasons studies have suggested
[03:24:53.300 --> 03:24:59.540]  that fish oils and fish oil supplements can decrease the growth rate of plaque
[03:24:59.540 --> 03:25:04.740]  slightly lower blood pressure and prevent cognitive decline
[03:25:04.740 --> 03:25:09.140]  that's why the info wars team work hard to create a series
[03:25:09.140 --> 03:25:13.860]  of fish oils to help you boost your mind and body
[03:25:13.860 --> 03:25:20.260]  with unlimited fish oil ultimate fish oil excuse me ultimate krill oil
[03:25:20.260 --> 03:25:26.100]  an honor roll added to you and your child's daily supplement routine
[03:25:26.100 --> 03:25:30.900]  you could take advantage of the true power of fish oils
[03:25:30.900 --> 03:25:38.420]  and remember 25 percent off each bottle 40 percent off the combo
[03:25:38.420 --> 03:25:43.860]  so i'm gonna stay on these emerging markets because all things are connected
[03:25:43.860 --> 03:25:47.700]  and what could bring the economy back in a way
[03:25:47.700 --> 03:25:51.220]  and what could bring strength back in a way
[03:25:51.220 --> 03:25:56.500]  that we haven't seen before well here's a forecast i'm going to make
[03:25:56.500 --> 03:26:02.580]  and you're the first to hear it there's a major story today
[03:26:02.580 --> 03:26:07.540]  here in the wall street journal
[03:26:07.940 --> 03:26:16.820]  in afghanistan us sees signs of peace
[03:26:16.820 --> 03:26:25.060]  there it is when have you read a headline like this before about afghanistan
[03:26:25.060 --> 03:26:33.220]  i believe peace is on the horizon today trump is fulfilled
[03:26:33.220 --> 03:26:39.060]  two of the three issues that he said he was going to talk about
[03:26:39.060 --> 03:26:44.100]  but that he did talk about big issues during his campaign
[03:26:44.100 --> 03:26:50.420]  one was to renegotiate the trade deals which he's doing
[03:26:51.060 --> 03:26:57.060]  another one was tax cuts and that's why we said
[03:26:57.060 --> 03:27:01.380]  there's going to be a trump rally because we know what the tax cuts do
[03:27:01.380 --> 03:27:05.460]  a lot of the money goes into stock buybacks we're realists
[03:27:05.460 --> 03:27:08.820]  and you're looking at stock buyback and merger and acquisition activity
[03:27:08.820 --> 03:27:13.860]  this part of the term of the year at record levels
[03:27:13.860 --> 03:27:18.580]  and number three he promised to rebuild the infrastructure
[03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:24.820]  that hasn't happened yet and his proposals to do so are very weak
[03:27:24.820 --> 03:27:32.180]  here is the trend trump is going to follow gerald salentes
[03:27:32.180 --> 03:27:37.860]  occupied peace plan in bringing the troops home
[03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:45.220]  closing unnecessary bases overseas and put them to work rebuilding
[03:27:45.220 --> 03:27:51.300]  our rotted infrastructure it is one of the elements the second element
[03:27:51.300 --> 03:27:57.860]  of my occupied peace program once upon a time in the 1930s there was the work
[03:27:57.860 --> 03:28:01.620]  progress administration huva dam all these places they put the
[03:28:01.620 --> 03:28:05.380]  people to work rebuilding our country and building it
[03:28:05.380 --> 03:28:11.460]  a troops progress administration that's what you're going to see
[03:28:11.460 --> 03:28:16.980]  that's our forecast you heard it first the troops are going to come back

[03:33:47.060 --> 03:33:50.980]  live from uptown kingston new york where the seeds of democracy was
[03:33:50.980 --> 03:33:56.420]  sewn that's right right over here the four corners the only place in the usa
[03:33:56.420 --> 03:34:01.140]  with three pre-revolutionary war stone buildings on each corner
[03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:11.940]  the 1750 1691 1774 and 1763 actually the foundation of the 1763 one
[03:34:11.940 --> 03:34:16.820]  goes back to pre 1700s that was burnt down the british burnt down the joint
[03:34:16.820 --> 03:34:21.700]  back in 1777 that's when they moved this from the first capital of new york
[03:34:21.700 --> 03:34:25.140]  state they moved it up to albany after the british burnt it down
[03:34:25.140 --> 03:34:29.140]  so the seeds of democracy was sewn here so i'm honored to be on
[03:34:29.140 --> 03:34:32.980]  with alex jones because i am a true american
[03:34:32.980 --> 03:34:38.900]  i'm an american firster at all levels when you talk about trade and tariffs
[03:34:38.900 --> 03:34:43.380]  i'm all for them i want a made in america country
[03:34:43.380 --> 03:34:47.700]  yeah i want to buy you know some nice prosciutto from italy or some fine wine
[03:34:47.700 --> 03:34:51.940]  from france you know luxury items sure why not
[03:34:51.940 --> 03:35:00.260]  but how about a country that now imports 97 percent of its shoes and clothing
[03:35:00.260 --> 03:35:03.780]  and foreign nations made by slave labor so
[03:35:03.780 --> 03:35:09.380]  multinationals can make more money i believe in a self-sustaining economy
[03:35:09.380 --> 03:35:14.340]  i believe we have everything we need to make it here and to make it ourselves
[03:35:14.340 --> 03:35:18.500]  and remember as a young man when there were places that used to make shoes and
[03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:22.180]  shirts mills or remember the gomin district down in
[03:35:22.180 --> 03:35:26.020]  new york my picture of my aunt zizi over there for
[03:35:26.020 --> 03:35:30.580]  my book with zizi gave honey boy you know so rest in peace
[03:35:30.580 --> 03:35:37.300]  she used to do piecework at gomin factory and she used to tell me how she
[03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:40.980]  hands are really really quick and they got paid by the number of pieces and
[03:35:40.980 --> 03:35:45.780]  then after she did enough then she'd go over down to time square and
[03:35:45.780 --> 03:35:49.860]  and listen to benny goodman back in the big band days
[03:35:49.860 --> 03:35:53.220]  and i want to mention that as well because a lot has a lot to do with it
[03:35:53.220 --> 03:35:57.620]  think of it the big band era the 1930s the great
[03:35:57.620 --> 03:36:01.060]  depression americans down and out man who
[03:36:01.060 --> 03:36:05.300]  great recession forget about it you take a look at the great depression now
[03:36:05.300 --> 03:36:10.020]  we're really talking misery and look at the old photos of people
[03:36:10.020 --> 03:36:15.460]  all dressed to the nines right and the music is swinging
[03:36:15.460 --> 03:36:19.860]  you know it's happy days a year again you know
[03:36:19.860 --> 03:36:24.820]  leave your troubles by the doorstep and go to the sunny side of the street
[03:36:24.820 --> 03:36:30.820]  one song uplifting after another what was different about then and now
[03:36:30.820 --> 03:36:35.140]  well a lot of things but one big thing goes back to
[03:36:35.140 --> 03:36:40.340]  the story that i showed you in afghanistan
[03:36:40.340 --> 03:36:50.820]  usc signs of peace peace there was no war going on in the 1930s in america
[03:36:50.820 --> 03:36:58.740]  you weren't involved in anything you can't have joy and beauty and creativity
[03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:03.940]  at high levels if there's fear and terror running constantly
[03:37:03.940 --> 03:37:09.540]  there's on info wars site earlier today and i saw how the little freaks at the
[03:37:09.540 --> 03:37:13.060]  tsa that love to feel you up and pat you down
[03:37:13.060 --> 03:37:16.500]  old ladies little kids yeah you don't know if they gotta
[03:37:16.500 --> 03:37:19.700]  they got a thing in there that's gonna blow them but the plane up
[03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:26.100]  you know grow up what are you doing and now we're finding out
[03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:31.380]  that they take us randomly and to see who we are what we're doing where we're
[03:37:31.380 --> 03:37:39.700]  traveling fear and terror everywhere how can you have creativity you can't
[03:37:39.700 --> 03:37:43.140]  and that's why you don't have it man it's just one
[03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:49.940]  bad rap it's gone that's why i'm a proponent for
[03:37:49.940 --> 03:37:54.820]  peace occupied peace dot com and what we're going to be doing in
[03:37:54.820 --> 03:37:59.300]  the future is launching occupied peace festivals music arts
[03:37:59.300 --> 03:38:03.620]  crafts vendors that's our vision to restore peace
[03:38:03.620 --> 03:38:08.740]  with prosperity going back to this story again you're hearing it first on
[03:38:08.740 --> 03:38:17.300]  info wars we saved it for you trump is going to
[03:38:17.300 --> 03:38:20.900]  bring peace in afghanistan he did not want
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:27.860]  to bring in four thousand more troops according to the reports
[03:38:27.860 --> 03:38:33.620]  but he did and you should remember during his campaign
[03:38:33.620 --> 03:38:40.420]  he said he wanted to end the afghan war think about it united states
[03:38:40.420 --> 03:38:46.660]  states spent more money rebuilding the bombed out afghan
[03:38:46.660 --> 03:38:50.260]  infrastructure that we the people paid for to get bombed out
[03:38:50.260 --> 03:38:55.780]  that we the people also paid the military industrial complex to repair
[03:38:55.780 --> 03:39:01.380]  we spent more money when adjusted for inflation rebuilding afghanistan
[03:39:01.380 --> 03:39:07.940]  and we did with the marshal plan after world war two
[03:39:08.660 --> 03:39:15.460]  so i forecast that trump is going to take
[03:39:15.860 --> 03:39:20.020]  the second part of our action plan for occupy peace is a four
[03:39:20.020 --> 03:39:27.860]  point action plan number one on the founding fathers bring home the troops
[03:39:27.860 --> 03:39:31.700]  no foreign entanglements secure the homeland
[03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:38.820]  number two put the troops to work rebuilding our rotted infrastructure
[03:39:38.820 --> 03:39:47.780]  the troops progress administration the tpa the 2.0 version of the works
[03:39:47.780 --> 03:39:53.620]  progress administration of the great depression
[03:39:53.620 --> 03:39:57.540]  the third element by the way is to force congress to vote to go to war anytime
[03:39:57.540 --> 03:40:01.620]  we go into foreign countries which they have violated the constitution and
[03:40:01.620 --> 03:40:08.260]  have not done since let's say world war two and
[03:40:08.260 --> 03:40:11.780]  finally a referendum on each state ballot where we the people
[03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:15.780]  will tell congress how to vote because we're the ones that paid for the war
[03:40:15.780 --> 03:40:20.340]  without money in our lives oh and by the way on august 18th
[03:40:20.340 --> 03:40:24.500]  i'll be down in washington dc and i have the great honor
[03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:28.260]  and great privilege for being one of the speakers
[03:40:28.260 --> 03:40:36.100]  at ron paul's conference coming up on august 18th in washington dc
[03:40:36.100 --> 03:40:41.300]  so please if you could make it come on down and we're going to talk about
[03:40:41.300 --> 03:40:45.700]  the media how it's controlled how they sell war
[03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:51.220]  and about freedom peace and prosperity because you know as an older cat that's
[03:40:51.220 --> 03:40:54.580]  been around a while i like to check out creating
[03:40:54.580 --> 03:40:59.700]  peace that's my vision for the future so going back to what trump is doing in
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:02.420]  afghanistan we believe he's going to do the same
[03:41:02.420 --> 03:41:05.220]  thing in syria we believe they're going to do the
[03:41:05.220 --> 03:41:09.540]  same thing with south korea bringing home the troops one country
[03:41:09.540 --> 03:41:16.340]  after another and giving the troops real skills they can use
[03:41:16.340 --> 03:41:23.460]  after they leave the service rather than waging wars by rebuilding our
[03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:29.060]  infrastructure and bringing it into the 21st century
[03:41:29.060 --> 03:41:35.380]  and again if you want peace and prosperity as well and truth and freedom

[03:42:38.900 --> 03:42:43.940]  very shortly with the troops coming home and rebuilding america

[03:47:55.380 --> 03:47:58.900]  forget when it happened when the old jay simpson story hit
[03:47:58.900 --> 03:48:02.660]  i remember i was on the show called 48 hours on cbs
[03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:06.820]  and after they filmed it i said what's going on with this coverage
[03:48:06.820 --> 03:48:11.940]  it's every day you know and you look at the newspapers today
[03:48:11.940 --> 03:48:14.580]  and they're a shadow of what they used to be
[03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:20.340]  i mean here's the toilet paper record the new york times and i read everything
[03:48:20.340 --> 03:48:24.260]  i want to get everybody's viewpoint but look at all the photos here
[03:48:24.260 --> 03:48:28.420]  you look at the old new york times with story after story after story after
[03:48:28.420 --> 03:48:34.020]  story and now all they are is photos after photos after photos after photos

[03:48:41.780 --> 03:48:46.340]  so you're getting very few stories and what you're getting
[03:48:46.340 --> 03:48:51.700]  is really not worth very much money after three decades she's turning in her
