[00:00.000 --> 00:29.640]  We are now in the final days, the final hours of the incredibly
[00:29.640 --> 00:48.160]  insane year of 2022. We are now rushing into the year 2023. The great reset and the attempt
[00:48.160 --> 00:56.400]  to have the organized, forced depopulation of humans on planet Earth as the globalist
[00:56.400 --> 01:05.400]  attempt to complete our quest for total world government, advanced technology and eventual
[01:05.400 --> 01:12.760]  immortality. Bad scientists playing God who were destined to destroy themselves and if we
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.920]  don't stand up and fight back, us right along with them. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:17.920 --> 01:25.880]  All right, yesterday we took some calls and covered some news, but I was a little bit out of it,
[01:25.880 --> 01:32.440]  Cedar, that I'm very allergic to, had hit in the last few days and I had not taken any allergy
[01:32.440 --> 01:37.640]  medication or my pollen block and had a pretty big headache on air, could have just gone off
[01:37.640 --> 01:42.400]  air but stayed on air. We ended up doing a decent show yesterday, but I feel a lot better today.
[01:42.400 --> 01:48.640]  I might sneeze, but other than that I am in the saddle, I am focused, I am ready to lay out the
[01:48.640 --> 01:55.720]  enemy's operations and I literally have over a hundred articles and videos and documents on
[01:55.720 --> 02:02.800]  Agenda 2030 and its official rollout of locking the cities down and the climate lockdown. So
[02:02.800 --> 02:10.120]  what I'm going to do is hit some of the national news, the economy news, what's happening with
[02:10.120 --> 02:17.240]  the airlines, the latest on FTX and more, the latest January 6 information. I'll do that the
[02:17.240 --> 02:23.200]  first few segments after this. At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to drill deeply into the
[02:23.200 --> 02:32.120]  operational phase of locking us down inside the towns and cities we live in with total surveillance,
[02:32.120 --> 02:38.680]  what's now unfolding across the world and how we stop it, Klaus Schwab bragging about it decades
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.280]  ago. More and more videos of him are now surfacing how long they've been planning this total
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.160]  takeover of every facet of human civilization to then carry out their in-game of forced
[02:48.160 --> 02:53.120]  depopulation. But first I thought I'd play a short clip. A political activist, Chris Sky,
[02:53.120 --> 02:59.200]  who in just two minutes knocks it out of the park describing these so-called 15-minute cities. Here
[02:59.200 --> 03:07.360]  it is. The gray reset is moving along so quickly. The World Economic Forum is now advertising their
[03:07.360 --> 03:13.920]  brand new initiative, 15-minute cities. Oh, what does that mean? That means everything you're going
[03:13.920 --> 03:20.880]  to need to live, work, survive is going to be within a 15-minute walk of where you live because
[03:20.880 --> 03:26.000]  you're not going to be able to have a car. You're not going to have the time or money to go further
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.640]  away from your home and they want you to be confined to that 15-minute area from where you live
[03:32.640 --> 03:39.040]  for virtually your entire life. I'm going to send you a video about how wonderful this is and I'll
[03:39.040 --> 03:44.080]  send you to the website that explains to you. They actually have like seven different websites set
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.960]  up to explain all the different aspects of this and how amazing it's going to be for you. This is
[03:48.960 --> 03:57.120]  literally, literally the you will own nothing and be happy gray reset where you literally live in a
[03:57.120 --> 04:03.680]  little building and you don't get to leave your building for 99% of your life and you're going
[04:03.680 --> 04:10.240]  to stay on that same block for 99% of your life. And once they get you like that, international
[04:10.240 --> 04:16.240]  travel, all the things that you used to enjoy, those are going to be a pipe dream. The little peasants
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.920]  like you, you're not going to be able to enjoy that kind of stuff. You're going to be living in
[04:19.920 --> 04:25.040]  your 15-minute city. You're going to be making no money. You're going to be riding the bicycle that
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.480]  you're renting from the government and your life is going to suck so bad you're probably going to
[04:30.480 --> 04:34.880]  wish you were dead and you're not going to be able to say anything about it because if you talk shit
[04:34.880 --> 04:40.320]  then they'll just take away the little that you already do have just like they're doing in China
[04:40.320 --> 04:46.480]  and you'll be fucked. So 15-minute cities. This is what I've been warning you guys about for years
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.360]  and years and years and here it is with all the wonderful propaganda to tell you how amazing it's
[04:51.360 --> 04:58.400]  going to make your lives. 15-minute cities. Another name for prisons. We'll be right back with all
[04:58.400 --> 05:08.240]  their secrets. I want you to remember two words. Info Wars Platinum. In the history of Info Wars

[06:00.960 --> 06:16.080]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.560 --> 06:28.160]  It's Thursday December 29th 2022 the last final hours and days of this insane year.
[06:28.160 --> 06:35.680]  All right here's what's going down. We're gonna open the phones up today in the second and third
[06:35.680 --> 06:42.080]  hour. We're gonna take a lot of calls on some particular subjects I'm gonna throw out and
[06:42.080 --> 06:49.520]  again we're gonna take first-time callers here today. We have a particularly informative and
[06:49.520 --> 06:55.760]  quite frankly horrifying trawl of globalist developments and activities today so let me
[06:55.760 --> 07:01.120]  just tell you what's coming up. Bottom of the hour you see these hundred plus articles right here
[07:02.000 --> 07:09.040]  each one of these I could spend a whole hour on but instead we're gonna give me the big data dump
[07:09.040 --> 07:16.160]  and go through all of them in just 30 minutes coming up in about 25 minutes and it is important
[07:16.160 --> 07:23.840]  because it is not on the drawing board anymore it is not globalist academic theorem and blueprints
[07:23.840 --> 07:32.640]  it is actual operationals. The war is on against humanity it is spectacular. I'm gonna deep dive
[07:32.640 --> 07:37.600]  on this because a lot of listeners in the last few weeks have been saying why aren't you covering
[07:37.600 --> 07:42.160]  15-minute cities and they're planned to lock down cities and they're planned to make you have a
[07:43.680 --> 07:48.960]  vaccine passport on your phone being announced by the UN worldwide. Why aren't I covering it?
[07:49.520 --> 07:52.640]  It's like when I get calls sometimes saying why don't you talk about the federal reserve being
[07:52.640 --> 08:00.320]  private. I just made films and wrote books about it. I cover it at Nauseum and yes in my first film
[08:00.320 --> 08:07.680]  in 2000s first film on the New World Order Total Takeover would be 2007 but in my actual first film
[08:08.480 --> 08:18.560]  which is on the UN World Government Takeover 2001-2003-2005 I mean I made a bunch of films but
[08:18.560 --> 08:28.400]  my first film was in 1997 America Destroyed by Design but it is true that it's a big hot topic
[08:28.400 --> 08:38.960]  now 15-minute cities that's the name of the UNWEF Larry Fink Black Rock rollout of this
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.680]  where they're actually going operational so we're going to be looking at all of that
[08:43.680 --> 08:52.480]  coming up at the bottom of the hour and the latest developments there then of course we're
[08:52.480 --> 08:58.000]  going to hit this first here in a moment the major university studies and governmental studies are
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.680]  pouring out confirming what we told you almost three years ago the so-called experimental shot
[09:03.680 --> 09:09.120]  would do before they announced the experimental shot because we knew that they already tested on rats
[09:09.120 --> 09:16.480]  the University of Texas under Fauci's control under Obama so we knew exactly what the play would be
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.040]  before it was even announced and we said it'll erase your immune system that was the whole
[09:21.040 --> 09:28.480]  business model well now it's major major studies out of major universities and organizations
[09:29.280 --> 09:35.440]  confirming and even government watchdog groups even major organizations and government are
[09:35.440 --> 09:41.760]  coming out saying don't take the COVID shots well it's a little too late for that for four
[09:42.560 --> 09:53.520]  billion people that got scared or bullied or forced into it absolutely insane so we've got
[09:53.520 --> 09:59.120]  that giant stack and we've got Benjamin yet in Yahoo I didn't know he'd gone on Jordan Peterson's
[09:59.120 --> 10:07.920]  show and talked about how the whole country of Israel are guinea pigs and how lucky they are
[10:07.920 --> 10:14.480]  that Israel was basically forced to take the injection and how wonderful it all is so I
[10:14.480 --> 10:23.680]  guess Benjamin yet in Yahoo is now who's just been reelected in the Knesset to be the head of Israel
[10:23.680 --> 10:33.040]  I guess he's the closest thing Israel seen since it was founded Joseph Mengele and I'm not even an
[10:33.040 --> 10:39.520]  anti Benjamin yet in Yahoo person but you got to be against this stuff just like I love Trump but
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.640]  I mean come on he's still promoting the poison shot and I just can't can't be involved in it
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.840]  so shame on Benjamin yet in Yahoo because Trump didn't do forced injections Trump
[10:49.840 --> 10:57.200]  didn't push half as far as yet in Yahoo or or or Biden is and it's disgusting
[10:59.040 --> 11:04.880]  absolutely disgusting so that clips coming up start of the next segment we'll get all that news
[11:06.080 --> 11:12.400]  folks are digging up plow swab clips not just recent ones but old ones from 5 10 15
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.400]  20 years ago we've got quite the collection of new ones here that I've never seen
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.840]  I'd read the globalist policy reports where they admitted all this but man it's incredible
[11:22.720 --> 11:30.000]  some of these quotes are just amazing he said that the WEF is taking over all the major educational
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.560]  systems of the world with major corporate funding of from folks like BlackRock show that we can
[11:36.560 --> 11:43.520]  introduce and indoctrinate the children with our ideology at an early age which is the transhumanist
[11:43.520 --> 11:51.120]  eugenics radical environmentalist death cult operation funded by the big corporations that's
[11:51.120 --> 11:59.200]  just one of the clips old class swab at the WEF is going viral for a clip where he talks about
[11:59.840 --> 12:10.000]  revolutionizing education by indoctrinating the children into the WEF's ideology this is an old
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.480]  clip but he talks about with the United Nations well four months ago the UN had a big vote of the
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.280]  secretariat and not of the general UN but the actual dictatorship partially runs it
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.120]  like the EU has an elected parliament that's ceremonial but then they have the actual
[12:27.120 --> 12:35.280]  unelected EU it's been operating since 1957 the Treaty of Rome and they say in there
[12:35.280 --> 12:41.760]  that they're establishing a dictatorial system and here is Klaus Schwab
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.560]  admitting all of that but four months ago they had a vote and
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.480]  the WEF I don't like the WEF that people tell you it's just you know just guys having a
[12:56.480 --> 13:05.520]  conference at a hotel they don't have any power yeah right as they set world policy that the WEF merged
[13:06.240 --> 13:13.840]  with the UN secretariat and the UN Security Council and is governmental now and is co-equal
[13:13.840 --> 13:22.000]  to them so quite the big deal on that front and then we've got lots of other interesting news here
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.720]  a alleged crypto fraudster Sam bankman freed is given judge who oversaw Jeffrey Epstein case
[13:29.280 --> 13:34.800]  and let Kevin Spacey walk so he's got Jeffrey Epstein and Gisela Maxwell's lawyer
[13:35.840 --> 13:42.960]  he's got the same judge notice how all this works and he's walking free and it gets more
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.920]  interesting after that but we should just let these type of folks give us digital currency where
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.560]  they can watch everything we do and control what we can buy and sell and devalue our currency anytime
[13:52.560 --> 14:00.240]  they want let's give this crew this mafia total control over our lives i'm sure it's a great idea
[14:00.800 --> 14:04.800]  and he was working with his mommy and federal regulators to create that global currency
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.920]  federal prosecutors aren't too worried about that though they're busy investigating representative
[14:11.920 --> 14:19.120]  elect george santos who told 1 100 the lies of biden and i'm not defending santos but all the
[14:19.120 --> 14:26.160]  republicans feeling good about themselves trying to bring down santos but you just can't seem to
[14:26.160 --> 14:31.760]  muster any energy to go after the democrats because well you know that that's just accepted
[14:31.760 --> 14:37.600]  they're corrupt but we can all feel good about ourselves come on for this guy meanwhile emails
[14:37.600 --> 14:43.600]  reveal sam bankman freed's courtship of federal regulators la times yeah he was buying them off
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.480]  because they set him up to run the scam sec announces departure of dan berkovitz
[14:49.040 --> 15:00.320]  megan barbara named general counsel all because of their involvements with fdx so we're going to
[15:00.320 --> 15:07.440]  be looking at all of that coming up we also have governor santos sending a warning letter
[15:07.440 --> 15:15.440]  that topless bars aren't allowed to have children as part of the shows and neither can the pedo
[15:15.440 --> 15:22.320]  networks and so drag queen christmas time a pedo time event they're saying they'll be arrested
[15:22.320 --> 15:28.640]  if they try to take their clothes off in front of children which i absolutely agree with i don't
[15:28.640 --> 15:33.920]  care if you're dancing in front of heterosexuals or homosexuals if they're trying to sexualize
[15:33.920 --> 15:42.320]  children i say put them in handcuffs and if they're a convicted pedophile that rapes a child
[15:43.680 --> 15:50.640]  i say they need to be executed and i'll be happy with the executioner once they're convicted if
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.200]  you want me to pull the lever the lethal injection time to start protecting our children will be right

[20:31.760 --> 20:35.280]  and i just so happened to come across a clip of him from a few weeks ago that i hadn't seen
[20:35.920 --> 20:42.000]  we went on jordan peterson's podcast we'll play a clip in a moment and it's only two minutes long
[20:42.960 --> 20:48.800]  and it's filled with lies he says israel has this national ID card that tracks everything our
[20:48.800 --> 20:54.560]  citizens do health wise that's true but he says that way we could you know make sure it was safe
[20:54.560 --> 20:59.600]  that way we could track what it was going to do that way we would know what the health effects of
[20:59.600 --> 21:04.960]  the shot were but they've used that database and the claims of that database being there
[21:04.960 --> 21:10.640]  as the pretext to say then later that it was totally safe when israel had the worst adverse
[21:10.640 --> 21:18.720]  reactions of any country in the world look it up we've shown the statistics from the un from israel
[21:18.720 --> 21:24.800]  from the united states from canada from them all israel had amongst the highest injection
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.320]  rates of the so-called shot in the world that was experimental and doesn't protect you
[21:30.320 --> 21:37.040]  and erases your immune system and it is a huge huge controversy in israel and the israelis
[21:37.040 --> 21:41.280]  are pissed off and rightfully so because there they are locked in that country
[21:43.920 --> 21:47.600]  and remember the government tried to roll out vaccine passports tried to say it was forced
[21:47.600 --> 21:51.600]  tried to make people take it i was telling you at the time it'll be one two three four five
[21:51.600 --> 21:56.400]  six seven shots a year because bill gates had said it two and a half years ago that you'll have to
[21:56.400 --> 22:02.240]  have these on a routine basis basis because it'll lower your immune system bill gates said that
[22:05.040 --> 22:09.360]  scientists at feiser and maderna said that they giggled and laughed and said the stock's
[22:09.360 --> 22:13.600]  going to go way up because you're always going to have to take this now and the more you take it
[22:13.600 --> 22:25.600]  the more you get sick and then there's benjamin yet nyahu saying i used my country like a lab
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.760]  experiment meaning he used the israeli people the jewish people that live there and the christians
[22:31.760 --> 22:39.440]  and the muslims and others as a lab experiment well i'm not a lab experiment and people in israel
[22:39.440 --> 22:44.560]  are a lab experiment and when this was done to black people was to ski it was illegal and what
[22:44.560 --> 22:48.480]  was done here and when our troops were made to take it the federal courts have ruled that was
[22:48.480 --> 22:52.960]  illegal because you can't make troops take an experimental shot show what our government did
[22:52.960 --> 22:58.000]  was illegal what the israeli government did was illegal what the uk government's done is illegal
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.720]  what the australian and canadian and german government and all the rest of them have done
[23:02.720 --> 23:11.120]  is absolutely illegal and they used israel like china as a beta test of lab rats to not just
[23:11.120 --> 23:18.320]  give them the poison shot but to track everybody and demand protest and to attack the orthodox and
[23:18.320 --> 23:24.880]  ultra orthodox jewish groups that are smart and we're following leviticus and said we're
[23:24.880 --> 23:36.080]  here not taking that in to our bodies so shame on benjamin yet and yahoo and shame on the evil
[23:36.080 --> 23:42.000]  leaders of israel that went along with this and use their people that believe they're there for
[23:42.000 --> 23:50.000]  their protection and safety that have come there fleeing persecution in many cases to only be
[23:50.000 --> 23:58.560]  persecuted at an even greater level than what joseph mingola did joseph mingola reportedly
[23:58.560 --> 24:03.360]  did test on over 50 000 people killed more than 10 000 he's known as the angel of death
[24:03.360 --> 24:07.920]  how many israeli's got forcibly injected or intimidated into it how many got sick and died
[24:07.920 --> 24:17.360]  how many are sick and dying now so the test sites were israel italy singapore australia
[24:17.360 --> 24:26.560]  new zealand communist china and that's all this was was a giant exercise in tyranny the israeli
[24:26.560 --> 24:32.480]  people and the people of the world are all being targeted by the same global world government
[24:32.480 --> 24:39.360]  operation with albert bordela and bill gates the head of it and benjamin yet and yahoo
[24:39.360 --> 24:47.520]  is nothing but their little pimp here's the club the epidemic or how how would you foresee the
[24:47.520 --> 24:55.440]  future hey guys one example that's that's stop stop stop clip that's claus schrub i want to
[24:55.440 --> 25:04.480]  play the benjamin yet and yahoo club with him on jordan peterson show we have a club
[25:04.480 --> 25:11.520]  okay go ahead play that one example so you'll see because i don't want to bore you with the
[25:12.080 --> 25:20.160]  detailed detailed plans i but they are detailed in my mind um we came out of coven first i
[25:20.160 --> 25:25.280]  described that in my book my conversations with albert bordela feiser and i persuaded him to give
[25:25.280 --> 25:31.600]  tiny israel uh then the necessary vaccines to get us out first from the coven and the reason
[25:31.600 --> 25:38.800]  i could do that is because we have a database 98 percent a medical database 98 percent of our
[25:38.800 --> 25:45.120]  population has digitized medical records and rule card and anywhere you go in any hospital in israel
[25:45.120 --> 25:49.840]  north south doesn't make any difference boom you punch it in and you know everything about this
[25:49.840 --> 25:56.000]  patient for the last 20 years i said we'll use that to tell you whether these vaccines what do
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.960]  they do to people not individual people not with their individual identities but statistically
[26:00.960 --> 26:07.040]  what does it do to people with uh you know with the meningitis what does it do to people with
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.080]  high blood pressure what is it you know you want to know that so israel became if you will the the
[26:12.080 --> 26:17.920]  lab for feiser and that's how we did it we got out that we gave the information to the world not
[26:17.920 --> 26:25.680]  only been published in medical magazines and so on um that's a database we have i intend to bring
[26:25.680 --> 26:33.120]  on that base database of medical personal medical records for entire population a genetic database
[26:33.120 --> 26:39.760]  genomes okay give me a saliva sample volunteer but i'm sure most people would do it maybe we'll
[26:39.760 --> 26:47.520]  pay them now we have a genetic record on a medical record of a robust population it's got you have
[26:47.520 --> 26:52.800]  to have diversified populations we have people from a hundred lands this is a very powerful
[26:52.800 --> 27:01.840]  engine now now let uh pharma companies let medical companies let them run algorithms on this database
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.400]  okay i'm telling you right away that i'll give preference for a few years to israeli firms
[27:06.960 --> 27:13.360]  but you can create and then to the world but you can create uh you know a biotechnological
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.080]  industry that is unheard of right now unheard of unimagined even uh and these are just the
[27:20.080 --> 27:29.360]  examples we can become a lot stay off iran become a light unto the nations in uh groundbreaking a light
[27:30.560 --> 27:41.120]  unto the nations by using the people in israel the jews the christians the muslims as guinea pigs
[27:41.120 --> 27:48.240]  under forced injections lockdowns with a genetic database to see what the mutinogenic injections
[27:48.240 --> 27:55.360]  do to the host body and of course a lot of the big companies that are pushing all this
[27:55.360 --> 28:01.680]  or base in israel so they're sacrificing that population to set the precedent to be able to test
[28:02.560 --> 28:08.720]  gmo deadly gene therapies on the public so the elites can actually get some of the breakthroughs
[28:08.720 --> 28:14.320]  for themselves while testing on humans instead of testing on rats and pigs and other animals
[28:14.320 --> 28:21.040]  and that's just evil out in the open calmly said very cavalierly very proud of what he's done
[28:22.400 --> 28:28.880]  and they're all just doubling down albert borla bill gates you know in fact i'm going to continue
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.680]  along this line i've got an albert borla clip talking about the four shots you're going to be
[28:33.680 --> 28:41.440]  made to take every year and we got bill gates's 2023 announcement retosu was coming in the future
[28:41.440 --> 28:47.200]  and then i'm going to get into the lockdown of the cities and the climate lockdowns that they're
[28:47.200 --> 28:53.280]  now calling 15 minute cities or 15 minute prisons that they'll have actual fences and gates around

[33:19.280 --> 33:26.080]  you have to expect prolongation of the pandemic or at least the epidemic or
[33:26.080 --> 33:33.120]  or how would you foresee the future yes or do we have to and may immediately ask a second question
[33:34.160 --> 33:42.400]  should we be afraid of another virus and what does it mean how we create the necessary resilience
[33:42.400 --> 33:49.440]  personally nationally globally on the first question i don't think that the virus will
[33:49.440 --> 33:54.880]  disappear we are not certain about it but most scientists agree that the virus will be around
[33:54.880 --> 34:01.120]  forever but the real question that everybody's asking is not this it is can we get our lives back
[34:01.760 --> 34:07.360]  can we live normal can normal economic activity normal social activity with a virus presence
[34:07.360 --> 34:13.920]  and the answer is yes i think we can absent a variant that we are not had not foreseen right
[34:13.920 --> 34:19.920]  now that can happen but it is not the most likely scenario i think we have the means right now
[34:19.920 --> 34:27.840]  now very effective vaccines as the various as the very as the virus mutates we have the ability
[34:27.840 --> 34:35.520]  to follow up and let's say update the vaccines and to have treatments without people should not die
[34:35.520 --> 34:43.440]  anymore even if we are not following the way that we are following the the social measures in the
[34:43.440 --> 34:51.360]  past now on the second question shall we are afraid of a new very different virus that would come
[34:51.360 --> 34:57.840]  and to have now all these examples with the monkeypox i don't think we should be afraid but i think
[34:57.840 --> 35:03.600]  we should be prepared and that should even the little fear that we have we should that should
[35:03.600 --> 35:13.360]  easy and if we are prepared i think science will win now some people may argue you have now says
[35:13.360 --> 35:20.160]  new treatments some people may argue why should i get vaccinated if there is a treatment or how
[35:20.160 --> 35:26.640]  would you respond because i think the goal is not for you to get sick and then treat you the goal
[35:26.640 --> 35:33.600]  is to prevent the sickness and that will maximize your chances to do well it's a long clip they go
[35:33.600 --> 35:40.240]  on for 45 minutes telling lie after lie after lie if you just joined us about 10 minutes ago we played
[35:40.240 --> 35:48.160]  Benjamin yet in yahoo who just got reelected to be the leader of israel saying oh they made the
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.480]  decision with albert borla the head of fizer you just heard speaking with claus robb that we would
[35:52.480 --> 35:58.240]  use the israeli population and others that live there as guinea pigs as the new science center
[35:58.240 --> 36:03.920]  of the world making people take experimental shots to see how these shots affect them well they
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.240]  already knew from rat studies what these shots would do they'd cause blood clots heart attacks
[36:08.240 --> 36:15.600]  and more we've gone over that at nauseam but now there are more studies out this from peter a macula
[36:15.600 --> 36:21.600]  md more evidence that frequent repeated failed boosters is weakening the immune system many
[36:21.600 --> 36:27.760]  reasons to get off the train recover and let natural immune system do its job and this is the
[36:28.400 --> 36:35.840]  chong queen medical university study current cuba 19 booster is erasing the human immune system
[36:35.840 --> 36:41.120]  um extended stars cuba 2 r b d booster vaccination induces
[36:42.640 --> 36:49.680]  humoral and cellular immune tolerance in mice meaning the immune system gets turned off oh and
[36:49.680 --> 36:53.920]  you know what happens when that happens you get cancer amongst other things here's the actual
[36:53.920 --> 37:02.800]  medical university study in current study of the vaccines the art vaccines meanwhile new yorker
[37:02.800 --> 37:09.600]  magazine just came out and said the case for wearing mask forever despite the fact that all
[37:09.600 --> 37:14.640]  the government and private studies show that masks do absolutely nothing pop white house cuba
[37:14.640 --> 37:21.920]  advisor dr jaw finally admits on the record on the zoom call that there's no study in the world
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.440]  that shows that masks work back to that clip up we're going to play that clip here in just a moment
[37:29.440 --> 37:42.160]  so all we're told is lie after lie after lie by these people and then i've got some astounding clips
[37:44.240 --> 37:51.600]  out of japan that are just incredible they're subtitled they're up on info wars dot com
[37:52.240 --> 37:58.880]  but two major medical university heads have done their own studies of people that have been taking
[37:58.880 --> 38:06.240]  the shots in japan and have confirmed quote taking the shot moderna phyzer j and jara astrazeneca
[38:08.080 --> 38:15.360]  makes you more susceptible to getting sick catching the virus and dying which we already
[38:15.360 --> 38:21.760]  know but now that's japan there's a headline the dam is breaking in japan two more professors
[38:21.760 --> 38:30.800]  speaking out against the vaccine professor manaka nago from harashima university school of medicine
[38:30.800 --> 38:37.360]  we believe the vaccine is related to immune abnormalities there's a bunch of other professors
[38:37.360 --> 38:43.280]  also including two heads of the medical schools saying things just as serious saying the same
[38:43.280 --> 38:49.280]  things uh basically and we've got these headlines something weird's happening with birth rates in
[38:49.280 --> 38:54.960]  all the countries that took the shots they're the lowest ever recorded falling off a cliff just two
[38:54.960 --> 39:02.960]  years ago exactly with the shots and one of the cdc documents in october 2000 say infertility as well
[39:02.960 --> 39:10.160]  but it's okay because benjamin yahu says you're just lab rats and that's just the way it is and
[39:10.160 --> 39:20.240]  israel's taking the lead making their people lab rats so that they will submit let's play that
[39:20.240 --> 39:24.320]  short clip with the white house medical advisor admitting the masks don't work i don't want to
[39:24.320 --> 39:30.480]  play back to back with that a clip of bill gates giving a little prelude of what he's planning
[39:30.480 --> 39:38.240]  next year in 2023 i actually think uh this is probably the most important long-term thing we
[39:38.240 --> 39:44.880]  can be doing for schools for office buildings for nursing homes indoor air quality is sort of
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.720]  has just not gotten the level of attention it deserves you know most experts believe that if
[39:48.720 --> 39:53.680]  we make some basic investments in indoor air quality we can reduce in fact all respiratory
[39:53.680 --> 39:59.520]  infections by 30 60 even 80 percent i mean the notion that you could cut respiratory infections
[39:59.520 --> 40:04.560]  there's no study in the world that shows that masks work that well so you're never going to get the
[40:04.560 --> 40:10.000]  kind of benefit from mandatory year-round masking as you would from making substantial
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.760]  gruesome indoor air quality plus a lot easier to i just published my yearhead 2023 letter
[40:15.760 --> 40:21.840]  looking at what's going to happen in the next 12 months and beyond life is changing i'm about to
[40:21.840 --> 40:27.440]  become a grandfather i reflect on the challenges we have right now with climate change getting
[40:27.440 --> 40:34.880]  worse the ukraine war tough economic cycle but it's hopefully uplifting because i also share
[40:34.880 --> 40:44.560]  great innovations a great example is gene therapy could cure hiv a ai powered ultrasound machine
[40:44.560 --> 40:51.040]  that will help save lives of moms and newborns climate technologies that will make it so the
[40:51.040 --> 40:59.040]  emissions from buildings go down quite dramatically i'm excited that we can get back making progress

[41:13.760 --> 41:21.200]  created cuba 19 and ran the whole lockdown operation with the communist chinese and the whole world

[42:03.200 --> 42:08.800]  basically worldwide and why is it so important because when bill gates or the w e f say they
[42:08.800 --> 42:14.640]  want something it's done and its standardized policy worldwide we're already deep into world
[42:14.640 --> 42:20.480]  government and the leading edge of it the tip of their spear is the medical tyranny that's why
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.280]  we hammer this and hammer this and hammer this because they already tried to bring new lockdowns
[42:25.280 --> 42:31.120]  back they already tried to bring new um forced injections back and everywhere they're being
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.680]  they're being turned back they're being defeated because the people are waking up but if we go back
[42:35.680 --> 42:41.520]  to sleep they're gonna come right back so we're barely winning right now we've got to continue
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.200]  with the criminal investigations that have now started in germany and the us and everywhere
[42:45.200 --> 42:48.800]  and we've got to bring these criminals to justice in the court of public opinion and the courts
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.280]  themselves and then they do deserve the death penalty for what they've done crimes against

[47:07.520 --> 47:19.680]  me
[47:37.520 --> 47:49.080]  Jim Trills over the country club, perfect allegory of how we live in La La Land Law.
[47:49.080 --> 47:53.600]  The global depopulation extermination operation goes into high gear.
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.680]  All right, I'm going to get back to the global government's announcements of the medical
[47:58.680 --> 48:00.640]  prison that they're building for us.
[48:00.640 --> 48:05.080]  Before I go any further, there are ways to combat this and strike back and fund this
[48:05.080 --> 48:06.080]  operation.
[48:06.080 --> 48:11.520]  The government rolled out two new great lines, InfoWars Platinum and InfoWars MD at InfoWarsTour.com.
[48:11.520 --> 48:16.280]  They are private labels of already bestselling products in the country, take InfoWars Platinum.
[48:16.280 --> 48:22.040]  These are three number one bestsellers already in the country under names that I gave them,
[48:22.040 --> 48:23.040]  private label.
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.600]  1776 testosterone boost is the top natural testosterone booster in the country.
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.240]  Everybody should be taking it, but because of all the garbage they put in the food and
[48:31.240 --> 48:34.400]  the environment, the lower our natural levels of testosterone.
[48:34.400 --> 48:43.920]  Then HGH max boost, oh my gosh, promotes natural hormone stimulation, supports sleep and feeling
[48:43.920 --> 48:52.240]  of well-being, promotes a healthy sexual experience, supports lean muscle mass and definition.
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.240]  And I've already lost 15 pounds just taking it last month and I've not done any exercise.
[48:57.240 --> 49:01.240]  But again, I would only take this when you go to bed at night because it does cause really
[49:01.240 --> 49:02.240]  deep sleep.
[49:02.240 --> 49:07.560]  There's Pain MD that's already number one bestselling natural pain management system
[49:07.560 --> 49:09.280]  in stores under another name.
[49:09.280 --> 49:11.800]  We've probably labeled it under Pain MD.
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.200]  Those are the InfoWars Platinum products, 40% off introductory offer at InfoWarsTour.com.
[49:17.200 --> 49:25.720]  And then briefly, everybody with what's going on in the environment and what's happening

[49:29.560 --> 49:31.520]  essential and we make it easy.

[49:47.080 --> 49:50.000]  We basically only make $4 or $5 on that.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.080]  But that's okay because I want everybody to protect their immune systems and see how great

[51:02.920 --> 51:06.640]  We've made a lot of big changes here to bring everybody a better experience supporting the
[51:06.640 --> 51:07.640]  broadcast.
[51:07.640 --> 51:16.960]  So InfoWarsTour.com, InfoWarsTour.com, okay, let's get back to what I was breaking down.
[51:16.960 --> 51:20.720]  We have Albert Borla, you have Klaus Schwab, you have Benjamin Yatnjahu saying, you're
[51:20.720 --> 51:22.480]  guinea pigs.
[51:22.480 --> 51:25.720]  We're making you take shots to see what it does to you.
[51:25.720 --> 51:28.840]  We're going to innovate science because we're using you as guinea pigs.
[51:28.840 --> 51:32.320]  It's just next level classical authoritarianism.
[51:32.320 --> 51:36.560]  Well, here's Klaus Schwab saying our education initiative.
[51:36.560 --> 51:39.880]  We have Cisco, we have particularly all the big names.
[51:39.880 --> 51:41.440]  We will revolutionize education.
[51:41.440 --> 51:43.320]  We will retrain the teachers.
[51:43.320 --> 51:49.040]  We will put nuclear equipment in place so that we can indoctrinate, that's brainwash,
[51:49.040 --> 51:52.560]  the children with our ideology at an early age.
[51:52.560 --> 51:54.080]  So they penetrate the governments.
[51:54.080 --> 51:55.840]  They put in the presidents and prime ministers.
[51:55.840 --> 51:56.840]  They put in the governors.
[51:56.840 --> 51:58.680]  They put in the DAs.
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.640]  They fill the Justice Department and the other federal systems around the world and they
[52:03.640 --> 52:12.680]  brag openly how they're in control and what founded the DeBose Group, the Bilderberg Group
[52:12.680 --> 52:17.200]  and documents have come out of Bilderberg that they literally run almost every major
[52:17.200 --> 52:21.160]  corporation in the world and they're setting up world government and their biggest funding
[52:21.160 --> 52:24.440]  mechanism is BlackRock in Vanguard.
[52:24.440 --> 52:28.720]  And they know exactly what they're doing and they create all these horrible, globalist
[52:28.720 --> 52:32.320]  policies I'm going to be covering next hour with the 15-minute cities coming to a town
[52:32.320 --> 52:37.040]  near you and the lockdowns, the climate lockdowns and then they sit back when we criticize them
[52:37.040 --> 52:43.800]  and say we must censor the conspiracy theories that claims we are taking over.
[52:43.800 --> 52:49.760]  You will eat some bugs, you will own nothings, you will like it and they just say it with
[52:49.760 --> 52:53.000]  a straight face with their psychotic eyes.
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.200]  Look at Albert Borla, look at Klaus Schwab, look at Benjamin Netanyahu.
[52:57.200 --> 53:00.160]  They're bond villains.
[53:00.160 --> 53:04.160]  Look at Obama, a bond villain and then they've got their puppets like Biden that do whatever
[53:04.160 --> 53:05.680]  they're told.
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.960]  Here is the Klaus Schwab talking about indoctrinating your children.
[53:09.960 --> 53:18.880]  We put emphasis on what I said before, public-private partnerships which we accompany.
[53:18.880 --> 53:27.920]  So when we define a project like our global educational initiative, I just described it
[53:27.920 --> 53:34.400]  in a second, we have under the leadership of Cisco and many other companies, practically
[53:34.400 --> 53:36.800]  all the big names.
[53:36.800 --> 53:48.600]  We try to revolutionize the educational system of Jordan, Egypt and now Burundi by working
[53:48.600 --> 53:56.720]  together with the local authorities, we work also together with UNESCO, not only to equip
[53:56.720 --> 54:04.320]  the schools but to re-train the teachers, to put the new curricula into place.
[54:04.320 --> 54:11.880]  So we work together with the, we are companies, we do not, such a difference to the Clinton
[54:11.880 --> 54:20.720]  initiative which mainly, and which is a good thing, which ask companies to pledge some
[54:20.720 --> 54:26.200]  money to make a commitment and some to come back and to report.
[54:26.200 --> 54:36.960]  We are with the initiative from the beginning to the end, so there's one other difference.
[54:36.960 --> 54:43.760]  So they indoctrinate the children with the ideology at an early age.
[54:43.760 --> 54:48.320]  Now what are some of the other ideologies, not just that euthanasia is good or forced
[54:48.320 --> 54:53.080]  abortions good or forced injections are good or medical apartheid or worldwide vaccine
[54:53.080 --> 54:57.560]  cards and carbon taxes and universal basic incomes and the end of the family and the
[54:57.560 --> 55:03.080]  end of the single family home and the banning of fireplaces and the banning of beef and
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.440]  you know all what they push and suddenly they say it happens.
[55:07.440 --> 55:12.280]  Governments click their heels and go into motion all over the world, including the U.S.
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.640]  They say Canada and places like that are their models, doing the best job implementing the
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.440]  whole program as they penetrate the governments.
[55:21.440 --> 55:24.480]  And what else does Klaus Schwab push?
[55:24.480 --> 55:31.000]  The whole MI6, Cabistock Institute, transgender agenda, go to their website and they say we
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.200]  need more gay characters in the comic books and the children's shows.
[55:35.200 --> 55:38.000]  We need to teach the children to be gay.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.600]  This will help with the population.
[55:42.600 --> 55:49.760]  Type in W.E.F. calls for more gay characters in movies.
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.000]  And then you go look and they're the ones getting the Disney money and getting all the
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.400]  big Time Warner money and all the BlackRock money to go in and teach these initiatives
[55:59.400 --> 56:01.320]  and sexualize their children.
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.440]  They're involved parroting your children, Klaus Schwab is, more than most parents are.
[56:06.440 --> 56:10.160]  And the private schools are on board because they're getting grants.
[56:10.160 --> 56:20.880]  Y.O.B.T.G.Q. representation should be a priority for businesses and the media, W.E.F. forum.
[56:20.880 --> 56:21.880]  See?
[56:21.880 --> 56:22.880]  Everything.
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.080]  Who funds the racial division?
[56:26.080 --> 56:28.920]  Who funds Black Lives Matter?
[56:28.920 --> 56:34.320]  George Soros, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[56:34.320 --> 56:41.440]  This is an organized program against humanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:41.440 --> 56:45.720]  And again, what we're showing you from these super creepy drag queen story times is not
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.040]  the stuff that we can even show on air.
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.440]  It gets far worse, pulling their breasts out, shaking their asses, artificial penises, simulating
[56:55.440 --> 57:02.000]  men having sex with each other, and it's all Klaus Schwab, a creepy psychotic whose grandfather
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.440]  was one of the top Nazis producing weapons for Hitler, including flamethrowers.
[57:08.440 --> 57:12.680]  And boy, they're flamethrowing our children with depopulation agenda we're going to cover
[57:12.680 --> 57:14.080]  when we start the next hour.
[57:14.080 --> 57:21.000]  You want the deep dive on the climate lockdowns, on the 15 minute cities, on what's coming?
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.080]  You are about to get it, and then I'm going to take your calls.
[57:24.080 --> 57:26.160]  We're opening the phones up in the second hour.
[57:26.160 --> 57:31.800]  The phones are now open at 877-789-2539.
[57:31.800 --> 57:36.440]  Ston callers on the subject of the Great Reset, Agenda 2030, the New World Order.
[57:36.440 --> 57:39.600]  There's a hundred topics within that, but I want a discussion of the New World Order
[57:39.600 --> 57:47.320]  agenda and how we stop it at 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex.
[57:47.320 --> 57:57.680]  I want you to remember two words, Info Wars Platinum, in the history of Info Wars supplements,
[57:57.680 --> 57:59.320]  and they're amazing.
[57:59.320 --> 58:05.400]  This is hands down the most powerful game-changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[58:05.400 --> 58:09.920]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a
[58:09.920 --> 58:14.240]  pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements, and the owner's a listener and
[58:14.240 --> 58:15.240]  a supporter.
[58:15.240 --> 58:20.920]  So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what
[58:20.920 --> 58:25.600]  they're sold online under the Info Wars Platinum brand name.
[58:25.600 --> 58:26.600]  These are incredible.
[58:26.600 --> 58:33.120]  Paying MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course 1776, testosterone boost.
[58:33.120 --> 58:37.800]  Read about them at infowarsstore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself,
[58:37.800 --> 58:40.960]  and I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.
[58:40.960 --> 58:45.160]  It will empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air
[58:45.160 --> 58:46.160]  a 360 win.
[58:46.160 --> 58:49.720]  Info Wars Platinum, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[58:49.720 --> 58:54.840]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered, and Info Wars has been the tip of spear against
[58:54.840 --> 58:55.840]  tyranny.
[58:55.840 --> 58:59.040]  It becomes the products we sell to fund our operation.
[58:59.040 --> 59:01.080]  They're just like our news and information.
[59:01.080 --> 59:03.960]  They are powerful, and they change the world.
[59:03.960 --> 59:08.080]  The real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out
[59:08.080 --> 59:09.840]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[59:09.840 --> 59:14.040]  It's finally back at stock for 50% off at infowarsstore.com.
[59:14.040 --> 59:18.320]  Now, the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients therein, but this
[59:18.320 --> 59:20.240]  sucker is amazing.
[59:20.240 --> 59:25.600]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[59:25.600 --> 59:29.920]  Every one of these will supercharge your day and everything you do.
[59:29.920 --> 59:33.320]  Just look into the preglinone that we've got that's in this product.
[59:33.320 --> 59:37.800]  Get your real Red Pill Plus, a proprietary product nobody else has, exclusively back
[59:37.800 --> 59:42.640]  in stock for 50% off at infowarsstore.com.
[59:42.640 --> 59:46.320]  This is as close as the Matrix Red Pill as you're going to get.
[59:46.320 --> 59:49.400]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off, infowarsstore.com.
[59:49.400 --> 01:00:06.000]  All right, coming up next segment, I'm going to drill into the lockdowns, how they're going
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.480]  to roll out the so-called climate lockdowns, but a perfect intro to that is the new document
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480]  piece.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:24.600]  News report put out by Greg Rees, a digital presence being built around you right now.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.000]  Amman Jabi has worked in Silicon Valley for 28 years.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.880]  His background includes work on deep technologies that are involved in the new digital prison
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.240]  system being designed by Big Tech.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.800]  In 2020, he moved to Montana and became a whistleblower, warning the public of the very
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:51.560]  real threat about to be unleashed upon us all, known by many as the Mark of the Beast system.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.080]  Amman explains how accepting the digital ID is the basic premise behind it all.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:04.440]  So by default, a digital identity implies that you are always in a digital prison.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:10.800]  Unless you have a digital identity and you're in a prison, you are by default a criminal.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.520]  So we don't trust you.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:18.400]  Just like the old system, this new one is also voluntary and you are supposed to know
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.480]  that it's a digital prison that you are voluntarily signing up for.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:28.920]  And the reason for this is because in this new system, having a digital ID will be proof
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.760]  that you are a criminal.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.280]  Because having a digital ID means that you are in a digital prison.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.320]  And because you accepted it, you must be a criminal.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.800]  Because of this, there is a new protocol being introduced with this system, known as Zero
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.800]  Trust.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.480]  How is Zero Trust going to be used?
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.120]  Here's a lady she wants to go and buy some beef.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:58.040]  But let's say her carbon footprint or her beef footprint for the month has been exceeded,
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.760]  that door won't open.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.920]  This digital prison is sneaking up on us all.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.160]  There is no need for an implanted chip, because everything is being done with facial recognition,
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.560]  which is already plugged into the entire system.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.280]  America already has more cameras per capita than Communist China, and our social credit
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.400]  score is already being logged.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:27.280]  All we need at this point is a series of events that lead us all into having to make the choice
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.680]  of either accepting the new digital ID or saying no.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.840]  Since the COVID lockdowns, new state-of-the-art LED lights have been replacing street lights
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.240]  in cities throughout the West.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.840]  Amman explains that this is all part of the plan.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:50.000]  These lights will be connected to everything, including your phone and your car.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.080]  And in new cars, that includes 16 different cameras with LiDAR and Sonar.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:03.200]  These lights are being outfitted with LED incapacitators, which is a light technology
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.720]  that was first announced 15 years ago, back when it caused enough brain damage to make
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720]  a person sick.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.880]  Another strange weapon in the final stages of development is able to mount an all-out
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.320]  barrage on the optic nerve.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.360]  The LED incapacitator was developed under the auspices of the Department of Homeland
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.600]  Security for the purposes of creating what we call a non-lethal defense system.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:34.320]  And this technology consists of a bright set of LED technology, light-emitting diodes,
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:41.480]  that is designed to create sort of temporary blindness, meaning temporary ability to not
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.600]  be able to see the person who we're trying to protect.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.640]  If aggressors caught in its bright pulsating glare don't shield their eyes or turn away
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.240]  quick enough.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.240]  Temporary blindness isn't the only effect they'll feel.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:00.320]  The first time I saw the LED I was in a darkened room and within three or four seconds I had
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:05.600]  reached forward and grabbed a hold of a lab bench because I was feeling a little bit dizzy
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.120]  or disoriented.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.960]  The device's combination of different colors and random flashes can induce psychophysical
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.920]  effects, including vertigo and possible nausea.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.880]  It's been nicknamed the puke light.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:24.000]  It's been 15 years and our Silicon Valley whistleblower believes that this technology
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.880]  is now capable of killing people.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.560]  Ultimately, we can say no to this.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:34.040]  But if there's a critical mass that doesn't sign on to the digital ID then this agenda
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.280]  gets weakened substantially.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.360]  But we will have to first unify and come together.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.840]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.720]  I first reported on this 25 years ago and now it's gone on everywhere, it's not a theory.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.720]  Those LED lights actually communicate with sensors on the cars and the smart grid.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.960]  They're being put in inside government buildings worldwide.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.040]  Stay with us ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.640]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]  effects.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.400]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.200]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.640]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.200]  natural male potential.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.280]  These products work great for women as well.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD, it's the number one natural best seller under
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.120]  another name.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.400]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfowarsShore.com under the label Infowars Platinum.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.160]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.400]  Read all about it.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.640]  Be very safe with it.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.560]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.560]  night.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.400]  Don't do it during the day.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.920]  1776 testosterone boost.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920]  Totally incredible.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920]  Go read about them.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:52.920]  Learn more about them at InfowarsStore.com in the Infowars Platinum section and you'll
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:06:10.280]  get 40% off on these already best selling products under the new name Infowars Platinum.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:26.760]  All right, a lot of people have been talking in the last month, it's been officially announced
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.760]  in India, it's been announced in the UK, it's been announced in China, it's been announced
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.760]  in Canada and some cities in the US that hundreds of towns and dozens of major cities around
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:44.280]  cars or even motorcycles or other vehicles get into the city centers and even medium
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.440]  sized towns like Oxford are being broken into a whole bunch of different zones starting
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.440]  this year going operational in about a year from now and I say this year 2023 it was operational
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:04.800]  2024, basically already in 2023 here in two days as you know and so I've been covering
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.800]  pieces of this obviously for 20 plus years, it's in my first film America Destroyed My
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:14.320]  Design from the UN documents but then it was their theoretical plan and their goal under
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:22.760]  agenda 2021 to have this in place and ready to go by 2020 and then have it completely
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:32.480]  in place by 2030 and to describe it is quite a litany but you see the announcements all
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.200]  over the world, they're going to ban most of the farms and ban most of the ranches
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.920]  and the Netherlands is the third biggest food producer in the world and they've got to
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:48.480]  cut the number of cows they have by 2030 by 90% and this year starting next year it's
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:55.680]  30% cut right away, that's why they're protesting, I mean this is not coming, this is here and
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:02.240]  they put out UN maps in the early 1990s when George Herbert Walker Bush signed on and Rio
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:13.360]  de Janeiro to the agenda 21 UN treaty but Congress did not ratify it because the maps starting
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:19.240]  in the year 2000 went through the year 2030 and it then shows the areas that humans aren't
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240]  allowed in.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:25.360]  Now if you're a TV viewer you can see the simulated reserve and corridor system to protect biodiversity
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.820]  is recommended by the UN Conventional Biological Diversity, Wildlands Project, UN and US manned
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:35.200]  biosphere programs and the World Heritage Program as a vital step in attaining sustainable
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:42.040]  development, now that's the map that they wanted by the year 2020 and they've already
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.920]  mapped these out, they've already got them all set up, that's why if you go anywhere
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:51.960]  on that map today physically you will notice they put up long cable barriers so you can't
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.120]  get off the roads, they're shutting down the dirt roads, they're blocking everything off
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.800]  and they're giving grants, federal grants, the state legislatures to close these roads
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:09.280]  and do this so if you put that back on screen over half the country is a human no-go zone
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.320]  and already large parts of national parks, people are being told you're not allowed to
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:21.040]  now go into those areas as well, this is about corralling us into these control zones, now
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:28.200]  when they go forward to the year 2030 the red is even smaller on the maps, the map the
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:35.600]  crew pulled up is the interim map, the final map is almost the entire country in yellow,
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:43.600]  green and blue meaning absolute no-go zones, red is core reserves and corridors, little
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:49.320]  to no human use, buffer zones, highly restricted use and then you've got the other sections
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:56.680]  military bases, Indian reservations and others, but again as you expand that in the year 2030
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:02.600]  almost the whole map is red, that is an interim map with around half the country off limits
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.200]  to any humans and then you've got all the surveillance and the control that goes with
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:13.160]  that and a model of this is a famous city slash state park, it's two different parks
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:18.320]  right across the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco that was just the most incredible
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.400]  I think it's like 15,000 acre city park than where was the state park and if you look at
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.000]  it now they've closed it the last 15 years and no one's allowed into it but government
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.360]  bureaucrats who actually took over the hundreds of homes and cabins within it and the government
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:43.280]  uses it for itself and its guests, so imagine the Hunger Games where you've got the different
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.680]  sections of the country and only certain areas are allowed to be industrialized, all the
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:54.000]  rest are not industrialized, this is really the reverse of that, you're just not allowed
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.940]  in the rural areas under this new map and before Obama left office he signed an executive
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:04.520]  order putting millions of dollars in to this program to accelerate the shutdowns of rural
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.440]  areas, the shutting down of roads, the blocking of highway exits to small towns, all of this
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:16.120]  is about keeping us off the land and killing small towns and stopping the exodus out of
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.720]  the big cities into the small towns getting back to a self-sufficient agrarian future
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.720]  which is the only future you'll have if you don't want to be under the total control grid
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.320]  in just the medium time, in their end game they're going to force everybody off the rural
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:36.240]  areas at gunpoint, so let's look around the world at different cases of the implementation
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:41.560]  of this and go through these hundred articles, when I say hundred articles, it's a hundred
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:49.200]  articles and more of clips, each one of them more insane than the last as this is all admitted.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:57.640]  So here's one, Coke 15 Montreal, 30x30 will create more militarized protected areas around
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.360]  the world, not just in Asia or Latin America or Africa but including in the western world
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:10.400]  with paramilitaries protecting the rural corridors where no humans are allowed to be.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.080]  Here's the future of nature and business world economic forum report, if you want to read
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:24.400]  all about this, continued, harmful instruments, false solutions and private interests take
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.280]  over global biodiversity, summit, even the liberals are pointing out this is a dangerous
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:38.840]  tyranny over at commondreams.org, well you see leftist they always ran it, continuing,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.560]  the homeschoolers attacks are taking place, we'll get into some of that, also the home
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:53.320]  ownership society was a mistake, the Atlantic, here's another one out of Forbes, the Atlantic
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:13:00.440]  is right, home ownership society was a mistake, they want you absolutely in a coffin apartment
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:06.760]  totally controlled, totally surveilled with no family so you're isolated under their control,
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:14.440]  bah humbug, how insects can become the backbone of your Christmas dinner, sky news, this is
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:22.840]  just the latest stuff on this front and it continues on from there, Canada's death cult
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:29.000]  grows as its government promotes assisted suicide, an activity book for little kids,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  we have that activity book we'll show you in a moment, teaching children as young as
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:42.200]  six how great it is to commit suicide to save the earth, again anything to break down society,
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.520]  anything to create the population, anything to hurt us in the compact cities for easier
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:53.320]  control that are really prisons, a veteran wanted a wheelchair lift installed, Canada
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:59.920]  offered her assisted suicide instead, showing you who these folks are, Canada is going to
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:05.800]  allow assisted suicide for healthy people with mental illnesses beginning in 2023, Canadian
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:13.240]  retailer made a viral ad promoting assisted suicide, so Canadian church hosted an assisted
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:20.160]  suicide ceremony for a member getting ready to kill herself, talk about a death cult, here's
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:27.480]  the medical assisted in dying activity book for children, yep, go read it for yourself,
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.680]  we can spend a whole hour just on this chilling report, they have the kids go through the
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:39.840]  different scenarios of what they would of when and how they would kill themselves, think
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:48.400]  of the diabolical over the top nature of that for a moment, and it goes on and on and on,
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.000]  think through the process of killing yourself, they started death education in the US in
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.880]  2000, suicide amongst the young exploded obviously, whether the military is killing themselves
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:04.080]  they're put all through the same workbooks on how good it is to kill yourself, and finally
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.960]  at the end you write an essay on how it would help people to help kill them and help kill
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:17.960]  yourself, this is a death cult, these people mean business, Shawna Schwann, most couples
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.760]  may have to use assisted reproduction by 2045, because for some reason the chemicals in the
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.240]  food and water are sterilizing not just us, but the plants and animals, that's the London
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:37.360]  Guardian, I'm trying to hurry here folks, I haven't even gotten into the 2031 agenda,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.520]  I haven't gotten into the 15 minute cities, I just got through half of one stack, we just
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.160]  got to cover all this and tie it all together, which we'll do on the other side, but this
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.800]  is their horrible plan, this is their nightmare vision, and anybody part of this is joining
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.120]  a satanic death cult, how can you not look at this agenda and call it anything else?
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.840]  There's a war against our masculinity, there's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.680]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:18.360]  us to be, but through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.320]  the globalists have done, and I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've

[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:25.320]  we're back live, thank you so much for joining us, we're laying out the globalist blueprint
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:34.920]  for a prison planet that's being established to carry out the forced population of at least
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:40.040]  90% of the earth and to do that they're not just grooming children to spy on their parents
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:45.840]  but the spear for this with workbooks on how to commit suicide, how great suicide is and
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:51.280]  how to prepare to commit suicide, so when Claude Schwab last hour we played it said
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:57.760]  that they're taking over the schools and indoctrinating the children, he means business, so I suggest
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:03.560]  you go read the medical assistance in dying made activity book being taught to Canadian
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:09.440]  elementary students and middle school students, you want to be blown away here it is and then
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:15.800]  continuing, this is a meme put out by gays against groomers, the people who warned of
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.840]  the slippery slope were right and will never forgive the radical mob that proved them to
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:27.400]  be so, it's our job to reverse it and we will, they put out this graphic that shows a man
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:35.240]  having a gun held to his head and the gun, the arm or rainbow colored montage and it
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:41.480]  says what slippery slope, it will never happen, 1995, love is love, we just want acceptance,
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:49.400]  2005, we want equality, 2012, bake the effing cake, bigot, 2016, say my pronouns are go
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:56.520]  to jail, what's happening, 2022, let kids watch drag shows and mutilate their bodies,
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.120]  now we've gotten into some of the social control teaching you to hate yourself and hate life
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:08.080]  and commit suicide for the earth, now let's get in to the actual control grid and to do
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.720]  that we can play a clip from 1997 my film, American destroyed by design, you can still
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.760]  find free online and it may end up video, I hope you share it, people watch it they're
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:24.160]  blown away, but let's play a clip from 2007, in game blueprint for global enslavement directly
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.360]  from their own UN documents, here's from the intro to the film, two and a half hours
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.120]  long we then go into the specific documents and how they would roll out the lock downs
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.840]  and ban the combustion engine and put you into 200 square foot coffin apartments, back
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.440]  then none of this was being done, now it's everywhere, including Austin, Texas, half
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.840]  the new high rises they're building by city ordinance have to have 250 square foot coffin
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:53.240]  apartments, it's all being done, it's all a global plan, it's all here, it's a nightmare
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.200]  and the deeper you get into it the harder it is to get out, but the basis of it the
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:04.440]  platform the foundation, the face sucking system is the smart phone and the face scan
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:11.960]  and the hand scan for the digital prison to track and control everything you do, so here's
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:21.120]  a clip from in game blueprint for global enslavement 2007, in the near future earth is dominated
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:28.880]  by a powerful world government, once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite,
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:36.760]  the dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind, countries are a thing of the past, every form
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:44.960]  of independence is under attack with the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction,
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:51.640]  close to 80% of the earth's population has been eliminated, the remnants of a once free
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:59.080]  humanity are forced to live within highly controlled compact prison like cities, travel
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:05.200]  is highly restricted, super highways connect the mega cities and keep the population from
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:13.200]  entering into unauthorized zones, no human activities private, AI supercomputers chronicle
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:20.320]  and categorize every action, a prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:27.360]  whose power can never be challenged, this is the vision of the global elite, their goal,
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:34.200]  a program of total dehumanization where the science of tyranny is lost, a worldwide control
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:41.000]  grid designed to ensure the overlords monopoly of power forever, our species will be condemned
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.360]  to this nightmare future unless the masses are awakened to the new world order master
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:54.320]  plan and mobilized to defeat it, erected by a secretive group, the Georgia guide stones
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.520]  are a testament to the elite's plan for a world religion, global laws with a global
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:08.160]  court and army to enforce it, and set in stone, it is written that the population never
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:25.600]  rise above 500 million, end game blueprint for global enslavement, they want you dead,
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.920]  now you're not hearing about the end game, you're living in the first stages of the operations,
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:37.480]  so now let's move through these and I had like 10 clips yesterday for five today, there's
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.480]  no way to play them all, but now thankfully it's happening, so you can go look at these
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:46.200]  cities, they're setting up the first part of the prison grid, the old Robert Mueller
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:51.520]  airport by downtown Austin, that's run by Google, they're setting them up in towns all
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.800]  over the US, all over Europe, all over the world, it's all the same system, 5G everywhere,
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:05.560]  total surveillance, just absolute hell, biometric scanning to buy and sell, and everybody else
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.080]  isn't allowed in and you're not allowed out, you get so many passes to leave and so many
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:14.840]  passes to come in, and of course they can restrict the passes as time goes on, oh you
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:23.960]  get to leave your 15 minute city 100 times a year in Oxford, but after that you get penalized

[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.040]  a war against our masculinity, there's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.840]  air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:18.440]  us to be, but through mother nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.520]  what the globalists have done, and I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.680]  we've got a real game changer now, we've never put anything out that's powerful, it's

[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:05.200]  why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing info wars, attacking myself and
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:10.000]  the crew and our other hosts, because they know we're pro human, they know we're telling
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.840]  the truth, they know we've got their number, they know everything we do is about empowering
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.160]  humanity, and God gave us through mother nature incredible compounds that will supercharge
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:27.240]  our body, stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems, and we came out many years ago with

[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.680]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.760]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones,
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:37.520]  I mean I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:43.440]  Tim Cass IRL, listen what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band dot video for
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:48.200]  granted, because you don't know what you have until it's gone, we need to support free speech
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:53.680]  systems right now, so go check out the store, go support their store, go support info wars,
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:33:00.560]  leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're gone.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:30.400]  Thank you so much for watching, I'll see you in the next video, peace out.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:37.480]  What we're witnessing is a new type of warfare, it's using the supply chain and the surveillance
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:43.800]  systems to control and dominate and brainwash and slowly poison and kill the public.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.080]  Now I could get in the mindset of the globalists who've taken over the world, who are filthy
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:51.320]  rich, they see a lot of lazy people watching netflix going to football games and they say
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:56.320]  why are these fat slobs needed, well it's the large population that built this technology
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.320]  and you don't have a right to come in and play God, and you guys have the worst track
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:06.720]  record of starting wars and just engaging in evil, and so you don't have a right to
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:12.520]  do this, they're not trying to empower humanity, they're trying to grease the skids of our
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:18.600]  collapse, and I know our audience understands that, but we have to get in the mind of the
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.720]  enemy and understand they are going for broke, ladies and gentlemen, and if I made a film
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:31.080]  in 1997 about this, if I made a film in 2007 about this, if I made films in 2011 about
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:37.360]  this, in 2012 about this, and you see it all happening now, can you imagine my frustration
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360]  in reading their documents and seeing them beta tested and know this is all going to
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:48.040]  happen, and now I'm just sitting here inside the operational phase of this and they're
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:52.080]  turning on the 5G, they're giving people poisoned shots, they're putting nano tech in
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:35:01.000]  the food, last year the FDA just said we're not going to regulate nano tech in food, and
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:08.480]  they just start spraying nano tech in all the food, it's madness and you see the neurological
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:15.200]  disorders and the cancer and the infertility off the chain, so our case is proven, we've
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:24.240]  been vindicated, but it's not vindicating if we don't stop it, so Chris Sky says I woke
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.200]  him up when he was 13 years old, he's a well-known activist in Canada, and I think in two minutes
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.600]  he has the best boil down of these 15 minute cities, and again that's just the roll out
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.520]  name of the climate lock down cities, Klaus Schwab admits, so I'm going to get to that
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:43.280]  clip of him in a moment, but first, ladies and gentlemen, the cavalry is here, this is
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.240]  a win-win situation, and I need you just to make the decision to support the broadcast
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.720]  and support your own health, we have so many great products that have been sold out for
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.040]  a long time that are back in stock, like the real red pill plus, and let me tell you what's
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.600]  in the real red pill plus, it's got preglonone that is the basis of all hormones in your
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.880]  body that your body naturally produces, but the phthalates and the chemicals in the food
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.440]  and water block the production of preglonone, there's a lot of missing links here, ionines
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.160]  one of them, vitamin Ds one of them, but even if you're getting all that, if your body can't
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.480]  produce preglonone, you can't produce the regular hormones you've got and accelerates
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:22.800]  aging, so as close as you're going to get to the fountain of youth is real red pill
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.360]  plus, a bunch of trace elements that your body needs to upload the other vitamins and
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.960]  minerals it needs, the vitamins, the minerals, the preglonone, and then an energy blend of
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:39.600]  green tea extract, green tea extract, coffee fruit, yerba mate extract, piranha seed, and
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.000]  more, it would take me a long time to read all the ingredients, but it really is a kitchen
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.960]  sink approach, a proprietary system developed, it is amazing, it's available at infowarstore.com
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.520]  for 50% off, and it's funding our operation, it's a win-win, if you are a fan of it, it's
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.560]  back in stock, if you've never tried it, you should order it today at infowarstore.com and
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.360]  experience the real red pill for yourself today, all right, your calls are coming up
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.920]  next segment, right through the whole next hour, but right now, let's go ahead and get
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:20.640]  back to the control grids, it's not just face scanners and hand scanners and internet
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.440]  IDs to get on the web and social credit scores via the vaccine passport being rolled out
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.960]  everywhere, it's not just QR codes for your menus, all of this is admitted training, it
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:40.280]  is lockdown cities with no cars allowed, where you get taxed to go in and go out, and within
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.960]  those cities, you have absolutely no rights, and it's designed to choke off the rural communities
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:50.760]  and choke off those within the communities to make you absolutely dependent and not self-sufficient,
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:56.800]  that's called domestication, you domesticate animals or slaughter, so stop acting like
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:01.280]  domesticated animals and don't let them build this control grid, here's Chris Skye, Canadian
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.120]  activist laying it out.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.680]  The gray reset is moving along so quickly, the world economic forum is now advertising
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:17.000]  their brand new initiative, 15 minute cities, oh what does that mean, that means everything
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.160]  you're going to need to live, work, survive is going to be within a 15 minute walk of
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:27.000]  where you live, because you're not going to be able to have a car, you're not going to
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.680]  have the time or money to go further away from your home, and they want you to be confined
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:39.440]  to that 15 minute area from where you live for virtually your entire life.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.040]  I'm going to send you a video about how wonderful this is, and I'll send it to the website that
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.840]  explains you, they actually have like 7 different websites set up to explain all the different
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:54.800]  aspects of this and how amazing it's going to be for you, this is literally, literally
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.960]  that you will own nothing and be happy gray reset, where you literally live in a little
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:07.360]  building and you don't get to leave your building for 99% of your life, and you're going to
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:13.760]  stay on that same block for 99% of your life, and once they get you like that, international
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.240]  travel, all the things that you used to enjoy, those are going to be a pipe dream, the little
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.920]  peasants like you, you're not going to be able to enjoy that kind of stuff, you're going
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.320]  to be living in your 15 minute city, you're going to be making no money, you're going
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:31.800]  to be riding the bicycle that you're renting from the government, and your life is going
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.840]  to suck so bad, you're probably going to wish you were dead, and you're not going to
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.080]  be able to say anything about it because if you talk shit, then they'll just take away
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.080]  the little that you already do have, just like they're doing in China, and you'll be
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:50.400]  so 15 minute cities, this is what I've been warning you guys about for years and years
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.800]  and years, and here it is, with all the wonderful propaganda to tell you how amazing it's going
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.600]  to make your lives.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:01.520]  There you go, now I have literally dozens of clubs, but I want to get to your calls,
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.320]  but here's one, here's clip 15 from the World Economic Forum, those little two minute videos
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.360]  they put out in minute videos where you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you will
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.280]  eat the bugs, you will drink the sewage, here they are bragging, oh look, Dutch cities are
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.800]  banning petrol and diesel delivery into the cities, you're not allowed to have any gas
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:23.960]  stations or gasoline or diesel cars, they're only one step ahead of California, this is
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:29.280]  coming everywhere until we admit it's happening, you know, in the Obama deception, I show documents
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.720]  where they were going to start taxing beef and then ban beef, people thought that's crazy
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.960]  that'll never happen, it's their documents, and now it's happening, they're doing it at
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:45.520]  every level, I know the audience knows this, but I'm going to explain this, it's like
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:50.880]  a prelude, it's like you go in to the symphony, you hear their warming up on their instruments
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.360]  and you hear that, you know, great sound and then the symphony starts, it's boom, the symphony
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:03.520]  has started, the symphony of destruction is on like Donkey Kong, go ahead and go to clip
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.000]  15.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.160]  Dutch cities are banning petrol and diesel delivery, the tackle air pollution and climate
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:23.600]  change, 2025 all deliveries must be made in electric vehicles, 14 cities across the Netherlands,
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.480]  it will prevent CO2 emissions equivalent to 216,000 cars off the road, the businesses
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:34.520]  will get help to make the switch, oh money, with grants of up to 5,000 euros towards electric
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.680]  van or lorry, the cities implementing the zero emission zones including Amsterdam and
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:46.640]  Tubic, other areas around the world are also banning exhaust fumes, US Santa Monica has
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.000]  set up a voluntary zero emission delivery zone, UK's first zero emission street is open
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.920]  in central London, each street will be closed to polluting vehicles for 18 months, a scheme
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.920]  to expand into London's financial district in 2022, what's your city doing to encourage
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.680]  cleaner climate?
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:13.560]  All about surveillance, all about control, the global mobility coalition, that's what's
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:25.800]  going on, Hollars, Kevin and Jordan and Perine and Travis and Brian and Wes and Mark and
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:32.160]  everybody else, your phone calls are coming up, but I need to finish up on this show,
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:37.800]  I'm going to race through more of this when we come back and tell you what cities in the
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:42.440]  US are about to switch to this, because again the UN flies them off to the Debo script,
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.280]  flies them off, gives them business deals, buys them off and you're sitting there with
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:52.240]  the UN government like we have here in Austin not even knowing it, just like the UN runs
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:59.200]  the border patrol now, go to the Texas border, the UN is in charge there.

[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:15.240]  system with a supplement that contains both, this Info Wars life offering vitamin C plus
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.360]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the Info Wars store, the rose hips contained
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.760]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:31.600]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.320]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.040]  shown, as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.160]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.280]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.320]  like here in America, so next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfoWarStore.com
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:59.640]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:04.880]  It's a post COVID world now, Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880]  system.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.880]  There's a solution, the wellness company, I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief

[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:36.560]  products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19 acute
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.840]  and post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes and the array of things that now America has
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:47.440]  to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:54.200]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee,

[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:04.000]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered and Info Wars has been the tip of spear against
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  tyranny.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.840]  And when it comes to the products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:13.240]  news and information, they are powerful and they change the world.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.360]  The real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years it's been sold out
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.120]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:23.360]  It's finally back at stock for 50% off at InfoWarsore.com.

[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:09.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:19.920]  All right, I already spent most of the hour on the Great Reset, it's just 2030 and beyond.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.080]  I want to just sum up where it's all going, hit a few other articles and then go to your
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.080]  calls.
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:27.000]  There's no way to get all these clips to cover all this.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.880]  People are going to experience the New World Order for yourselves, you already see it.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.200]  But compliance is death, resistance is victory, resistance is life.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.400]  Now, whether you're in Australia or the United States, it doesn't matter where you are now,
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.440]  if the globalists control your country, it's exact same policies.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:49.360]  And they cut the resources off, they collapse the society, they ship the jobs overseas and
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:54.120]  then they herd you into compact cities and make you go on universal basic incomes where
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:58.880]  you then have to go for weekly psychology meetings with your local political minder.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.360]  And if you make the political decisions they want up front and the cultural decisions to
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.280]  get sterilized or not have a child, at first you'll get credits.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:11.520]  But as more people go along with it, once they clamp down, you're going to get less
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.480]  and less for complying, it's a trap.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.560]  And so, once you get to that point, there's not much hope for those that have complied.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.160]  There's a lot of hope for those that have gone and formed communities near the Amish
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.120]  or the Mennonites or others and gotten self-sufficient and have a community that will support each
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:30.000]  other that won't back down.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.200]  You'll have a better shot, obviously, than people inside the Plandopolis.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.520]  In fact, let's play a clip from one of the Plandopolis programs funded by the Rockefeller
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:45.200]  Foundation in the UN, 12 years ago, four school children in the UK telling them what
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.160]  the future would look like in 2025, 2030.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:53.640]  And it's exactly what you now see happening because it's an exact plan.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.640]  It's authoritarian.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:55.640]  It's horrible.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:58.040]  It should be easy to beat it because it's so illegal.
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:59.040]  It's so criminal.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.040]  It's so painful.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  It's so hurtful.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.040]  It's so dehumanizing.
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.960]  It's so murderous.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.480]  But you've got to admit it's happening.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:12.040]  You've got to admit it's going on before it gets too intense, which it's coming up on.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:17.480]  And anybody serving the system thinking, well, I'll get ahead by complying, you're fools.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.440]  This will screw almost everyone.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.520]  This is so bad.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.880]  It makes my head spin.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:31.080]  So just like you see in Canada, oh, you want a new wheelchair.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.600]  Just commit suicide.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:37.280]  And they pressure you to agree, well, in one year, when your funding runs out, just agree
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.280]  to kill yourself.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.280]  And it's in the news.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:41.120]  They're pressuring people to kill themselves.
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:42.640]  That's the social credit score.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.640]  Kill yourself.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.960]  And as they cut the resources off to everybody else, the general public will be like, yeah,
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.960]  kill grandma.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.320]  Kill that middle-yield person.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.760]  Kill that homeless person.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.240]  But the globalists set the climate up, the political, cultural climate, the godless climate
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.680]  to put people in that position so the rest of us would go along with the evil because
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.560]  that's what they want is us to make the bad decision.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:08.080]  They want us to join with evil because they want to cut us off from God because the ultimate
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.520]  currency is our souls.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.640]  God creates prosperity and milk and honey and freedom.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.320]  The satanic system creates the opposite.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:25.080]  So let's play a clip from, and again, there's more than 10 of these cartoons.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:31.280]  They're all nightmarish, a planned opolis shown more than a decade ago to schoolchildren
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.280]  in the UK.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.200]  This is shown to fifth graders.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:40.480]  Here it is.
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.480]  Forum for the future.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:48.120]  Travel people, travel in the cities of the future, megacities on the move, your guide
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:53.080]  to the future of sustainable urban development.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.360]  Land opolis, one of four possible scenarios.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:00.560]  In a world of fossil fuels and expensive energy, the only solution is tightly planned and controlled
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:11.000]  by urban transport, smart cars, global climate change, deal imminent, joint venture, megacities,
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.320]  everything approved, global food council set up by the UN, welcome to the planned opolis,
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.840]  the day of the life of V.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:27.960]  Hi, I'm so glad you're on time.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.960]  I'm V.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:31.840]  I'm looking forward to showing you around planned opolis today.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.480]  By the way, hit pause.
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.800]  Most people aren't allowed out of their house.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.560]  You've got to get an AI agreement, even leave your home.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.640]  Everything's done with virtual.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.640]  The whole VR world.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.640]  Continue.
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:53.040]  Hi, I'm so glad you're on time.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:58.240]  I'm V. I'm looking forward to showing you around planned opolis today.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.400]  My husband works from home.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.520]  He's a virtual engineer working on one of the city's desalination plants.
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.520]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.480]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.480]  Are you ready to go?
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:16.480]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:21.160]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp the other day, so they've allotted you a journey
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.720]  time to match mine.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.720]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.400]  Watch your brain and go to work.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.440]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega computer in charge.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.440]  We're so lucky.
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:38.120]  Our kids were allocated a school quite near my practice, so I can drop them off from the
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.120]  way.
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.120]  It saves on our calorie ration.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:43.440]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings get their career announcements.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.880]  They've been working so hard, so I'm sure they'll get some food.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.800]  Hit pause again.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.120]  The government tells you what you're going to be.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:56.120]  You have a calorie allotment on your carbon tax, all officially announced now.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:58.120]  All officially announced.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.120]  Continue.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.120]  Though I'm sure they'll get something good.
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:06.120]  Not that there's any role in fixing carbon scrubbers for a living or anything.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.120]  Are you hungry?
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.120]  Let's pop to the market.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.720]  Hit pause again.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.720]  Carbon scrubbers.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.720]  All carbon is bad.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:13.720]  We're made out of carbon.
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.720]  See the sick joke?
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  Continue.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:16.720]  Everything.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:17.720]  Every word is weaponized.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.720]  Hate.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:19.720]  Kill yourself.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:20.720]  Murder yourself.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:21.720]  You suck.
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:22.720]  Just everything is hate.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.720]  Hate.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.720]  Hate.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.720]  Continue.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.720]  On the menu this month?
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.720]  No.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.720]  Not me.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.720]  It's not your birthday.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.720]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:39.720]  I mean, you don't get the choice you used to, but we're better off the most.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:43.720]  I think it's probably easiest to walk from here.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:47.720]  You barely see a car in the city centre nowadays unless you're rich.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:51.720]  The state knows they just aren't practical anymore.
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:52.720]  Hit pause again.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.720]  All the elites will still have their cars, still have their private jets.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:58.720]  You'll just be locked up in the city while they're partying in the countryside.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:53:59.720]  That's the official plan.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.720]  You saw it during the lockdowns.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.720]  Let's continue.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.720]  So much better for getting around our neighbourhood.
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.720]  And why waste valuable space on car parks when you can use them to grow food?
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.720]  I don't care what you say, Alex.
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:14.720]  They don't deserve to live in that ghetto.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.720]  They are completely disconnected.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.720]  No high-speed transport system.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.720]  No new internet.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.720]  They miss out on jobs and many essential services too.
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.720]  Oh, hi again.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:26.720]  Hit pause again.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.720]  What a day.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.720]  And they even make it dystopic because they're showing this to children to normalise the
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.720]  synapses in their brain when they actually live under this.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:36.720]  You see, some of their family lives in a ghetto because they won't take the chip.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.720]  They won't take the control.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.720]  They live in a ghetto.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.720]  They're locked in the ghetto.
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.720]  Let's continue.
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:43.720]  What a day.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:47.720]  I had to make an emergency visit to the Cry Freedom Ghettoes.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:53.720]  I mean, I miss my sister like mad, but I'm glad they went when they moved to New Amsterdam.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.720]  They're safe from climate change on the floating city.
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.720]  That must be her now.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:02.720]  It's much easier to meet up with friends virtually now.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.720]  So many cities have banned cars in central areas.
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:06.720]  Hit pause again.
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:13.720]  See how they trained you 12 years ago, the children, you only talk virtually.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:19.720]  And again, the city centers banned cars years ago, now happening 15-minute cities.
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.720]  12 years ago, telling you the exact plan.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.720]  But adults weren't showing this on the news.
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:26.720]  Children were shown this.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.720]  Just like children are talking about the pedophilia and our TV affiliates, and I understand
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:35.720]  why, have threatened to dump us before when I show the actual drag queen story times with
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.720]  men's erections out, with glitter on their penises, with little kids on their laps.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.720]  Station owners call and say, hey, we like you, show it again, you're off.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.720]  I go, I understand.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.720]  But you know they're showing children, elementary students, men with their penises out.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.720]  And they go, we understand, Mr. Jones, don't show it again.
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.720]  And I agree with that.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:56.720]  But see, show the children the brainwashing, but the adults can't see it because we're
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.720]  not supposed to know what's going on.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.720]  Let's continue.
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:08.720]  Find out more about how we may live and travel in the cities of the future.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  And it's sponsored by the UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:16.720]  Can't make this up.
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.720]  All right, I'm going to go to your calls now.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.720]  I'm going to go to Kevin first when we come back, and then Jordan, and then Stephanie,
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.720]  and then Corrine, and then Travis, and then Brian, and then Mark and Wes.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.720]  I'm going to go right to your calls when we start the next hour.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.720]  I did an OK job at getting to some of this.
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.720]  I got to half the stack.
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:40.720]  But maybe later after I take calls, I'll hit the rest of it.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.720]  But this is just diabolical.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:46.720]  And that's why I'm so frustrated is this is not my opinion.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.720]  And we've had major inroads against the enemy because of your support.
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:54.720]  And we could stop this easily.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.720]  More governors involved, more legislatures, more criminal investigations of the New World Order.
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:00.720]  Criminal investigations across SWAB.
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.720]  Everything they're doing is illegal.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.720]  Again, NGOs under Biden run the border patrol and command them.
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:07.720]  I've been there.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.720]  We've listed the names.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.720]  There's a criminal investigation now.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.720]  We told you two years ago.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:16.720]  The UN runs the open border in Texas and California and Arizona.
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.720]  The UN main NGO.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:21.720]  No, stop.
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.720]  Stop.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:23.720]  This is so simple.
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:24.720]  This is illegal.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.720]  This is crazy.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:26.720]  This is bad.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:27.720]  This is destructive.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.720]  This is horrible.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.720]  Hour number three in your phone calls, bam, bam, bam, are coming up straight ahead.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.720]  And I got tons of other breaking news and stuff, but it's all on Infowars.com.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:42.720]  Please don't forget we've got the new Infowars Platinum line, 1776 testosterone boost, pain
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:48.720]  MD, and ACH max boost.
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:52.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:57.720]  of Infowars under a new brand name, Infowars Platinum.
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:02.720]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:07.720]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:11.720]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:17.720]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.720]  other names.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:24.720]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:26.720]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.720]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.720]  We're talking about pain MD.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.720]  We're talking about HGH max boost.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:38.720]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:40.720]  These things are incredible.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.720]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your healthcare
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.720]  provider because they're so powerful.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.720]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:21.720]  Infowars MD at infowarstore.com.

[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:46.720]  same product on store shelves for up to twice the cost.
[01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:48.720]  Find Infowars MD at infowarstore.
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:55.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:14.720]  There's been some big breaking Jeffrey Epstein news, the biggest yet.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.720]  I'm going to cover it at infowarstore.com at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:24.720]  But right now, I just did over an hour analysis of Agenda 2030 and how to stop it.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:25.720]  Tabitha New York.
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:26.720]  Thank you for holding.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.720]  I really appreciate you calling.
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:32.720]  You know about the New World Order, the Great Reset and Fighting Back against the Unwoke.
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:33.720]  Go ahead.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:34.720]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:40.720]  Thank you for so many years of being in the forefront and to go along with that Great Reset
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.720]  and New World Order.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:42.720]  We know we don't want any of it.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:48.720]  It's amazing how many of the zombie sheep that we have that are allowed to sleep and we can't
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.720]  seem to wake them.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:56.720]  And what's got them asleep is if anyone who drank the demjuice, their minds are just numb.
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:03.720]  The demjuice, well, that's in SNBC, that's CNN, that's mainstream media, that's New York
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:06.720]  Times, that's any left-wing news and information.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.720]  If they drank the demjuice, that's what's making them numb so we don't get a chance to
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:16.720]  get through to them because they've been taught through drinking the demjuice what network
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:18.720]  to stay away from, who not to listen to.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:19.720]  So then they got that.
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.720]  They worked very hard.
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:21.720]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:25.720]  They have closed minds, but that's really a minority of people.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.720]  It's the big majority.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.720]  They're just tuned out and don't even know what's going on is the big problem in my view.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.720]  Yeah.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.720]  And so you're right down the line with that.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:38.720]  If Hillary had have gotten in, we were so lucky that she wasn't because Donald, 45, helped
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:40.720]  to expose a lot that I didn't know.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:42.720]  I didn't know the stuff about Obama because...
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.720]  Well, Trump wasn't perfect, but he helped draw the U.N. and the New World Order out and
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:50.720]  really get their covert operations out in the open.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.720]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:54.720]  So, and that's pretty much what I'm adding there, but we need a plan.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:57.720]  The plan has got to be coordinated.
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:59.720]  What is the plan to get out to wake people up?
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:02.720]  They're going to wait for it to come by them in the butt when they're going to have a gun
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:04.720]  pointed at their face saying, you go this way.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:06.720]  We're trying to stop it before it gets there.
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:07.720]  That's why we've got this show.
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:09.720]  It's why people are making films.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:11.720]  We're trying to warn people.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:14.720]  We're influencing a lot of influencers, but really it's an information war.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.720]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:17.720]  Okay.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:18.720]  Let's go to Mark in Louisiana.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.720]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:23.720]  Well, I'd like someone to honor your request and just say kudos.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:24.720]  Long time listening.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:25.720]  First time caller.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:29.720]  My description really should have been a rail gun.
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:33.720]  I'm going to just run through some things real quick.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.720]  Last couple of weeks, you mentioned the X file show.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:39.720]  One of the things I wanted to call and talk about back then was the fact that A, it was
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.720]  a great representation of info wars and its nasty that you guys show, but also it really
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.720]  dove into how there's a war between the factions of the elite, especially in particularly race
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:52.720]  into the space colonization.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:57.720]  Now that being part of the great reset plan, you also have to consider the fact that immigration
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.720]  is pushing everything up to the border and into our land.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:05.720]  It's spilling over and that's creating a situation where much like X files predictive
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:10.720]  program and leads us to the purge movies where we live in a country that's overburdened,
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:14.720]  can't afford to pay its entitlements, can't afford to support people.
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.720]  Therefore, now you enter the Albert Pike territory of the third world war of releasing the Niles
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:24.720]  and the atheists to basically eradicate most of the civilization until that minority is
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:26.720]  wiped out by the majority.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:29.720]  And the last caller said was to wake them up in their plan.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:31.720]  They wake them up to the Luciferian doctrine.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:35.720]  The last point I wanted to make about the vaccine, there is a way to beat it.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:38.720]  People actually beat a lawsuit in Washington state.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.720]  Literally, I couldn't take it because I didn't know the ingredients.
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:47.720]  I lost the job, got fired, went to court and actually proved that I had an allergen to
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.720]  protest this, which is what they call vaccine.
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:54.720]  If you had any allergy to any ingredients in these vaccines, the court will side with you.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.720]  Make sure you get that in doctrine.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.720]  That's right.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:58.720]  All you got to do is declare you have allergies.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.720]  Great point.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:00.720]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.720]  It saved me 10 grand, Alex.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:06.720]  And the last point I want to make, Schwab coming out about indoctrinating the children in the
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:09.720]  video you just played about 12 years ago, that's my generation.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:16.720]  I was growing up in 2006 in college doing English 101 comp papers, proofreading essays on
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:18.720]  building baby from the gene up.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:24.720]  I've still got my textbooks talking about the medical ethics of euthanizing, conjoined twins.
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:25.720]  Exactly.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.720]  Everything we're seeing now has been brainwashed into the students in primary and secondary
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.720]  school the last 20 years.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:35.720]  That's how we know their plan because it's all laid out there and now we're living it.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:36.720]  That's right, guys.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:37.720]  Watch the purge.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.720]  Read that Albert Pike letter.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.720]  Get with your doctors, y'all.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:43.720]  Build this defense up and stay tuned.
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:44.720]  Absolutely, folks.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.720]  You're not going to have a choice.
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.720]  The world's going to get so crazy and so out of control, you will move to protect yourself
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.720]  at a certain point.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:53.720]  And obviously, folks tuned in here are already ahead of the curve.
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:54.720]  That's why I salute you.
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:58.720]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:03.720]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:06.720]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:11.720]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water, and the food, and the
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:16.720]  feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:17.720]  our natural male potential.
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:19.720]  But these products work great for women as well.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:24.720]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:30.720]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWareStore.com under the label InfoWare's Platinum.
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:32.720]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:33.720]  Read all about it.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:35.720]  Be very safe with it.
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:38.720]  I take only a fraction what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:40.720]  Don't do it during the day.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:43.720]  1776 testosterone boost.
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.720]  Totally incredible.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:45.720]  Go read about them.

[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:11.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:17.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:22.720]  Well, the New World Order isn't just some corporate globalist academic plan for a
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:25.720]  technocracy in total control to carry out the forced population.
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.720]  We're now living deeply into the first stages of it.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.720]  We're going to turn on your phone calls and then out of the hour, huge development on the Jeffrey Epstein front.
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:35.720]  So big.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:37.720]  Just going to leave it at that.
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:40.720]  You can find the article at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:43.720]  This is the biggest development yet.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.720]  This is the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:51.720]  This is Jeffrey Epstein, Mossad, CIA, MI6, child trafficking operation.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:54.720]  The biggest news breaking yet in that is now broke.
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:57.720]  It's tied into FTX, everything else that's coming up.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:59.720]  Right now, let's go to Wes in Missouri.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:01.720]  Wes, thanks for holding it on the ear.
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.720]  Yeah, Alex, I've been talking to you for a long time.
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:09.720]  And I just want to know what your thoughts about Dr. Potendik.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:15.720]  Now, he would say Russia, double-crossed China, and then they would join forces.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.720]  Who said that?
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:19.720]  Dr. Potendik.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:21.720]  I was talking about Steve Potendik.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:23.720]  Steve Potendik, yes.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:25.720]  What did he say?
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:35.720]  Didn't he say that the World War III would start with the United States and Russia starting a war, and then Russia would double-cross China?
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:36.720]  Excuse me.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.720]  Well, Potendik says a lot of things.
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:42.720]  I didn't particularly hear that from him, but what's your view on that?
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:52.720]  Well, he said that a long time ago, and the way the New World Order is pushing Russia into a war, like they don't even care about nukes.
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:56.720]  Do they kind of maybe know that they're on the same side? That's why they don't really care?
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.720]  You know, I don't think that's really going on.
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:06.720]  There's definitely back channels on both sides, but Russia's been driven into China's arms now more than ever, and I don't see Russia and China having a conflict.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:10.720]  I know that General Flynn wanted to work with Russia and cut off China.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:14.720]  That was a good idea, but that plan was killed. Anything else?
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.720]  I just wanted to know what your thoughts were on that.
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:24.720]  Well, look, Russia doesn't want to be in this conflict, but the West overthrew the Ukrainian government nine years ago.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:27.720]  They've been attacking Russian assets in the area.
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:32.720]  The West is now bombing inside Russia, so these things are escalating very, very quickly.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:38.720]  I think the fight between the West and Russia is extremely real and extremely dangerous. I appreciate your call.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.720]  Great question. Jordan in Minnesota, you're on the year.
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:46.720]  Yeah, it's a long time listening. I'm a big fan.
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.720]  Listening to your show was like when Roddy Piper puts on the glasses and they live.
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:57.720]  People listening, they get to see the corruption, the veil around them without...
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:00.720]  Did you know we even interviewed Roddy Piper one time?
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:02.720]  Oh, really? Yeah.
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:04.720]  He was a big listener.
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:09.720]  Looks super healthy when he was on the show, died down like a heart attack a year later after he was on.
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:14.720]  Yeah, unfortunately, it seems like the demise of all wrestlers, but...
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:16.720]  Yeah.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:25.720]  So, yeah, I just want to talk about the two types of currency that allows the New World Order to survive and ultimately thrive.
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:30.720]  Keeps people enslaved and ways we can fight back against it.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.720]  First system, obviously, is the fiat system, which has been rigged in their favor.
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:41.720]  You know, all the banks and just the devaluing, all the inflation.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:48.720]  But there are ways we can fight against it by just doing a research on where we spend our money.
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:54.720]  I'll spend it on companies that actually care about people, patriotic...
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:56.720]  Absolutely, where you spend your money is so important.
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:03.720]  If you can, have a job in town, but have a little farm, grow your own food, can your own food, sell your own food.
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:07.720]  Creating those micro-economies is checkmate to the New World Order.
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:12.720]  And people supporting the farmer's markets or going out and directly buying from farmers.
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.720]  You know, I buy produce from farmers, I buy whole raw milk from farmers,
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:18.720]  and that just scares the hell out of the system.
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.720]  And as more of us do that, it's game over for the New World Order.
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:25.720]  Right, and it brings us closer together as a humanity too,
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:30.720]  and we don't have a middle man that we're going through to our neighbors.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.720]  Real wealth is not going to a football game or going to Las Vegas or partying.
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:38.720]  Real wealth is being self-sufficient and not being part of the system.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:40.720]  And the system is going to force everybody to make a choice.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:46.720]  Join with it, give up all your rights, give up control of your body, let them put poisons in you, let them kill you,
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:50.720]  or start building the new future today.
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:56.720]  Right, and then just the second type of currency they have is attention.
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:59.720]  They want us to pay attention so they can keep us in a state of fear
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.720]  and push their satanic agenda by color coding it and just normalizing it.
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:06.720]  You know, that's the great point you make.
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.720]  Our attention is a form of worship.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.720]  Our attention is the ultimate currency, and that's how they still dominate us.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:17.720]  That's why I almost don't like my show, and I want to focus more on the solutions,
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:22.720]  but we also got exposed to bad because we are still giving them attention even though we're exposing them.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.720]  Yeah, we have to see the problem before we can fix it.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:31.720]  That's what you're doing for sure, and hopefully people are out there fixing it.
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:34.720]  You're a smart guy, Jordan.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.720]  So fiat currency, the new digital currency particularly, surveils us, controls us in absolute nightmare,
[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:43.720]  and you're right, the other way is they get our attention.
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:50.720]  Yeah, that's two things that people need to be aware of and ways to play back anyway.
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:55.720]  Can you just say we're Motel 6 and we'll leave the light on for you?
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:01.720]  Yeah, InfoWars is definitely the tip of the spear ever since I woke up for the corruption.
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:05.720]  InfoWars has been there for me and just telling me what's going on,
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:10.720]  and I do my own research on the side too, and everything turns out to be true,
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.720]  even if it's five years down the road.
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:17.720]  Media, I mean, I don't know.
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.720]  By the way, I wasn't making fun of your great accent.
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.720]  You sound like the guy that, remember the old Motel 6 ads?
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.720]  Yeah, that's what people are saying as a deep voice.
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:30.720]  You sound just like the Motel 6 guy.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.720]  Say, welcome to InfoWars and we'll leave the light on for you.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:38.720]  Welcome to InfoWars, we'll leave the light on for you.
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.720]  I love you, Gordon, thank you buddy.
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:44.720]  That's fun.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:47.720]  Let's talk to Travis in New Hampshire, go ahead.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:50.720]  Yes sir, Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.720]  Man, that guy was a dead ringer for the Motel 6 guy.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:56.720]  Yeah, that was funny.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.720]  Hey, I just wanted to real quick just say as far as like,
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:03.720]  obviously the biggest issue like you just mentioned
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:06.720]  is waking up the vast majority of these people that are just,
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.720]  no, not even including anything.
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:13.720]  Two points would just be to like have put together,
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:15.720]  it'd be nice to have sort of like a cheat sheet
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:17.720]  because like these people have done so much heinous stuff,
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.720]  it's hard to remember all the stuff these guys are doing
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.720]  and to be able to try to, you know, state it clearly
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:26.720]  and get the information out to people,
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:28.720]  I think it would help out a lot.
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:29.720]  No, I agree.
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:31.720]  The next book I'm thinking about writing is
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:33.720]  The Globalist War Against Humanity
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:36.720]  and just have it be like a hundred points
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.720]  and like each point's like three pages
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:40.720]  and it's just like, here's how they're attacking you here,
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:41.720]  here's how they're attacking you there
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:42.720]  and here's how to counter it,
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:45.720]  just so people can look around and recognize
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  how they're attacking us
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:48.720]  and they even brag how they're doing it.
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:50.720]  Well, what's crazy is this is all admitted,
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:52.720]  they admittedly want pedophilia,
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:54.720]  they admittedly want forced euthanasia,
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:57.720]  they admittedly want over run-run borders,
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:00.720]  I mean these people are bad.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.720]  Yeah, the other point quickly was to try to put together
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:08.720]  something to start kind of getting the youth aware
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.720]  of the stuff too because I know when I was a kid,
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:14.720]  you know, the things that everything was like,
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:17.720]  you know, mainstream, it really wasn't as popular
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:20.720]  so the more that, you know, you get it out the open
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:22.720]  that what is actually going on
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:24.720]  and they're setting these kids up for it,
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.720]  they'll take care of it on their own
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:30.720]  and wake up just like, you know, like how you did with me
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:32.720]  when I was a kid, so.
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:34.720]  Well, that's the most important thing listeners
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:36.720]  and viewers can do is remember how they got woken up
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:38.720]  and continue to tell people about infowars.com
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:40.720]  or different articles or videos,
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.720]  that's how we override the sensors,
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:44.720]  that's how we override the AI.
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:46.720]  Anything else, Travis?
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:48.720]  No, thank you guys, I love you guys, take care.
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:51.720]  Love you Travis, we really appreciate your call.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.720]  Alright, we got a lot of calls that segment.
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:58.720]  When we come back, Corrine, I think is how you say it,
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.720]  and then Stephanie, and then everybody else
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:03.720]  in the order your calls are received,
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.720]  Brian and others, call free number to join us,
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:09.720]  877-789-2539, the phones are loaded,
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:11.720]  but as soon as you hear a caller hang up,
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.720]  that's your chance to call and I'd love to hear from you,

[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:34.720]  We exposed it long before,
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:37.720]  most of the big thinkers fighting it that are awake now
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:40.720]  admit I woke them up, you woke them up by your support,
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:43.720]  and so we've already done revolutionary, legendary work,
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:45.720]  all praise goes to God,
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.720]  but I know our greatest work is still yet to come
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:50.720]  and that can only happen if you financially support
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.720]  great products at the same time at infowarstore.com,

[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:00.720]  Why does the establishment spend so much time
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:02.720]  demonizing InfoWars,
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:05.720]  attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:07.720]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:09.720]  They know we're telling the truth.
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:11.720]  They know we've got their number.
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:15.720]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:18.720]  They'd know what we do.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:20.840]  that will supercharge our body's stamina,
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:23.360]  libido, energy, and immune systems.
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:27.520]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:30.640]  that has all the documented compounds like preglinone
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:34.840]  and so much more to supercharge your body.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:38.240]  And to give your body the key elements
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:40.760]  and the key ingredients it needs to function
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:42.040]  at a proper level.
[02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:45.000]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.920]  This is Real Red Pill Plus, sold out for two years,

[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:05.400]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:12.400]  I asked Bobby Diller, I asked the Beatles.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:20.520]  Anybody who's asking, why are there so many
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:21.560]  evil people in control?
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:22.600]  It's very simple.
[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:26.440]  When good people don't stand up and an evil get in charge
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:29.320]  for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years,
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.240]  they recruit more and more evil people in
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:32.760]  and then when they retire or die,
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:34.520]  the next group's even worse.
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:37.880]  So you always get the very worst, the worst in control
[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:39.520]  till it just makes absolutely no sense.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:42.720]  Again, why did Jeffrey Dahmer kidnap gay men
[02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:43.720]  and torture him to death?
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:44.720]  Because he liked it.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.600]  Why did John Wayne Gacy do that?
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:52.400]  Why did Charlie Manson want to kill Sharon Tate
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:56.080]  and cut her baby out and hang with that baby around her neck?
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.880]  I mean, you and I don't want to do that.
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:03.880]  But we're not in command because we don't want control.
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:09.280]  These people want control and I've interviewed,
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:11.640]  I forget her name, the famous psychiatrist
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:15.160]  who was, she's still around, who's the best selling author,
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.760]  who's the psychiatrist of serial killers.
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:22.040]  Guys, type in the psychiatrist of serial killers.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:24.160]  And she goes and spends sometimes off and on years
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:25.440]  with these people.
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:26.840]  But she was on the show like 10 years ago,
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:27.720]  we should get her back on.
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:29.000]  I heard her on Coast to Coast once,
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.160]  got her number from George Norian, got her on.
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.280]  And I said to her, you know, I've read some of your books,
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:35.040]  but you don't get a lot into it.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.760]  Aren't most of these people really Satanists?
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:39.800]  And she said, yeah, they believe demons control them
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:43.280]  and they're only happy when they're murdering and killing.
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.760]  So see, there's that entire psychotic nature to this,
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:50.880]  that they only get a thrill out of doing something bad.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:52.760]  Like, you know, a lot of child molesters
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:54.280]  don't want to just have sexual kids.
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:56.160]  They want to hurt them.
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:59.600]  It's a vampiric psychic vampire effect.
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.720]  And those of us that aren't into that,
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:04.080]  because we don't resonate with that,
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:05.160]  just don't think it exists.
[02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:10.160]  Because why would you pull up in a rural area or a town
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:13.040]  and there's a seven year old or five year old
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.560]  or four year old playing on a swing?
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:16.040]  And you say, hey, little kid,
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:19.800]  I've got candy and a puppy here in the van.
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:22.240]  And then you get them in the van, you tie them down,
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:25.400]  you gag them and you take them to a barn
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:28.840]  and you rape and torture them for two weeks and kill them.
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:29.720]  Well, you would never do that.
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:31.960]  I would never, you would never think of that.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:34.520]  But they have a compulsion.
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:37.240]  Klaus Schwab has a compulsion to put poison in your body.
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:39.280]  He has a compulsion to slowly kill you.
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:41.160]  So does Bill Gates.
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:43.520]  Their actions, so their psychotic killers.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:48.160]  But also just the way they act and they look
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:51.160]  makes the skin on your back
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:53.880]  and the hairs on the back of your neck crawl.
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.600]  Because your body is repulsed by them.
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.600]  You'd never have Bill Gates babysit
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:02.480]  your five year old daughter or son.
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:06.240]  You wouldn't let Tony Podesta around your children
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:07.400]  or John Podesta.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:08.800]  You wouldn't let Bill Clinton around,
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:09.800]  but they run your life.
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:12.560]  They run my life and they should not run anymore.
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:15.440]  But we have to know who they are.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.200]  We have to expose who they are.
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:18.920]  And we have to go through the pain
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:24.000]  and roll up our sleeves and fight them.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.760]  And yeah, I've been attacked for fighting them.
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:28.680]  I've gone through some hell.
[02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:33.200]  But my cells, my guts, my spirit loves what I'm doing.
[02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:38.040]  My body, my soul tells me, God tells me, through my cells,
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.840]  through the Holy Spirit that's broadcasting
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:44.320]  through all time and all dimensions
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:46.600]  that you are doing what you're supposed to.
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:50.080]  You are on the path.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:53.520]  So if they like to kill kids, we like to fight them.
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:54.520]  I'm gonna go back to your calls
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:56.240]  and hit this big Jeffrey Epstein news.
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:59.440]  But remember, we can't do what we do here on air
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:02.480]  without you and we make it so easy to support.
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:04.240]  We have a new line of supplements
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.920]  that are all best sellers.
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:08.000]  Some aren't number one best sellers.
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.080]  Some are number one best sellers.
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.160]  From a big national supplement maker
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:14.840]  that it turned out was supplying us
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:16.520]  with more than half of the ingredients
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:19.400]  we were getting from other big supplement manufacturers
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:22.000]  that we thought were the source, but weren't.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:25.520]  So the persecution and the attempts to shut us down
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:28.480]  led us to the actual sources in the last year.
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:30.400]  Now we've got InfoWars MD.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:33.000]  The first 10 products are out.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  Incredible 95% turmeric, turmeric 95, CBD oil in 10,
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:41.560]  25 and 1,000 milligram highest quality

[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.880]  If you haven't tried CBD,
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:48.560]  there's no THC in it, just all the good stuff
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:50.860]  that helps your body.
[02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:53.720]  We have the 25 milligram and 1,000 milligram left.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:57.320]  The 1,000 milligram is a dropper,
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:59.560]  the 25 milligram is gummies.
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:00.760]  It's selling out very quickly.
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:04.440]  The 10 milligram is already sold out at infowarsstore.com.
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:06.800]  We have Mushroom Max that is a number one
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:08.240]  national best seller.
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:11.560]  Mushroom, rare mushroom formula that naturally boosts
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:14.120]  mental acuity, all the top people taking tests
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.320]  and you name it and the top computer programmers
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:17.440]  take this formula.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:19.360]  It's the number one seller in the country.
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:21.480]  It's private labeled by four or five other groups.
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:23.320]  We're private labeling it and selling it
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:27.320]  for upwards of half the cost other people are selling it for.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:30.480]  Mushroom Max, infowarsstore.com.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:33.880]  And then of course there is the other great products
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.880]  like libido RX, all these natural key concentrated compounds
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:41.160]  that just invigorate your life in general,
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:43.920]  not just turbo charging your libido.
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:47.600]  It's available at infowarsstore.com as well.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:51.440]  I hope you get all those great products
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.920]  and Real Red Pill Plus sold out for more than two years,
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:56.040]  50% off.
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:00.840]  Finally, back of stock at infowarsstore.com.
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:02.200]  And I wanna say something.
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:06.360]  We routinely sell stuff at 30, 40, 50% off.
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.720]  We can't do that with infowars, MD
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.360]  because there's not much markup in it.
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:16.760]  A 25% off discount at infowars, MD is like a 40% discount
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:17.600]  on the other products.
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:20.280]  So it's already a great deal.
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.080]  In fact, let me say that then I'll go to your calls
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:23.640]  and back to the big news.
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:25.800]  Take vitamin D3.
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.080]  I told them a month ago, I want people to have this
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.880]  because of the winter and the immune system
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.320]  and I wanna feel good about really getting this out
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:34.840]  to people so everybody takes it,
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:37.440]  especially gives it to older folks and folks with dark skin
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:40.080]  that don't have enough vitamin D3, just look into it.
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.880]  And they came and they said, okay, it's gonna sell out
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:42.840]  in about two weeks.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.360]  They told me this on Tuesday.
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:48.040]  And I said, well, what are you selling it for?
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:50.000]  They said $14.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.160]  And I said, why'd you let me sell it 50% off?
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:58.160]  So it was actually at more than 50% off at $14.95.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.120]  So we've gone to $19.95 because we gotta get $6, $7 here
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.080]  folks to fund the operation.
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:06.840]  So it's back to $19.95, that's still a huge deal.
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.520]  It's gonna sell out soon, but they did talk since
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.120]  to me, you know, the folks in accounting.
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:12.600]  They said, you gotta stop selling stuff
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:14.240]  and only make it five bucks on it.
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:16.840]  You're not gonna get better vitamin D3 anywhere
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.640]  with calcium or anywhere near this price.
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:24.600]  We're gonna keep it at $19.95 until it sells out
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:27.840]  infowarstore.com and vitamin mineral fusion is there
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:30.040]  at 50% off as well.
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.440]  In this environment with the viruses and the stuff going on,
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:34.600]  I think you're insane if you're not taking
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:36.160]  vitamin mineral fusion with all the vitamins,
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:37.600]  all the minerals, amino acids.
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:39.160]  If you're not taking our multivitamin,
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:42.400]  if you're not taking our vitamin C and zinc formula,
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:43.920]  it's the Linus Pauling formula,
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:48.920]  1100% of natural vitamin C from rose hips,
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.880]  that's the source you recommended was the best
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:54.120]  with zinc for better upload, it's 50% off.
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:55.920]  Everybody should be taking this right now,
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:57.880]  especially with the winter and what's going on,
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:01.720]  infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three,
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:02.920]  three, one, three, nine.
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.920]  Now I'm done plugging for the rest of the show
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.160]  and I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna hit
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:10.320]  every Epstein news and I'm gonna then go
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:14.200]  to Corin, Stephanie, Gary, Brian, Tammy,
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:17.400]  Lauren, JD, Chas, Mike and everybody.
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:19.960]  I will get to every single call
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.400]  before we end the broadcast today.
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:27.800]  Maria Z from Australia is taking over from Australia.
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:29.560]  Always has a lot of key intel because they're
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.320]  the testing ground just like Israel is for tyranny.
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:36.120]  I'm gonna take 15 minutes of the hour she's got
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:38.920]  because I've got other news I'm gonna hit next hour as well.
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:40.760]  They haven't gotten to this breaking as we speak
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:43.880]  but I'm coming right back with the big Jeffrey Epstein news
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:45.080]  and your call straight ahead.
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:46.680]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:49.600]  Oh, I almost forgot, InfoWars Platinum
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:51.560]  is now available at InfoWars store.
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:53.520]  You gotta look into InfoWars Platinum,
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:56.200]  1776 testosterone boost and more.
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:00.200]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:02.760]  since high school and they had great effects
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.720]  and the science has gotten better and better
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:06.440]  over the years.
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:09.080]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.160]  and the water and the food and the feminizing factors,
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:14.280]  it is more important than ever to use the compounds
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.240]  God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:19.240]  But these products work great for women as well.
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:21.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Payne MD.
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:24.160]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:27.760]  We got it discounted for 40% off infowarsstore.com
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:30.000]  under the label, InfoWars Platinum.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.120]  We've also got HGH max boost.
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.840]  Read all about it, be very safe with it.
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:36.720]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:38.280]  and take it before you go to bed at night.
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:40.360]  Don't do it during the day.
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:43.880]  1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:45.920]  Go read about them, learn more about them
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:50.880]  at infowarsstore.com in the InfoWars Platinum section

[02:29:57.720 --> 02:30:00.800]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:03.720]  and InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:05.480]  And when it comes to the products we sell
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.360]  to fund our operation, they're just
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:10.320]  like our news and information, they are powerful
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:11.960]  and they change the world.
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:14.120]  The real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers
[02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:16.200]  but for over two years, it's been sold out
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:17.760]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:22.760]  It's finally back in stock for 50% off at infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:24.720]  Now, the limited time we have, I can't get into
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:26.120]  all the ingredients there in it,
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:28.000]  but this sucker is amazing.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.120]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is,
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:33.320]  ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:36.440]  Every one of these will supercharge your day
[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:37.760]  and everything you do.
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:39.920]  Just look into the preglonone that we've got
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:41.240]  that's in this product.
[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:43.800]  Get your real Red Pill Plus, a proprietary product

[02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:53.040]  This is as close as the Matrix Red Pill
[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:54.120]  as you're gonna get.
[02:30:54.120 --> 02:30:57.960]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off, infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:01.160]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:02.560]  in ForWars MD.
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:04.680]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you
[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:06.440]  how incredible these products are,
[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:09.680]  but all of these products are already sold
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:12.200]  on store shelves under other brand names
[02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:15.000]  for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.600]  These are high-end, these are the very best.
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:20.080]  You know our body's Ultimate Turmeric formula is amazing?
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:20.920]  Well, guess what?
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:23.160]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically
[02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:26.240]  the same formula for a lower price.
[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:28.960]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:32.280]  Up to 50% less than major competitors
[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:35.840]  selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:39.520]  And it goes on for all the new infowars MD products
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:41.040]  at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:44.200]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer
[02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.680]  to your door at prices up to 50%,
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:51.040]  in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:58.040]  In ForWars MD at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:00.400]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield,
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:02.920]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:05.320]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:07.200]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:09.760]  And I heard Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:12.360]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield,
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:13.000]  the X1.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.280]  And it worked pretty good.
[02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:16.600]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2.
[02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:18.480]  You had, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know,
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:20.320]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:23.520]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:26.680]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:28.080]  You know, I could think again.
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:29.880]  I could connect with people again.
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:32.720]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[02:32:32.720 --> 02:32:34.560]  I got my health back and I religiously
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:36.320]  take basically all of your supplements.
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:38.720]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.560]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.760]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:43.480]  It's amazing.
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:44.040]  It works.
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:46.640]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:49.120]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:51.680]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:52.760]  into our own hands.
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:53.960]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:56.080]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:03.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:05.200]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.200]  The answer to 1984.
[02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:18.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:21.120]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:24.840]  Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:30.640]  All right, so the chickens are coming home to roast.
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.080]  FTX is run by the same globalist.
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:38.480]  MI6, CIA, Mossad Mafia, that ran Jeffrey Epstein,
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:41.240]  Gisling Maxwell, and Bill Gates's operation.
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:43.000]  Bill Gates is heavily involved.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.080]  So now the story is up on infowars.com.
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:46.920]  It's getting almost no corporate attention.
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:49.440]  Needs to go viral, US Virgin Islands,
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:53.840]  Suze JPMorgan Chase, claims bank, pulling the levers of Epstein
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:56.040]  Trafficking Network.
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:58.520]  Did you hear that?
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:00.720]  We pointed out two years ago, in a special report
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:03.440]  with whistleblowers, that they're still running the Epstein
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:06.200]  airline out of New York, with stewardesses
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:09.680]  that look like they're 12 years old,
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.080]  that advertise sex with the clients.
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:18.120]  Allsuit also accuses bank of turning a blind eye
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:20.760]  to Epstein pedophiles.
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:24.120]  US Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.360]  followed a lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing banking giant
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:30.920]  JPMorgan Chase of covering up child sex crimes committed
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:36.440]  of a disgraced and deceased billionaire, Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:38.240]  Filed in the Manhattan District Court,
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:41.320]  the suit accuses the bank of knowingly providing
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:44.320]  and pulling the levers through which recruiters and victims
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:45.720]  were paid.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:47.640]  And that was the main bank he used.
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:50.520]  You can see the video, you can see the lawsuit, and more.
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:52.640]  The new lawsuit explicitly states
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:55.880]  that Epstein used his home on Little St. John's
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:58.200]  for sex crimes in June.
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:00.080]  Epstein's former girlfriend, Gisling Maxwell,
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:01.600]  was sentenced to 20 years, president
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.280]  for trafficking minors for sex.
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:06.880]  Epstein's first became a client of Chase in 1998.
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:09.040]  There have been numerous reports since his death
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:11.960]  that the bank's executives sought to keep Epstein on the board
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:14.080]  due to his connections with some of the richest people
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:14.840]  in the world.
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:16.200]  One section of the lawsuit reads,
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:19.040]  human trafficking was the principal business of the accounts
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:20.720]  Epstein maintained with JPMorgan.
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:22.480]  Epstein's accomplices, Gisling Maxwell,
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:23.680]  was sentenced to 20 years.
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:25.960]  Again.
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:30.040]  Now let's tie that together, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:32.800]  A lead crypto fraudster, Sam Bankman-Freed,
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:35.560]  is given judge who oversaw Jeffrey Epstein's case
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:40.120]  and let Kevin Spacey walk.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:42.520]  Look at that guy.
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.640]  Those special districts in New York and DC and Austin,
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:50.720]  they have special judges in charge, special people.
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:54.920]  And it gets worse.
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:57.120]  Federal prosecutors are investigating representative
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.160]  elect George Sandus finances.
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.680]  And yeah, he lied, he admitted he lied.
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:04.280]  I'm not saying he's a good guy.
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:07.040]  But look at all the lies that Biden and all
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:08.840]  of them have told about their resumes.
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  Oh, conservatives don't get too upset about that.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.520]  Emails reveal Sam Bankman-Freed's courtship
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:15.160]  of federal regulators.
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:17.600]  And now top federal regulators are having to step down
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.440]  because they were in business with him.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.760]  FCC announces departure of Dan Berkowitz because of FTX.
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:26.760]  How high does it go?
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:28.680]  Ask Robert Malone.
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:31.360]  Goes all the way to the top.
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:34.880]  Meanwhile, breaking January 6th committee
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:37.920]  withdraws Trump's subpoena because there was nothing there
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:42.320]  and no plan to attack the Capitol.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:45.600]  Let's go ahead now and go back to your phone calls.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:48.080]  Corrine in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:50.040]  Thanks for calling.
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:52.680]  Honored to be talking with you, Alex.
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:55.000]  I've been listening since 2016.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.040]  And I am a financial supporter ever since.
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:36:59.840]  Thank you.
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:03.480]  I'd like to promote your nitric oxide product.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:07.640]  I actually market a competitor for 20 years.
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:10.440]  I've done over $30 million in that product.
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:14.120]  So I know a little bit about nitric oxide.
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:18.160]  And I'd like to say that it's nitric and not nitrous.
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:18.520]  You're right.
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:19.760]  I mispronounce everything.
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  You're right.
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:21.080]  You're right.
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:22.640]  I mispronounce it.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:25.800]  Nitrous oxide is laugh and gas.
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.760]  And nitric oxide is the key signaling molecule
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:32.680]  to the entire cardiovascular system.
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:35.120]  So I think every one of your listeners
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:39.240]  should be buying that product because it protects the ACE
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:43.200]  receptor, which is exactly the problem here that we're having.
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:46.480]  Is the ACE receptors are getting hammered by the virus?
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:46.840]  You're right.
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:48.240]  I always mispronounce everything.
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:49.760]  People got to forgive me about that.
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.240]  It's nitric oxide.
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:55.080]  And all the studies show producing nitric oxide
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:59.280]  in the blood makes the heart, the muscles, everything
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:00.440]  a lot healthier.
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:01.960]  And I've read the studies that so many
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.960]  of these famous marathon runners that
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.640]  drop dead do it because their body runs out of nitric oxide.
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:09.160]  You say you study this.
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:11.360]  Tell us more about it.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:12.280]  Absolutely.
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:13.840]  I would love to.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:19.240]  It is according to the Nobel Prize in Medicine, 1998.
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:23.800]  It is the key signaling molecule to the entire cardiovascular
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:24.680]  system.
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.680]  And it is used by every single cell in the human body.
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.480]  And the reason that we can't generate as much as we get older
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.520]  is because the lining of the arteries, the endothelial lining,
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:37.560]  gets damaged.
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:40.160]  And that's where it gets generated.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.760]  So when you're taking nitric oxide,
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:46.040]  all the other products that your listeners are taking
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:50.520]  work better because it's like putting a pump in a fish tank.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:52.400]  Everything circulates.
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:57.680]  And it regulates the whole arteries and the arterial system.
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:02.600]  So I would have every one of your listeners add that product.
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.480]  And all the other products are going to work better.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:08.080]  And they're going to protect those ACE receptors.
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:10.840]  So I wanted to put that out there before I get
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:11.800]  to my other top.
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:12.440]  Absolutely.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:18.360]  It's nitric boost from M4 Wars, MD, the new product line.
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:21.640]  This is a clone of the company authorizes to it.
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:25.160]  Private label by us of one of the top selling nitric boost
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:28.080]  products in the country, already tested, already loved,
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:29.280]  already five star reviewed.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:30.760]  We're now able to private label it.
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:33.160]  Hope everybody gets nitric boost.
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:38.960]  Available at infowarstore.com under the M4 Wars MD line
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:39.600]  of products.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:42.200]  And then it funds the M4 War, a 360 win.
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:44.680]  Everybody should get nitric boost today.
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:46.920]  What else do you want to add?
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:50.120]  I would like to put out a theory to you.
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:55.880]  And that is that Trump derangement syndrome runs both ways.
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:00.920]  And Mr. Donald Trump, do you remember him telling us
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:04.720]  that he was going to cure cancer in 10 years?
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.920]  Yes, he was going to expose the FDA for blocking
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:12.640]  a lot of treatments, yes.
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:14.000]  I disagree.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.440]  I think that he has been in on mRNA from the beginning
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:24.680]  and that he was not fooled at all.
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:28.040]  When he first went in, he hired loyalists.
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.560]  And then he fired them all and he hired the swamp.
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:36.160]  Like JFK Jr. got out and then he got in bed with Fauci.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:40.440]  And I think there's like 300 different vaccines
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:42.160]  in the pipeline right now.
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:44.360]  And they're all mRNA based.
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:48.320]  And I think they told him he was going to cure cancer.
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.440]  And why else would he say that?
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.320]  Oh, he definitely got on board with it.
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.360]  And I was excited when he first said that right
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:55.840]  before he got elected.
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:58.600]  But it's true that he's pigheaded and won't admit he was wrong.
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:00.800]  And no, I don't think you're speculating.
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:01.800]  You're on record.
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:07.880]  He's on record saying I'm going to get rid of all these blockages
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:12.000]  of people trying to stop drugs getting approved quicker.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  I think you called it the right to fight
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.400]  act so that people that are already terminal
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  could take any drug they want.
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:17.880]  Well, I agree.
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:19.560]  If someone wants to take a risk, they
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:21.360]  should be able to take any experimental drug they want.
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:23.600]  But it doesn't mean it should be forced and mandated.
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:25.240]  And Trump came out and agreed to that.
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:28.640]  So he's a lot better than Joe Biden.
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:30.920]  And don't blame Biden for mandating it,
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:34.240]  because you can't mandate something that doesn't exist.
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:35.160]  OK?
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:38.200]  And if he had not pulled together the military
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:43.120]  pharmaceutical industrial complex and bankrolled them
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:45.360]  and brought this forward nine months,
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.480]  none of us would be taking it.
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:48.800]  No, you're right.
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:50.000]  I was going for memory.
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.800]  It's not the right to fight act.
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:53.720]  It's the right to try act.
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:54.320]  Go ahead.
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:56.480]  Well, then why didn't he tell us about that when it was
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:59.560]  about hydrochloroquine and when it was about ivermectin?
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:02.480]  He could have said, listen, we have a right to try act.
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:05.240]  But he didn't.
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:07.960]  I think he's been in on it from the beginning.
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:10.640]  How in the world could he not come out
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:12.440]  against it at this point?
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:13.000]  I hear you.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:14.080]  That's the area you went.
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:16.160]  All we know is he's not coming out against it now.
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:17.440]  And DeSantis is.
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:19.480]  DeSantis has criminal investigation
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:21.680]  now officially launched by the state of Florida,
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:22.960]  authorized by the Supreme Court.
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:24.040]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:27.520]  The German vice presidents launched a criminal investigation.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.040]  So the globalists had better be worried.
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:30.560]  And these are big victories.
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:33.560]  Everybody should be very satisfied, but keep pushing harder.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:34.000]  All right.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.560]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:35.960]  All right.
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:37.560]  We've got to move fast through calls now.
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:41.680]  Stephanie, you're up next when we return on the other side
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:44.800]  than Brian and so many others.
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:48.720]  Straight ahead, your phone calls after this quick break.
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:49.640]  Stay with us.
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:52.720]  Band.video is full of not just our videos,
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:58.080]  but hundreds of other band people posting band material.
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:01.480]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:04.120]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:07.800]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:11.760]  to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:16.360]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:19.200]  that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.440]  And I've got to tell you, all our supplements are great,
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:24.360]  but we've got a real game changer now.
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.680]  We've never put anything out this powerful.

[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.640]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:04.160]  to introduce to you the Wellness Company,
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:08.000]  an alternative healthcare system for this COVID
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  and post COVID world where trust has been lost
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:15.520]  in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:20.440]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:24.800]  providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:28.840]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:32.960]  treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:35.440]  post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes,
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:40.360]  and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:44.040]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products,
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:48.600]  an online store, media, and health advice.

[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:57.120]  to the Wellness Company.
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:00.800]  Why does the establishment spend so much time
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:04.160]  demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:05.440]  and our other hosts?
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:07.600]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:09.160]  They know we're telling the truth.
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:10.720]  They know we've got their number.
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:15.400]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:18.560]  And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:20.840]  that will supercharge our body's stamina,
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:23.280]  libido, energy, and immune systems.
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:25.440]  And we came out many years ago
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.360]  with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.520]  like preglenone and so much more

[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:44.760]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:47.080]  This is Real Red Pill Plus,

[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:30.200]  Remember, people, we're here on the spot.
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:35.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas,
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.

[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:42.000]  can get the genie out of the bottle.

[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  Only you can break the back of the sensors.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:48.800]  And you see, as we told you,
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:51.200]  international spy agencies, corporations,
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:56.000]  surveilling and censoring people in a mass scale.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.400]  And now the real battle's joined.
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.800]  This is a true Info War.
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:01.000]  Stephanie in California, thanks for calling.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.600]  You're on the air.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:04.200]  Hey, Alex, I wanted to tell you
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:06.800]  to send a bill in California.
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:09.200]  It's going to take us back in a couple of days.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.000]  It starts in 2023.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.400]  But I also have an idea to possibly stop these shots
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:16.800]  dead in their tracks, but really quickly,
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.200]  let me just cut down the Senate bill at Senate Bill 960.
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:24.800]  It's going to start in a next year, a couple of days, 2023,
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:26.800]  and it will allow in the state of California
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:30.200]  to non-citizens become police officers,
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:34.000]  sheriffs, and hold other law enforcement positions
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:35.800]  in the state of California.
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:36.800]  So this is what's going to happen.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.800]  And that's to give the UN NGOs the power to be police.
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:41.800]  Yes, I'm aware of the legislation.
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:43.400]  Pretty crazy.
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:45.200]  Yeah, they're going to start, you know,
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:48.200]  our law enforcement are quitting because of problems
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:49.800]  due to the shots.
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:54.600]  So they're going to slowly read in UN troops
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:59.400]  and Chinese nationals that are in UN positions
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.400]  and in the troops positions into our law enforcement positions.
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:05.800]  Well, they already got Chinese Communist police stations
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:07.000]  set up across the country.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.600]  Again, you can't make any of this up.
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:12.200]  Yeah, this is how they're just reading it in
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:14.000]  and it's going to spread out through the entire country.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  They literally don't have to attack us.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.800]  They're literally just moving the enemy
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:21.400]  right into these positions, right under our noses.
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:24.200]  But really quickly, when it comes to the shot,
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.000]  I applaud, you know, Thomas Renz in going through all the courts
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.800]  and everything to try and get these shots stopped.
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:34.200]  But the problem is that the doctors in the Vera system
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:36.600]  only reports like 1% of the deaths.
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:38.200]  And the doctors are being silenced
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:41.000]  because they're being threatened to tell them
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:42.800]  that, you know, you can't report these deaths.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:46.400]  But the thing is they can't silence the patient.
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:51.000]  So we have over 100 million people jabbed in the United States.
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  What I want the jab to do is to go to their doctors
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.800]  and ask for an AIDS test and a blood clot test.
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:04.400]  I think there's a microquat blood test called the D. Geimer test.
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.200]  That's right. Now, we've had doctors on about that.
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:07.600]  A lot of people that have taken the shot
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:09.800]  are testing positive for HIV now
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:12.400]  because it has the spike protein is from the HIV
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.200]  and they're also testing positive for blood clots.
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:18.600]  In fact, they've done studies in Canada, the U.S. all over
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:21.200]  where people take the Moderna or Pfizer shot
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.800]  and don't have a D. Geimer positive
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.800]  and then days after they have a blood clot positive.
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:27.800]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:29.800]  Thank you for the call. Great points.
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:32.200]  Really smart caller, folks. You got to listen to her.
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.600]  Brian in Idaho, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:38.600]  Hey, Alex, I wanted to ask you about something Kanye said
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:41.400]  on your show about the committee of 300
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:45.000]  and the book that Dr. John Coleman wrote in the early 90s
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  which the CIA posts in PDF on his website.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.800]  How accurate is that book?
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:53.000]  How does it tie into the World Economic Forum
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.800]  and where is Dr. Coleman today? Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:58.600]  I don't thank you. I don't know if Dr. Coleman is still alive.
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:03.400]  I interviewed Dr. Coleman probably six, seven, eight times.
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:06.800]  I think the last time I interviewed him was like 15 years ago or so
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:08.800]  and I was never able to get him back on.
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:10.400]  Last time I heard he was sick.
[02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:12.000]  That was a long time ago.
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:15.000]  But the committee of 300 is dead on.
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  If you look at the Trilateral Commission or you look at the CFR,
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.400]  or you look at the Club of Rome or you look at the WEF
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:26.600]  or you look at the Knights of the Royal Family in England
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:29.600]  and if you look at who is on the boards
[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:31.800]  of all these different globalist groups,
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:34.000]  it's the same hundred people or so
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.800]  that are on all the boards and the key chairmanship
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:38.200]  and there's a couple hundred under them.
[02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:41.000]  So Bilderberg usually has about 120 members.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  Another hundred or so guests, that's 120 people at it.
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:48.800]  But yeah, he worked for MI6.
[02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:52.400]  I think Dr. Coleman was absolutely dead on with what he said.
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:57.200]  I mean, I read his book 25 years ago.
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:51:59.800]  Conspirators hierarchy, the true story.
[02:51:59.800 --> 02:52:01.400]  Put it back up on the screen for me, thanks.
[02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:04.400]  Conspirators hierarchy, the true story of the committee of 300,
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:06.700]  Dr. John Coleman and then they put that back up.
[02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:09.600]  Great job. I guess they found one of my interviews with him.
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:13.400]  infowars.com, John Coleman and let me guess,
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:14.800]  is that still on YouTube?
[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:16.400]  Where'd you guys find that?
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:18.800]  Yeah, let's show the YouTube channel
[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:21.000]  because a lot of old stuff, 10, 15, 20 years old
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:22.400]  is still on YouTube.
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:26.000]  Everything 10 years and back has been erased.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:30.500]  So go ahead and take the bug down so I can see the view count.
[02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:34.300]  John, Dr. John Coleman breaks down to 300 on Alex Jones.
[02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:42.900]  Show, Greg Berry's channel and only 1,400 views.
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:44.700]  Very, very important.
[02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:47.800]  And yeah, I see that last interview with him,
[02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:51.000]  I guess was 13 years ago then.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.600]  I said 15 years, 13 years.
[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:54.700]  So there you go.
[02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:56.600]  Great call, great point.
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:58.100]  Let's go to JD and Indiana.
[02:52:58.100 --> 02:53:00.000]  Go ahead.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.200]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:05.500]  I want to talk about beating the new world order.
[02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:09.000]  I definitely believe in my opinion, it's the youth.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:12.300]  We have to take back the culture of our children.
[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:17.400]  I watched as a kid, every single kid that was in my class
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:20.300]  was on some kind of medication.
[02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:23.900]  And they were all crazy no matter which school I went to.
[02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:27.500]  And even my uncle was on those medications in the 60s and the 70s.
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:28.300]  Absolutely.
[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:31.900]  And Ritalin fries the brain, retards growth, causes heart problems.
[02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:33.700]  It's just a crime.
[02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:34.700]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:53:34.700 --> 02:53:37.100]  And I think, you know, the one thing that we have to do,
[02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:39.200]  my 13-year-old daughter, she loves you.
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:42.300]  She wears her Info War T-shirt to school.
[02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:44.500]  And so I think it comes down to the youth.
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:49.300]  We have to take back our youth and they put in a long-term goal.
[02:53:49.300 --> 02:53:51.100]  We have to have that same long-term goal.
[02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:54.200]  We have to look at our children that way and educate our children
[02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:56.900]  to be honest with them about what's going on.
[02:53:56.900 --> 02:53:59.000]  Because we are living in dangerous times.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.700]  When they're smart enough to understand that,
[02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:03.000]  we have to train them how to grow food.
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:06.000]  So we have to get back our children's minds,
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.200]  get them away from screens, spend time with them.
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:12.500]  The real fight is for the hearts and minds and souls of our children.
[02:54:12.500 --> 02:54:13.300]  Absolutely.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:16.100]  Because if we don't do that, if we don't take back our youth,
[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:18.500]  if we don't take back our kids, they're going to keep corrupting them.
[02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:22.200]  Because like I said, if my mother would have put me on those same drugs,
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:24.100]  I would be just as bad.
[02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:25.400]  I mean, imagine where I would be.
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:27.200]  A lot of these guys are all drug addicts.
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:31.600]  None of them that I know are not drug addicts because of what they've done to them.
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:34.400]  And I'd like to add one point about J6 dollars.
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:35.800]  I started this thing, man.
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:39.800]  Everybody should wear tariff handcuffs on one side of their wrist
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:41.800]  until they send everyone home.
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:44.400]  Because it was terrible for them being locked up for Christmas.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:44.800]  That's right.
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:48.100]  They are setting the precedent for political prisoners
[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:51.900]  and kangaroo courts with what's happening with the J6 political prisoners.
[02:54:51.900 --> 02:54:52.800]  Great point, sir.
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:53.700]  God bless you.
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:55.400]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:55.400 --> 02:54:57.100]  All right, let's talk to Mike in New York.
[02:54:57.100 --> 02:54:58.400]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.300]  Yes, Alex.
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:02.700]  I just wanted to bring up, years ago, there was a Star Trek episode.
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:04.800]  I believe Pike was the captain even.
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.500]  And they speak about eugenics and a vaccination and exterminating the human race.
[02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:11.400]  Do you know of the episode?
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  I've watched most of those episodes.
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:15.000]  Yes.
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.600]  And there's also the episode with Khan where there was a nuclear war
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:21.700]  and they created genetic engineering.
[02:55:21.700 --> 02:55:23.100]  And yes.
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:24.700]  He actually says eugenics.
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:26.300]  Yes.
[02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:30.300]  So I was just wondering, so at what point do we reverse any of this?
[02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:35.300]  Because from what I understand, the actual mRNA gene splicing is actually
[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:37.600]  like a high school level, biological level.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.800]  So how do we get some real scientists involved, you know, McCullins and these guys
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:43.000]  and switch this around?
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:48.500]  Because as far as I see it, we're almost heaven, West Virginia,
[02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:53.100]  Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
[02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:54.400]  What do you think?
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:55.100]  I like that one.
[02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:57.100]  You kind of shifted gears real quick.
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:55:59.100]  I'm kind of confused.
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:01.900]  Well, no, I'm just saying in general, how are we going to reverse this?
[02:56:01.900 --> 02:56:03.000]  How are we going to bring it back?
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.700]  Well, I mean, look, they admit Star Trek was total conditioning for the UN takeover.
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:08.400]  Sounds great.
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:09.800]  Everybody's coming by.
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:13.300]  The Star Trek Starfleet symbol is the UN symbol.
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:16.800]  And so they sold everybody on this utopia of world government.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:17.500]  But you're right.
[02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:20.900]  They've got mRNA technology and stuff that actually does cure cancer.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:22.600]  They're not going to give us that.
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:26.000]  They give us spike protein blood clots day one.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:26.500]  Exactly.
[02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:30.300]  The venom, the way snakes, blood clots, the veins.
[02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:31.500]  Alex, you've been right all along.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.100]  What are we, what are we to do next?
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:35.300]  I think you've been raised.
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:37.600]  Brother, it's what we're doing.
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:38.600]  We got to care about each other.
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:39.900]  We got to learn about the new world order.
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:41.800]  We got to build our new systems.
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:45.200]  We got to warn everybody out there that, hey, they're going to cut the power off.
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:46.300]  They're going to take your resources.
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:50.300]  They're going to get you under their control so they can dictate your surrender.
[02:56:50.300 --> 02:56:51.600]  That's really all this is.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:52.700]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:53.500]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:54.300]  Start the next hour.
[02:56:54.300 --> 02:56:57.400]  Chas, Lauren and Gary are our final callers.
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:59.100]  Then I've got some final news.
[02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:02.800]  I'm going to hand the baton to a great talk show host, the middle of the night and the
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:07.500]  land down under there in Australia, where they are battling the tyranny at Point Lake
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:08.300]  Range.
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:12.800]  And believe me, places like Israel, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand are the
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:16.500]  front lines of the tyranny, the exact programs they're testing there.
[02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:18.000]  They're trying to bring here.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.700]  So we're not just trying to free our brethren in other countries.
[02:57:20.700 --> 02:57:24.600]  We're fighting for our future here as well and learning about what the enemy is doing.
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:27.300]  The world's a small planet, a small globe.
[02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:28.600]  We're all in this together.
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:32.000]  Orris, Benjamin Franklin said we will hang separate.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.600]  Hour number four straight ahead and then, 3 p.m. central.
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:37.000]  Mark your calendars.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.600]  The great Owen Schreuer, Harrison Smith and more with the war room.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:44.800]  3 p.m. central at info wars dot com.
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:55.300]  I want you to remember two words info wars platinum in the history of info war supplements
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:56.800]  and they're amazing.

[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:03.000]  public.

[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:12.600]  and a supporter.

[02:59:49.200 --> 03:00:07.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:16.720]  We put emphasis on what I said before public private partnerships which we accompany.
[03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:25.720]  So when we define a project like our global educational initiative, I just described it
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:32.240]  in a second, we have under the leadership of Cisco and many other companies, practically
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:41.960]  all the big names, we try to revolutionize the educational system of Jordan, Egypt and
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:53.320]  now Burundi by working together with the local authorities, we work also together with UNESCO
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:01:00.000]  and not only to equip schools but to put, to retrain the teachers, to put the new curriculum
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.120]  into a curriculum into place.
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:09.680]  So we work together with the, we are companies, we do not, such a difference to the Clinton
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:18.520]  initiative which mainly, and which is a good thing, which ask companies to pledge some
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:24.000]  money to make a commitment and some to come back and to report.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:33.600]  We are with the initiative from the beginning to the end, but there is one other difference.
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:41.200]  Special guest is coming up here in just a few minutes, I'm finishing up with your calls
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:45.080]  right now and Alex Jones, your host, Chas in North Carolina, thanks for holding her
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:46.080]  on the ear.
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:47.080]  Hey Alex.
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:48.080]  Go ahead.
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:58.400]  I think 1776 is the answer to a lot more than 1984.
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:07.360]  It is the answer to the WEF and the CFR and the EU and the WHO and Bill Gates and Klaus
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:13.320]  Schwab and as soon as our politicians and our corrupt generals, if they would decide
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:18.800]  that they're going to let blue helmets and foreign invaders come out here and they want
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:26.280]  to utilize that little map and section us off into no-go zones, the answer to that is
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:28.600]  1776.
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:36.400]  As far back as I can go, on my paternal side of my family, a man named John Nutter, fought
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:42.360]  side by side with General George Washington and he helped found the town of Bridgeston,
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:51.440]  Delaware and on my maternal side, I've had grandparents flee the Bolshevik Revolution,
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:58.760]  Polish Jews and German Jews and their children went back to Europe and fought.
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:08.280]  And I'll be daggone if some lunatic in a suit with a big fat bank account is going to cooperate
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:14.160]  with foreign entities and tell me I don't have rights and I don't own a piece of dirt.
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:16.240]  I was here first.
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:17.240]  You know?
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:20.680]  Sir, you're absolutely right and we just have to declare our new Declaration of Independence
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:22.240]  and I love the point you make.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:29.480]  The answer in 1984 isn't just 1776, the answer to the WEF is 1776, the answer to Bill Gates
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:35.600]  is 1776, the answer to force injections is 1776, the answer to open borders is 1776,
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:39.480]  the answer to the pedophile rings is 1776, the answer to them trying to take our guns
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:45.680]  is 1776, the answer to their tyranny is 1776.
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:53.560]  And I've only got one more thing to say with a short plug, outlibertate them, outmortem
[03:03:53.560 --> 03:04:00.040]  me he die, that means give me liberty or give me death.
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:05.880]  And you know, I just want you to know that your turmeric product in combination with
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:13.000]  those high quality fish oils, when you have curcumin in your body, it allows the uptake
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:19.560]  for DHA and EPH or whatever it is, it allows for a higher uptake past the blood brain barrier.
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:26.840]  And when you have curcumin and those compounds in your body, it allows for your brain to stimulate
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:35.520]  new neural growth, it repairs old neurons and it allows for a higher synapsis function
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:36.520]  inside your brain.
[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:37.520]  Absolutely.

[03:06:05.840 --> 03:06:07.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:14.160]  All right, now into hour number four, Oatroyer and the War Room takes over 3PM Central.
[03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:18.600]  Oh, it's taking some deserved time off right now, since the great Harrison Smith sitting
[03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:22.480]  in, or at least that's what he was doing the other day, 3PM Central coming up in about
[03:06:22.480 --> 03:06:24.760]  52 minutes from now, 53 minutes from now.
[03:06:24.760 --> 03:06:27.360]  All right, now let's go to Lauren in California.
[03:06:27.360 --> 03:06:28.360]  Thanks for calling.
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:29.360]  Go ahead.
[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:30.880]  Hi, Alex.
[03:06:30.880 --> 03:06:33.560]  I'm really excited, so I'm kind of nervous.
[03:06:33.560 --> 03:06:36.480]  I've been with you for 15 years for Suncaller.
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:43.280]  I just wanted to do a product plug and let everybody know again who hasn't thought anything
[03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:44.280]  to buy.
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:48.240]  Years ago, I loaded up on the X2, the X2 is amazing.
[03:06:48.240 --> 03:06:56.800]  I think it kind of helps with weight, keeps weight down, keeps you a nice slim figure.
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:06:58.800]  The Super Female Vitality is great.
[03:06:58.800 --> 03:07:02.920]  I work in a wine tasting room, so I'm pouring wine for tons of people.
[03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:07.640]  The BrainForce, the B12, those are my go-to, people are always asking, how do you remember
[03:07:07.640 --> 03:07:08.640]  this?
[03:07:08.640 --> 03:07:09.640]  How do you remember this?
[03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:10.640]  And I'm telling them.
[03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:11.640]  BrainForceInfoWars.com.
[03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:18.920]  Also, being here in California, I'm able to buy local produce.
[03:07:18.920 --> 03:07:19.920]  That's one thing.
[03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:25.520]  I saw this article that said they're going to now start shooting up beef with the mRNA
[03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:26.520]  vaccine.
[03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:30.240]  Well, they're not going to start, they're already vaccinating cows all over the world
[03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:31.240]  with the poison.
[03:07:31.240 --> 03:07:35.280]  So now we're going to be eating spiked protein in the beef.
[03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:36.280]  And what are you going to do?
[03:07:36.280 --> 03:07:42.560]  I'm lucky enough to live in a very agate community, just split half a cow with my family.
[03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:44.560]  If you look at that, it seems like a lot of money, but if you look at it...
[03:07:44.560 --> 03:07:45.560]  You save a lot.
[03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:48.440]  I mean, hell, when you actually buy from the farmers, you get it for like a third the
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:49.440]  price.
[03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:50.440]  Absolutely.
[03:07:50.440 --> 03:07:56.480]  And we've got all this, and I had a roast last night, it was just totally killer.
[03:07:56.480 --> 03:08:01.160]  But basically, that's it, I just want to promote that to people to tell them, you know, there's
[03:08:01.160 --> 03:08:03.120]  a farmer's market everywhere.
[03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:04.520]  Go to your farmer's market.
[03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:09.160]  People need to like learn how to cook again, because you know, when you're going to a farmer's
[03:08:09.160 --> 03:08:11.960]  market, you're getting local produce, seasonal produce.
[03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:13.960]  It's like, what do I do with the button on the floor?
[03:08:13.960 --> 03:08:14.960]  That's right.
[03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:15.960]  None of this is an option.
[03:08:15.960 --> 03:08:16.960]  It's got to be done.
[03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:22.360]  And the more we support farmer's markets, the more we do this, the more we become healthy
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:23.360]  and the bigger the market gets.
[03:08:23.360 --> 03:08:28.120]  I remember when I was a kid, I'd go visit my grandmother in East Texas, probably three
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:31.880]  weeks out of the year when my parents would go on vacation to Europe or Mexico or wherever
[03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:34.040]  they put me in grandma's house.
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:37.440]  And my grandmother was a school teacher and a school administrator.
[03:08:37.440 --> 03:08:39.160]  We had a farm in a ranch as well.
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:45.840]  We mainly raised like cows and pigs and sometimes, you know, a few crops.
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:48.480]  But she didn't go to the grocery store a lot of times.
[03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:52.560]  She would drive around with me to three or four people's houses, and she'd get a big
[03:08:52.560 --> 03:09:03.040]  ol' slab of meat, she'd get just all sorts of black eyed peas or green beans or squash
[03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:04.040]  or whatever.
[03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:05.560]  And then we'd go home and cook that.
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:10.360]  That's what she'd do, just stop at people's houses and buy food and there was dinner.
[03:09:10.360 --> 03:09:12.800]  And so that's what people are supposed to do.
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:13.800]  And that's normal.
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:18.960]  I mean, chickens, chickens, like one of the easiest things you could have, chickens,
[03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:24.240]  eggs, meat, it sounds scary and intimidating, but once you start doing it and live in that
[03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:27.040]  way, it makes a lot of sense.
[03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:28.040]  I love you.
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:32.200]  I'm so glad you're around and I support when I can.
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:35.200]  I'm lucky enough to stay home with my daughter right now.
[03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:40.920]  So we buy when we can, but I love you, Alex, and listen every day.
[03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:42.640]  Well, I love you too, Lauren.
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:43.640]  Thanks for the call.
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:44.640]  Thanks for holding.
[03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:49.160]  Gary in Illinois, last caller before I hand the baton to our guest host.
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:53.760]  Hey, Alex, I want to talk about a couple things first and the most important is keeping
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:54.760]  you on the air.
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:10:04.440]  Back when I was listening in the early 2000s, I wanted more and paid the extra to be able
[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:10.320]  to get, you know, the TV version of it.
[03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:11.320]  Are you hearing me?
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:12.320]  I am.
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:13.320]  You're talking about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:18.160]  And as soon as bandwidth costs went down, we made it free.
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:23.040]  But yeah, the full archive of decades of shows is at PrisonPlanet.tv, still to this day,
[03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:24.040]  for free.
[03:10:24.040 --> 03:10:30.040]  Well, I mean, I'd be the first one to sign up for, say, eight, ten, but some months or
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:31.040]  anything, you know?
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:32.040]  No, I hear you.
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:34.840]  Our model has always been trying to give it up for free, but we're looking at making
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:39.280]  documentaries and special reports and special shows again that are going to be for subscribers.
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:42.040]  So believe me, brother, if you want it, it's coming back.
[03:10:42.040 --> 03:10:43.040]  Right.
[03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:46.880]  Because you give a million people that signed up on there and they just get a little something
[03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:47.880]  there.
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:50.320]  Oh, we'd have no problem funding ourselves if that happened.
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:55.160]  And another thing was, was I had this password that I get to witness to people with the password
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:11:01.040]  and I had, I was able to let eight people watch on my channel that helped a lot, too.
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:05.080]  Well, the subscribers of PrisonPlanet.tv financed so much of what we've done and then things
[03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:07.920]  got really good for us in 2015.
[03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:08.920]  We had plenty of money.
[03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:10.000]  I said, well, it's free now.
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  I don't need money.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:15.720]  Now, today we're barely on air, so that's why we made PrisonPlanet.tv free.
[03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:20.200]  But yes, we are planning on bringing a hybrid program back where like an hour or two is
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:23.640]  free, then a couple hours with special guests, a subscriber.
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:27.880]  I mean, I've got a bunch of offers on other networks and other things.
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:30.280]  I'm trying to keep M4s on the air.
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:32.840]  So we're, you know, we're doing this as best we can.
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:37.480]  But if the enemy thinks they're going to shut us down, they're gravely mistaken.
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:43.520]  They got to kill me or put me in prison or completely shut the web off.
[03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:45.600]  They're not shutting anything down.
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:46.800]  Thanks to your support, brother.
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:49.440]  It's you, the viewers that have decided to keep us on air.
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:50.440]  We really appreciate it.
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:51.440]  Anything else, Gary?
[03:11:51.440 --> 03:11:52.440]  Oh, yeah.
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:53.440]  That's a great reason stuff.
[03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:58.080]  I'd like to see a squad of generals in the military start fulfilling their roles and
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:02.760]  maybe take a few put things around the world and even start military criminals or just
[03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:04.280]  taking care of business.
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:07.280]  Well, I mean, that's where things are headed.
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:10.800]  So we do have Nuremberg to getting fired up in Europe with the German vice president.
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:16.560]  We do have criminal investigations, declaration of independence, and I'm not calling for violence
[03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:20.360]  at this point, and I'm not going to offensively start anything.
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:24.440]  But yes, we have the second amendment as an emergency backup for a reason.
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:28.880]  And the idea they're trying to demonize that is because the tyrants know they're planning
[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:33.840]  on pushing stuff so bad that they're trying to force us into violent confrontation.
[03:12:33.840 --> 03:12:38.760]  That's why we should keep our powder dry, my friend.
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:40.320]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:41.640]  All right.
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:45.560]  I really want to thank the viewers and listeners for tuning in today.
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:49.960]  Ward Willing, I'll be back at 11 a.m. central tomorrow.
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:53.680]  I'm very humble and very blessed to have been so successful against the enemy.
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:58.240]  All of that credit goes to God and the viewers and listeners of the show that have made it
[03:12:58.240 --> 03:12:59.240]  possible.
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:05.000]  Maria Z at Z Media with three ZEE Media.com tech suburbs.
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.600]  She's a leading light in Australia battling tyranny.
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:10.800]  We're going to break in two and a half minutes, but I wanted her to take over and I'll give
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:12.960]  people a prelude to what she's about to cover.
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:15.440]  Maria, thanks for being here.
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:17.320]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:22.560]  And isn't it amazing to see the power of truth all around the world?
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:26.880]  People are gathering to tell the truth and listen to the truth.
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:32.320]  And this is why the globalists are fighting so hard to shut info wars up and to shut all
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:33.520]  of us up.
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:38.960]  There is some really amazing news that's come out of Australia where they are now referring
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:40.120]  to us as terrorists.
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:42.680]  Alex covered this just the other day.
[03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:49.120]  And I want to talk about what actually led to the police talking about monitoring online
[03:13:49.120 --> 03:13:56.720]  conspiracy theorist accounts and how they're actually painting anti-vaxxers as terrorists.
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:01.760]  Similar actions that have happened in New Zealand and something that's coming out of
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:07.480]  China, which I think is very, very strange, the mainstream media talking about the worst
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:13.680]  pandemic ever out of China, millions upon millions of cases.
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:19.440]  But yet China's opening its borders and we're going to start getting people leaving China
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:21.520]  again, coming into different countries.
[03:14:21.520 --> 03:14:25.240]  Is this their way of trying to create a new pandemic?
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:29.000]  People will dig into that a lot more later on in the show.
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:38.240]  But just to touch on that truth point, I was reflecting on the first time that I actually
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:44.120]  hosted the Alex Jones show and I'm so grateful to the team and to Alex for connecting people
[03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:49.840]  all around the world like this, connecting me with their viewers, connecting other people
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:54.840]  with their viewers and their listeners because this is a globally coordinated plan.
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:14:58.280]  It's a global takeover that we're witnessing.
[03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:04.800]  And so it is so important to hear from the tactics from every different country because
[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:10.400]  what happens here first will come to you if it's successful.
[03:15:10.400 --> 03:15:15.080]  You know, Alex was just speaking about the fact that people are starting to become aware
[03:15:15.080 --> 03:15:18.160]  of 15 minute cities.
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:22.280]  When I first hosted the Alex Jones show, I came and I spoke to everyone about the Melbourne
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:27.640]  experiment, the United Nations boasting about how the Melbourne lockdowns were so great
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:31.880]  for the climate and they're going to use it in future for climate lockdowns to build
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:34.400]  your digital prison.
[03:15:34.400 --> 03:15:37.720]  We'll talk about that a little bit as well, but I'm just so grateful.
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:42.600]  I'm so grateful that people around the world are starting to realize what is happening
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:44.640]  and that's what we've needed from the beginning.
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:49.680]  We need worldwide resistance to this global takeover and I believe it's happening.
[03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:57.280]  I'll be back with you right on the other side of this break to talk about that more.
[03:15:57.280 --> 03:16:04.000]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:08.600]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:13.040]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:17.880]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:21.440]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:16:21.440 --> 03:16:28.040]  You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:33.200]  getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and
[03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:36.160]  other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:40.080]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:44.800]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:03.480]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing info wars attacking myself and
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:05.520]  the crew and our other hosts?
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:07.360]  Because they know we're pro human.
[03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:09.080]  They know we're telling the truth.

[03:19:58.600 --> 03:20:13.240]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.240 --> 03:20:15.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:16.920]  I'm your guest host Maria Z.
[03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:23.440]  Now the last time that I was on here, I spoke about the propaganda that the W E F released
[03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:30.920]  and the W H O and it was a doctor talking about anti science aggression and the fact
[03:20:30.920 --> 03:20:40.080]  that or anti vax aggression now is a killing force globally saying that it is responsible
[03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:48.440]  and I quote according to them for more death than gun violence and global terrorism.
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:55.720]  So they've started to compare anti vaxes, what they call anti vaxes, which is people
[03:20:55.720 --> 03:21:02.840]  that want to withhold their participation in a Frankenstein medical experiment.
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:08.880]  They're calling them terrorists and it's not the first time that we've heard this term.
[03:21:08.880 --> 03:21:10.640]  New Zealand's been doing it for a little while.
[03:21:10.640 --> 03:21:13.600]  I'm going to go over that but it's coming for every country.
[03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:16.880]  Canada started doing this as well as Alex said the other day.
[03:21:16.880 --> 03:21:21.640]  It's happening all over the world, but what sparked this particular video that I'm going
[03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:27.640]  to show you in a moment from Australia was a story that we heard in the mainstream media
[03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:34.480]  about two crazy conspiracy theorists, three, sorry, living on a property.
[03:21:34.480 --> 03:21:41.720]  And apparently, you know, the police went into it, initially conduct a welfare check.
[03:21:41.720 --> 03:21:47.280]  And we were told that they went to investigate a missing person, then we were told that they
[03:21:47.280 --> 03:21:55.480]  had a warrant for these persons arrest because a police officer months ago, listen to this,
[03:21:55.480 --> 03:22:02.320]  saw this person crossing a border when unvaccinated people were not allowed to cross a border.
[03:22:02.320 --> 03:22:04.960]  They thought this person had weapons.
[03:22:04.960 --> 03:22:09.680]  He had a gun license but apparently he had more weapons than he was permitted to have
[03:22:09.680 --> 03:22:12.600]  but they didn't do anything about it at the time.
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:18.680]  So later on, they got a warrant for his arrest something like 12 months later.
[03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:25.440]  What they're doing is talking about tighter border controls now to make sure that unvaccinated
[03:22:25.440 --> 03:22:31.080]  people, if we have a situation like that again, unvaccinated people can't travel, you know,
[03:22:31.080 --> 03:22:33.120]  can't be traveling borders like that.
[03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:38.120]  And they've painted these people as these crazy off grid living in a remote location.
[03:22:38.120 --> 03:22:44.480]  So I'm just telling you the official narrative that's changed about 400 times a day since
[03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:45.480]  the story came out.
[03:22:45.480 --> 03:22:48.880]  And of course, I'm exaggerating here, but you understand what I mean.
[03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:51.560]  They've told us that they're part of some cult.
[03:22:51.560 --> 03:22:58.920]  They've also said, you know, that they were Christians, Armageddon type, you know, apocalyptic
[03:22:58.920 --> 03:23:06.520]  type beliefs, posting videos online about their apocalyptic beliefs.
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:11.480]  Well I saw a couple of those videos, I can't say I saw them all, but you know, they were
[03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:14.840]  just sort of talking about what the Bible says is going to happen in the end time.
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:23.040]  So things that a lot of people talk about online and they've said that, you know, these
[03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:28.400]  people are living off grid in a remote location, you know, crazy off gridder.
[03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:33.280]  So trying to scare people away from living off grid.
[03:23:33.280 --> 03:23:37.760]  And the house is, the house backs on to a school apparently.
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:42.280]  So that's not really this insane remote location.
[03:23:42.280 --> 03:23:47.600]  And you know, interestingly enough, we've had, we've heard reports that the property
[03:23:47.600 --> 03:23:52.400]  was trying to be bought up by the government for some time because there's a crucial gas
[03:23:52.400 --> 03:23:55.280]  line there that the property's on.
[03:23:55.280 --> 03:24:02.560]  And apparently the family was being harassed for quite some time by police who later on
[03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:05.520]  admitted that they'd been there several times.
[03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:09.680]  And of course you won't hear this on the mainstream media.
[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:16.080]  And you know, two inexperienced officers apparently have gone in, there's been a shootout and
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:19.560]  we've been told that these people were crazy insane killers.
[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:26.520]  Now I'm not supposed to talk to you impartially about this situation because me applying my
[03:24:26.520 --> 03:24:33.560]  critical thinking means I'm a terrorist according to my government.
[03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:39.920]  I'm not allowed to pick apart this story and pick apart the parts that the mainstream media
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:45.760]  just don't make sense about, which is anything that they report because they're liars, because
[03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:52.440]  they're funded by Bill Gates, you know, the Guardian has the gall to ask for donations
[03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:59.560]  on their page saying that they, they're independent and they need funding to keep going.
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:07.240]  When they received $10 million, over $10 million reportedly in grants from Bill Gates to report
[03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:15.600]  on how great the COVID-19 injections are, and you want to put up a please pay me to
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:20.880]  keep reporting, to keep shilling for Bill Gates.
[03:25:20.880 --> 03:25:22.920]  These people can't be trusted.
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:28.800]  And so what the Australian police have responded with, if the team can queue up that video
[03:25:28.800 --> 03:25:34.840]  right now of the Australian police, I want to show you how they're painting people right
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:39.520]  now and what they're, how they're trying to scare us from even talking about this.
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:40.680]  I'll let the video go.
[03:25:40.680 --> 03:25:46.520]  So they're still looking at things like religiously motivated extremism, ideological, motivated
[03:25:46.520 --> 03:25:53.320]  extremism, issue-motivated extremism, grievance-fuelled violence, and even pathological-fuelled
[03:25:53.320 --> 03:25:54.320]  violence.
[03:25:54.320 --> 03:25:58.400]  Are you horribly concerned, I guess, after seeing something like this, if there's a
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:03.640]  attack on police and the rise in kind of conspiracy theories of the start of COVID, is that something
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:05.800]  that police are concerned about?
[03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:06.800]  Of course.
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:07.800]  Of course.
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:08.800]  It might have cost the country.
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:15.360]  I mean, part of my role is in counter-terrorism and we meet nationally with the Australian
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:19.360]  Counter-Terrorism Committee and discuss these issues regularly.
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:26.200]  So we do investigate and monitor people who demonstrate and we know show concerning behaviour.
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:30.640]  Or if it's anybody out there that knows of someone that might be showing concerning
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:38.600]  behaviour around conspiracy theories, anti-government, anti-police, conspiracy theories around COVID-19
[03:26:38.600 --> 03:26:42.240]  vaccination, as what we're seeing with the Trained Family, we'd want to know that.
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:47.720]  And you can either contact police directly or go through crime stoppers.
[03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:53.640]  What we can see is sentiment displayed by the three individuals or three Trained Family
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:27:00.720]  members that appears anti-government, anti-police, conspiracy theorist type things.
[03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:05.760]  So in all of the social media postings, we'll be looking at who are the other people posting
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:11.240]  material, who are the people that own those sites, where are they located, and then we'll
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:14.920]  go and speak to them.
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:19.440]  Now I'm not saying that this family was innocent.
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:26.480]  I'm not saying that, you know, some of what the mainstream media has said about this story
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:28.280]  is not true.
[03:27:28.280 --> 03:27:29.960]  I mean, who knows?
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:33.160]  The point is you cannot trust the media.
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:38.400]  And as much as the government would like me to not say these words because apparently
[03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:42.960]  that makes me dangerous, you cannot trust the government.
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:50.200]  And they're ramping up trying to make people afraid to speak or think critically or pick
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:59.440]  apart a situation and, you know, allocating counter-terrorism teams to monitor anti-vax
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:04.720]  conspiracy theories, which they regard as concerning behavior.
[03:28:04.720 --> 03:28:10.440]  So, you know, like we showed from the WHO, they're saying that this anti-vax aggression
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:16.000]  is a killing force responsible for more death-than-gun violence and global terrorism.
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:23.760]  And now the Australian police are calling for people to report anyone that is anti-government,
[03:28:23.760 --> 03:28:30.560]  that is, you know, what did they say, anti-government or anti-police to crime stoppers or their
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:40.160]  local police station because you have questions about the people, public servants, that reportedly
[03:28:40.160 --> 03:28:48.000]  serve you, who are paid by your taxes to serve you and to answer to the public.
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:50.280]  You're not allowed to do that anymore.
[03:28:50.280 --> 03:28:52.880]  Well, then I'd like my taxes back, please.

[03:32:59.120 --> 03:33:13.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:14.240]  Welcome back everyone.
[03:33:14.240 --> 03:33:20.240]  We're talking about how the globalists are labeling us as crazy terrorists conspiracy
[03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:25.480]  theorists and extremists and how this all started in Australia.
[03:33:25.480 --> 03:33:30.840]  The reason I told you the back story of what happened here was because basically we're
[03:33:30.840 --> 03:33:36.560]  being treated as though we can't talk about this and we're crazy if we do you know even
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:41.960]  in Canada if you look up the term psychosis it gives the example of someone who thinks
[03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:46.280]  that their government is trying to hurt them and so the globalists are trying to make us
[03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:54.400]  afraid to speak the truth and I simply refuse to back down I refuse to be afraid to tell
[03:33:54.400 --> 03:33:59.480]  the truth because the truth is so powerful and I started you know this this particular
[03:33:59.480 --> 03:34:06.600]  broadcast off with that it really is the truth doesn't need to defend itself as in it doesn't
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:12.720]  need to justify itself it defends itself and the truth cuts through the lies and it cuts
[03:34:12.720 --> 03:34:17.480]  through their BS and that's all this is it's just BS it's fear tactics it's trying to scare
[03:34:17.480 --> 03:34:22.120]  you but they are and I cannot deny they are operating in lockstep and I want to talk to
[03:34:22.120 --> 03:34:29.600]  you about New Zealand you know Jacinda Ardern I like to call her jab cinder this woman is
[03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:37.600]  a real psychopath she is a very very talented actress fooled a lot of the world into thinking
[03:34:37.600 --> 03:34:42.520]  she was a good woman particularly with how she dealt with the Christ Church situation
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:48.720]  but just like we saw with 9 11 just like we saw with what happened in Christ Church and
[03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:53.920]  just like we saw with what happened recently with this shooting in Australia there are
[03:34:53.920 --> 03:35:01.720]  more laws calling for for example with the Patriot Act in 9 11 in New Zealand they're
[03:35:01.720 --> 03:35:06.880]  talking about how they're going to combat extremism following the Christ Church situation
[03:35:06.880 --> 03:35:12.480]  and in Australia you know more gun reforms we've already got incredibly strict gun laws
[03:35:12.480 --> 03:35:20.280]  here but they want more gun reforms and so New Zealand security services launched an
[03:35:20.280 --> 03:35:27.680]  initiative recently to help the public identify warning signs of violent extremism this was
[03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:33.800]  in October of this year and they said that their secret service is launching an initiative
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:40.360]  to help them identify people who may have been radicalized the guide is know the signs
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:46.640]  a guide for identifying signs of violent extremism details dozens of indicators that a friend
[03:35:46.640 --> 03:35:53.200]  or family member could be planning a terror attack I mean the stuff that's in this guide
[03:35:53.200 --> 03:35:57.040]  I don't know if the team can find it while I'm talking I've got it up here but I'm just
[03:35:57.040 --> 03:36:03.840]  going to read some of it to you the the mindsets and ideologies it's called know the signs New
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:12.040]  Zealand mindset and ideology consumes violent extremist videos media music or messaging
[03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:17.640]  but what is it that they consider violent extremist videos media music or messaging
[03:36:17.640 --> 03:36:25.360]  well they consider conspiracy theories violent extremism they consider it a global killing
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:34.040]  force they consider themselves at war with the people who think that these injections
[03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:43.400]  may be harmful who dare to say that out loud who dare to say hmm maybe this story here
[03:36:43.400 --> 03:36:49.280]  that the government is using in order to bring in more laws and monitor conspiracy theorists
[03:36:49.280 --> 03:37:00.600]  doesn't really add up identifies with a violent extremist cause well we know from what they've
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:10.040]  told us that they think that anti-vax activism is an extremist cause oh so I am against people
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:17.120]  being killed by this death shot so now I'm an extremist look at that face that is the
[03:37:17.120 --> 03:37:24.200]  face of evil right there what a oh I can't stand looking at it develops a hostile us versus
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:32.480]  them worldview I mean this very broadcast everything that I'm saying could be perceived
[03:37:32.480 --> 03:37:41.520]  in that manner no I'm not against government I'm not against police I'm against corruption
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:46.720]  I'm against a global takeover I'm against government officials getting up in the media
[03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:52.560]  every single day reading us cases that mean nothing because the PCR test cannot distinguish
[03:37:52.560 --> 03:38:00.320]  between a simple cold a sniffle and covert whatever that is and telling us that we need
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:09.440]  to go and get injected or we can't leave our houses and then denying or refusing to talk
[03:38:09.440 --> 03:38:14.640]  about the excess mortality rates as a result of those injections that's what I'm against
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:24.280]  I'm against murderers doing that and that is what they are supports the use of violence
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:30.480]  to further their cause well every single broadcast that I listen to and including my broadcast
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:39.600]  have never once called for violence we just want justice the right way lawfully peacefully
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:47.160]  we want justice and criminals to be held accountable for what they've done and expresses a willingness
[03:38:47.160 --> 03:38:53.520]  or desire to die on behalf of a violent extremist cause I've heard many people say this is the
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:58.760]  hill that I'm going to die on and that could easily be misconstrued by these people you
[03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:08.360]  know something that is actually quite noble and it is to fight against a globalist terrorist
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:15.000]  organisation that is the New World Order by standing up to them with truth if the team
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:24.080]  can queue up the video of Jacinda Ardern declaring that we are at war with the people
[03:39:24.080 --> 03:39:32.360]  will also be an advocate to address the weapons that are new after all the face of war has
[03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:40.640]  changed and with that the weapons used this is no longer a hypothetical the weapons of
[03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:46.680]  war have changed they are upon us and require the same level of action and activity that
[03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:53.480]  we put into the weapons of old and surely we can start with violent extremism and terrorist
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:40:00.200]  content online we're also focused on prevention understanding the interactions between online
[03:40:00.200 --> 03:40:05.360]  environments and the real world that can lead to radicalisation as leaders were rightly
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:11.680]  concerned that even the most light touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:18.320]  as being hostile to values of free speech that we value so highly after all how do you
[03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:24.600]  successfully end a war if people are led to believe the reason for its existence is not
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:31.720]  only legal but noble how do you tackle climate change if people do not believe it exists
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:36.600]  how do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld when they are subjected to hateful
[03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:43.560]  and dangerous rhetoric and ideology the weapons may be different but the goals of those who
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:49.400]  perpetuate them is often the same to cause chaos and reduce the ability of others to
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:55.520]  defend themselves to disband communities to collapse the collective strength of countries
[03:40:55.520 --> 03:41:13.520]  who work together she got a standing ovation there for telling the world that we are at
[03:41:13.520 --> 03:41:18.360]  war with the people with those that spread what they call misinformation with those
[03:41:18.360 --> 03:41:23.480]  that deny climate change repeatedly saying that we are at war we are at war it's them
[03:41:23.480 --> 03:41:30.480]  declaring war on us not the other way around they are the ones who declared war first when
[03:41:30.480 --> 03:41:37.520]  they released a bio weapon and then they released a bio weapon shot which made people sicker
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:42.440]  and made people drop dead at every corner that's why we have defibrillators on the streets
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:47.000]  in Australia because so many people are dying and yet she wants to get up in front of the
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:52.200]  United Nations and say we are at war with people that would deny that we are telling
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:59.880]  the truth and everyone in that room got up and gave her a big round of applause her spewing
[03:41:59.880 --> 03:42:09.880]  lies about radicalization from online content you're the radical you're the radical who
[03:42:09.880 --> 03:42:16.960]  looks at people in the eye and tells them to go and get an injection that you know is
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:22.400]  going to kill millions you are the radical and we are well within our rights to call
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:33.480]  you out for it you're disgusting human being these people are insane and they're willingly
[03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:40.520]  insane and now we have this situation out of China and we have the timing of the treaty
[03:42:40.520 --> 03:42:47.600]  or the IHR amendments and I believe that it is all tying together and this is exactly
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:52.560]  why they want to shut us up more to come right on the other side of this break you don't want
[03:42:52.560 --> 03:43:03.200]  to miss this there's a war against our masculinity there's a war in the environment the food
[03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:08.680]  the water the air and the electromagnetics the injections to really cut us off from
[03:43:08.680 --> 03:43:16.040]  what God designed us to be but through mother nature the creator gave us compounds that
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:20.680]  can counteract what the globalists have done and I got to tell you all our supplements

[03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:13.480]  reading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones overwhelmed
[03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:20.720]  emergency wards queues outside crematoriums terrified people refusing to leave home is
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:26.800]  apparently what's happening in china right now and yet they've eased all their restrictions
[03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:31.480]  and they're opening their borders and China's open to the world again in January what is
[03:47:31.480 --> 03:47:36.800]  going on if the team can just get the footage out of China ready and just just play it on
[03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:42.840]  mute I'll talk people through what's actually going on over there I've got four clips for
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:47.680]  everyone to have a look so what we've seen is footage emerge out of China of these body
[03:47:47.680 --> 03:47:56.240]  bags that look extremely uniform I don't see the shape of a human body in these bags if
[03:47:56.240 --> 03:48:02.600]  they look honestly they look like they're filled with potatoes or sand or something again
[03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:06.760]  they just look extremely uniform but we're being told the bodies are just piling up
[03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:14.520]  with we've got this footage of body after body in crematoriums to the point where apparently
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:22.320]  Chinese people have to carry in their loved ones and line up outside of crematoriums
[03:48:22.320 --> 03:48:31.120]  and carry them themselves to the crematoriums because they're just dying on mass and the
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:37.440]  official story is that China's changed their covert death statistic reporting so that you
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:43.120]  actually have to you have to die exclusively from covert for them to call it a covert
[03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:48.520]  death which should be the case anyway might I add here it is this is people apparently
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:57.800]  wheeling their loved ones to the crematoriums where are they getting body bags and beds
[03:48:57.800 --> 03:49:03.920]  where are these people getting these body bags and these beds these gurneys to take
[03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:11.520]  their loved ones into the crematoriums how are they how do regular people get access
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:17.560]  to this many beds and body bags I mean the propaganda that's coming out of there is
[03:49:17.560 --> 03:49:26.840]  insane but there's a reason for it there is a reason for it we've got the WHA the sorry
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:33.640]  the the World Health Assembly working on these international health regulation amendments
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:37.600]  where they're erasing your human rights all of the above this actually this footage I'll
[03:49:37.600 --> 03:49:43.480]  pause here this footage is interesting because it says that she has released loosely translated
[03:49:43.480 --> 03:49:49.320]  she has released a new bioweapon of the CCP has released a new bioweapon this is apparently
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:54.560]  graffiti in China warning the world that a new bioweapon has been released so I want
[03:49:54.560 --> 03:50:00.040]  to talk about a couple of different things that may be happening here first of all this
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:04.480]  is the the mainstream media's propaganda around this as they're saying that there was something
[03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:11.000]  like 300 million cases one day last week and all these deaths but China's not reporting
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:16.080]  the deaths because they're not dying exclusively from COVID they're dying from other causes
[03:50:16.080 --> 03:50:22.480]  so they're not reporting them as COVID deaths well why all the body bags that is it a 5G
[03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:28.280]  attack is it something that's happening from the injections is it nothing at all is it
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:33.400]  just propaganda footage like we saw at the start you know do you remember people dropping
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:39.480]  dead on the streets I to this day have not seen one person from COVID drop dead on the
[03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:48.120]  streets I have seen people pass out and go into a fit from the injections but we don't
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:52.320]  know exactly what's going on what we do know is that China is saying that they're going
[03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:59.840]  to open their borders in on in January they're not reporting deaths the mainstream media
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:05.120]  is saying there are countless deaths this footage you know they say eyeballs can't
[03:51:05.120 --> 03:51:11.160]  be censored this is what they're saying also now you don't want to censor do you now you
[03:51:11.160 --> 03:51:17.480]  want information to get out there because you're telling us the truth all of a sudden
[03:51:17.480 --> 03:51:24.160]  lying scum herds of cures of herces can be seen stretching through civic centers yellow
[03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:29.160]  and red body bags are clearly stacked in the halls and outside the entrances of funeral
[03:51:29.160 --> 03:51:40.240]  homes so what is actually going on in China are people dropping on mass from the injections
[03:51:40.240 --> 03:51:46.680]  have they launched a 5g attack has the CCP created a new bioweapon as the graffiti told
[03:51:46.680 --> 03:51:53.880]  us over there or are they doing all of this exactly as they did at the start releasing
[03:51:53.880 --> 03:52:01.320]  all this propaganda out of China opening their borders in order to say that the virus or
[03:52:01.320 --> 03:52:07.560]  this you know deadly pandemic because the headlines actually say here in Australia the worst of
[03:52:07.560 --> 03:52:12.880]  the pandemic the worst nightmare that our worst fears all of the above are happening now as
[03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:20.800]  we speak in China I don't know how that happens you know lockdowns didn't work to contain the
[03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:29.320]  virus and nothing changed after you unlocked the world what happened was the injections are what
[03:52:29.320 --> 03:52:36.440]  actually caused are causing all of the issues but I want to talk about this this last point which
[03:52:36.440 --> 03:52:43.880]  is that the United States is requiring people to they're imposing imposing mandatory COVID
[03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:51.400]  testing for travellers from China right fair enough if the if the PCR test or the rat test is
[03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:56.440]  the gold standard and this is my point I was trying to make in telegram last night which by
[03:52:56.440 --> 03:53:02.480]  the way if you're not in my telegram jump in there Z media with three ease fantastic group of
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:10.160]  critically thinking individuals in there and around the around the clock news so Australia is
[03:53:10.160 --> 03:53:15.640]  resisting international moves to test Chinese tourists for COVID right it's saying that Alban
[03:53:15.640 --> 03:53:21.800]  easy our prime minister who was selected said that he would rely on medical advice which is to
[03:53:21.800 --> 03:53:28.480]  keep the borders open okay hang on a second let's dial back a minute you told us that the gold
[03:53:28.480 --> 03:53:35.960]  standard was lockdowns social distancing not travelling between states so on and so forth
[03:53:35.960 --> 03:53:43.880]  especially if you're unvaccinated and you told us that the PCR was the gold standard to make sure
[03:53:43.880 --> 03:53:49.160]  that we can identify tests but our prime minister is saying no no we're going to keep the borders
[03:53:49.160 --> 03:53:53.560]  open which is fine there's no problem keeping the borders open but all of a sudden the medical
[03:53:53.560 --> 03:53:58.760]  advice doesn't include your gold standard of testing that is apparently just the most reliable
[03:53:58.760 --> 03:54:04.560]  thing on the planet which can't tell the difference between the sniffle and you know
[03:54:04.560 --> 03:54:18.520]  respiratory virus and so why why is this happening now why is China opening up with this kind of
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:25.960]  a so-called outbreak why is the mainstream media reporting this outbreak why is the prime
[03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:32.320]  minister responding to this and saying even though the situation in China is so bad we're
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:37.360]  going to keep our borders open the situation may not even exist and I and I doubt that it does
[03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:42.160]  because this is the nature of propaganda and this is the nature of the globalist it's scare
[03:54:42.160 --> 03:54:49.400]  tactics my point is our prime minister is responding as though the situation exists the US is
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:55.960]  responding as though the situation exists they are responding as though the worst outbreak on the
[03:54:55.960 --> 03:55:01.520]  planet is happening in China right now and yet they are bringing in people from China to our
[03:55:01.520 --> 03:55:12.240]  countries why I'm not testing them with their gold standard test why well they need to get through
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:16.800]  the international health regulations amendments where they've erased your dignity human rights
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:24.800]  and fundamental freedoms they need your consent to get away with their treaty dr. Francis Boyle
[03:55:24.800 --> 03:55:30.360]  was just on here the other day warning about this I've warned about this Alex has warned about this
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:39.280]  the treaty is the most dangerous thing facing us to date this is a global medical takeover and I
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:45.520]  really really think and I've got this hunch so much so that I reported on it on Christmas Eve
[03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:52.640]  that something is happening with the China situation like we saw at the start you know
[03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:59.520]  pretending that China is hiding an outbreak the media getting on to finding them out investigating
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:06.160]  oh China's responsible because someone ate a bat remember that nonsense and then China's
[03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:10.600]  spreading it to the world and it's easy to pin it on China because they've demonised them so
[03:56:10.600 --> 03:56:19.920]  much in the media whether whether wrong or right a lot of the world easily blames China just like a
[03:56:19.920 --> 03:56:25.480]  lot of the world easily blames Putin meanwhile they're setting up all this infrastructure and
[03:56:25.480 --> 03:56:31.080]  if you saw Greg Reese's video if you haven't seen it yet please do go and watch it he includes an
[03:56:31.080 --> 03:56:38.320]  interview from me and a man Javi on smart cities that video is actually that interviews
[03:56:38.320 --> 03:56:44.600]  actually up on band up video the full interview on the Z media tab you can watch it this is the
[03:56:44.600 --> 03:56:48.840]  infrastructure that they're setting up your digital prison while all of this is going on and this
[03:56:48.840 --> 03:56:55.000]  situation and the amendments to the IHR are going to aid in setting up that digital prison
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:56:59.680]  because it calls for constant surveillance of citizens it calls for constant monitoring of
[03:56:59.680 --> 03:57:07.480]  citizens in order to be pandemic ready and maybe this time they'll say because we didn't have the
[03:57:07.480 --> 03:57:12.480]  system set up because we didn't have the treaty signed this is why China got away with it again I
[03:57:12.480 --> 03:57:19.320]  don't know exactly what's going to happen with the China situation but something is very very
[03:57:19.320 --> 03:57:25.120]  fishy there and that's why I'm talking about it and as much as I've tried to look away and say
[03:57:25.120 --> 03:57:31.600]  that's just propaganda something smells very very off I want to thank everyone for tuning in today
[03:57:31.600 --> 03:57:36.600]  thank you to the info wars team for all their hard work continue to support this broadcast in

[03:58:50.600 --> 03:58:56.200]  that made any republican victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the
[03:58:56.200 --> 03:59:02.880]  war machine possible the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates
[03:59:02.880 --> 03:59:08.800]  and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any
[03:59:08.800 --> 03:59:14.720]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive law
[03:59:14.720 --> 03:59:20.800]  fair being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info
