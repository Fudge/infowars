[00:00.000 --> 00:17.040]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:17.040 --> 00:33.360]  ladies and gentlemen Chris Cuomo has come out along with many others with a new talking boy
[00:33.360 --> 00:40.560]  they say that you never heard anyone say that they want to repeal the second amendment or even
[00:40.560 --> 00:49.200]  ban semi-autos it's a conspiracy theory made up by yours truly that's right this morning I saw a
[00:49.200 --> 00:55.920]  whole bunch of news articles that just mentioned jones is insanely claiming someone wants to repeal
[00:55.920 --> 01:04.560]  the second amendment and the NRA and Dana is saying and in all these other groups and organizations
[01:04.560 --> 01:13.280]  are just raising an alarm that is crying wolf but we have the former chief justice of the
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.240]  Supreme Court calling for it we have the different students at the marches as public figures calling
[01:18.240 --> 01:24.720]  for that right to be stripped from other americans to have our basic right to defense rate we have
[01:24.720 --> 01:28.400]  all these organizations that have introduced legislation to do it you've got areas like
[01:28.400 --> 01:35.360]  Chicago and DC where they had total gun bans until the supreme court ruled six years ago in dc
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.760]  versus heller that they had to allow some gun rights and they still basically haven't done it
[01:41.200 --> 01:48.880]  so you see a microcosm here of the incredible disdain that they have for everybody
[01:51.200 --> 01:54.640]  when they go there's no world government we're just having a world government summit
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.720]  announcing the world government and the world army and the world tax and by the way it's
[01:58.720 --> 02:04.400]  authoritarian and unelected they would deny there was an EU till the mid 90s and they officially
[02:04.400 --> 02:11.760]  launched it in 2000 remember that I remember being on talk radio in 96 and they were just
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.960]  then admitting the EU even was being set up because it was unelected people entered trade deals
[02:16.960 --> 02:24.480]  and suddenly they were told by the way the un is now in control of nato and the EU over you
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.560]  and there's an unelected bureaucracy that runs it but don't worry we're going to have elections
[02:28.560 --> 02:35.840]  to a parliament that's advisory and people go oh can i be on the advisory parliament with
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.200]  ceremonial elections to advise the permanent government that's how communist countries operate
[02:41.200 --> 02:51.440]  so that's how crazy this is and how they play these mind games but it doesn't work anymore and even
[02:51.440 --> 02:56.560]  the council on foreign relations and all their top publications admit the new world order globalism
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.560]  is dead on arrival their program will never be put back together again doesn't mean they didn't
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.640]  steal trillions doesn't mean the globalists aren't still big evil organizations doesn't mean they're
[03:04.640 --> 03:10.240]  not still swindling and taking control of things but their big world government push with that
[03:10.240 --> 03:16.000]  unelected system everywhere is being revolted against and of course it is once it's identified
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.160]  it's over now that said ladies and gentlemen when we return from break i'm going to roll
[03:24.160 --> 03:32.240]  through everything it is incredible the amount of news we've got here zuckerberg and microsoft not
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.520]  just facebook caught spying on all your private communications breaking into your phones i mean
[03:37.520 --> 03:44.880]  just controlling everything they really blew it with this analytical thing again that was the
[03:44.880 --> 03:51.040]  string on the sweater it's amazing that's all up on drubsreport.com we're going to be breaking
[03:51.040 --> 03:57.840]  that down tomorrow's news today i told you back on march 7th and march 8th and 9th uh that kim
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.240]  jong-un had already agreed to trump's terms ahead of meeting and now north korea and china have
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.880]  announced the terms are already agreed to and were agreed to back in that early march meeting that
[04:06.880 --> 04:13.360]  we told you about tomorrow's news today next week's news today that's why they hate us and want us
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.360]  banned because we have the real sources and we get the real information out to you madis has come out
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.600]  in the press conference and bragged about killing russians in syria which is just a really terrible
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.560]  thing and i'm not trying to attack madis but this is bad as this whole cold war goes into a hot war
[04:28.560 --> 04:35.760]  with russia trump says they will never repeal the second amendment but meanwhile the left is calling
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.560]  for enforcers to be banned again saying we're not allowed to criticize the public figures the high
[04:40.560 --> 04:45.600]  school seniors like david hogg that says we're shaking in our boots and who challenges us to
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.480]  debates but then won't do it he can call me a piece of you know what you name it i've got to treat him
[04:50.480 --> 04:57.680]  like he is the pope's god i mean it like like he's the king of the universe he's just the master of
[04:57.680 --> 05:07.840]  everything waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[05:07.840 --> 05:22.560]  info war all right folks i've been on the phone all morning with my lawyers didn't get to work out
[05:22.560 --> 05:29.120]  this morning or play with my baby daughter as long as i'd like to because i spent three hours
[05:29.120 --> 05:34.720]  dealing with it and i can't announce it yet but there's been another dastardly illegal fraudulent
[05:34.720 --> 05:40.320]  attempt to take down our youtube channel with billions of views so it is just ongoing live
[05:40.320 --> 05:46.320]  time as we speak and we're had to have to file injunctions a bunch of other stuff but the war
[05:46.320 --> 05:55.760]  for the first amendment is on right now ladies and gentlemen and it is intense
[05:56.240 --> 05:57.760]  i've got an announcement to make here
[06:01.120 --> 06:07.520]  i am endorsing david hogg i am endorsing the march for our lives i am endorsing
[06:07.520 --> 06:16.800]  george soros i am endorsing michael bloomberg i am endorsing michael moore i am endorsing the
[06:19.360 --> 06:25.840]  former supreme court justice john pole stevens when they came out and said repeal the second
[06:25.840 --> 06:33.200]  amendment and you've got them saying give us an inch we'll take it a mile mr and mrs america turn
[06:33.200 --> 06:38.320]  them all in we want all guns banned except for single shot black powder that's what john stevens
[06:38.320 --> 06:45.600]  is publicly proposing and that is what the same globalists have done in every other nation but
[06:46.320 --> 06:52.800]  the united states and switzerland they had everything we had 20 years ago in australia
[06:52.800 --> 06:59.920]  they're down to single shots with special licenses and the real crocodile dundee in the mid-1990s
[06:59.920 --> 07:05.920]  this was only in the nra magazine and i checked it in newspapers in australia the real crocodile
[07:05.920 --> 07:13.600]  dundee looked just like the guy really wrestled uh crocodiles you know made steve urwin look like
[07:13.600 --> 07:19.360]  a wimp and urwin was an amazing talented guy as well got rested so you know great guy
[07:21.600 --> 07:28.080]  he was way out in the bush in his full farmhouse and they came and killed him
[07:28.080 --> 07:34.320]  he killed three of the federal police as well but he died in a shootout with them taking his guns
[07:35.360 --> 07:40.960]  so when they say they're coming for our guns folks they mean it and it is our american ethos
[07:40.960 --> 07:44.560]  and so paul washington's doing a video i was talking to him this morning saying listen
[07:45.440 --> 07:51.200]  you got to do a judo move here uh trumps poll numbers are up five to ten points even in the
[07:51.200 --> 07:58.800]  fake polls that over sample democrats 15 points on average uh all republican poll numbers are up
[07:59.360 --> 08:04.560]  in in in battleground uh states and purple states suddenly they've gained five to ten
[08:04.560 --> 08:12.400]  some cases 20 points the blue wave of soros money in hysteria had a chance of taking the house of
[08:12.400 --> 08:23.360]  representatives but right now ladies and gentlemen right now they have wounded that
[08:23.360 --> 08:30.080]  by their arrogance and i was told off record by a very interesting prominent pro-gun person
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.000]  who said some of it on record i think i'm gonna air the ted newton extended interview tomorrow
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.200]  we play the excerpts but i think i'm gonna air it tomorrow it's an hour and a half long it's amazing
[08:37.200 --> 08:43.600]  at his house north of austin at his ranch with his great wife dogs and family and
[08:45.680 --> 08:48.400]  he let me in on inside baseball that i'd also been told that
[08:50.720 --> 08:55.920]  he said some of them i'm gonna get into it all but 100 percent trump goes oh let's legalize
[08:55.920 --> 09:00.960]  all these people and the democrats go no you're a racist we must have totally open borders and one
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.480]  person can have 20 people deep come in no vetting and if felons can stay and then nothing happens on
[09:06.480 --> 09:12.480]  DACA and that that's what trump is doing going oh yeah take the guns you're right sure you're
[09:12.480 --> 09:20.320]  winning and then they run out go we're taking up we're winning it's over and i just rhetorically
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.040]  i don't like doing that tactic but that is what trumps doing everybody needs to know that
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.960]  and it is 40 chess and i had a discussion with paul
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.760]  and and he's right i endorse david hog
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.760]  i don't think he's following gun talking points i think it's totally real i think every student
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.560]  at that school is anti-gun and i'm glad seeing in his band all those students that wanted to come
[09:48.560 --> 09:54.880]  on that were pro-gun uh and i just think hog is a hero and i think it's good to say that we're
[09:54.880 --> 10:00.480]  shaking in our boots wanting to be disarmed and live like folks do in chicago uh and and when he
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.120]  says everyone's shaking and it makes a little evil face that no one's allowed to criticize him
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.080]  when he's up there in front of a jumbo tron on every tv station in america that that you do not
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.240]  ever question him and i agree with hog and his supporters that have called for me being banned
[10:14.240 --> 10:20.960]  off youtube you know what they're right this is a 21st century book burning but see i also want
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.600]  to get it straight in my head that komo's right you know the governor's a little little brother
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.720]  who gets to do hit and runs in front of everybody and run over people's cars and stuff in in front
[10:32.720 --> 10:37.520]  of people at a town fair fall out drunk last year and then not get in trouble that's on record
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.680]  he's allowed to hit and run drunk driving he's allowed to read wiki leaks too he said i can
[10:41.680 --> 10:46.720]  read wiki leaks but if you do you're going to be arrested by the way a son's had his internet cut
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.840]  off just 30 minutes ago so they're saying they may swat team him at any time we'll see we'll follow
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.720]  that pray for his union son's a real hero members of the british parliament are calling him a
[10:56.720 --> 11:03.440]  sniveling worm today which is a tip off they're getting ready to move on him but komo he says no
[11:03.440 --> 11:07.920]  one is calling for the repeal of the second amendment it's a boogeyman so you've got the
[11:07.920 --> 11:11.360]  new york times front page you've got the former supreme court judges you had all these other
[11:11.360 --> 11:18.560]  liberals democrats globalists everywhere they're in control they end up taking all the guns
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.560]  but komo says it doesn't exist and that's the new talking point by democratic strategist is
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.960]  stop saying that of course we're going to ban all semi auto which is 90 plus percent of firearms
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.360]  that's what i keep saying it's just this bush master it's just this one rifle and then magically
[11:37.360 --> 11:41.760]  the shooters always use that one and they always go to a victim's fireman zone and always a blue
[11:41.760 --> 11:47.120]  city always a blue state always a blue county there's always a stand down
[11:47.120 --> 11:57.360]  you know so-called assault rifles of that type are using less than two percent of the crime
[11:57.360 --> 12:02.800]  but magically they're used in all school shootings all real mass shootings
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.760]  may have a gangbanger shoot a couple other gangbangers with a handgun but all the big ones
[12:07.760 --> 12:13.840]  all the big productions and when i say productions the media hypes is where you go kill people
[12:13.840 --> 12:17.200]  they hype it's it's like an option for somebody that wants to commit suicide
[12:17.200 --> 12:21.520]  just like they used to know when somebody jumped off the empire states building and it got on the
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.280]  news you'd have five more people the next day do it until you had to station police up there
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.280]  and plexiglass it off because oh somebody just jumped off the empire states building let me do it
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.680]  well other loons go well the number one thing in our news and our culture school shootings
[12:34.320 --> 12:38.720]  and so let me see i'll just go to a blue state area i'll be on all these drugs they'll know i'm
[12:38.720 --> 12:44.400]  coming to kill people they'll stand down as usual 20 plus times beforehand and then when
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.000]  he goes in to shoot people they stand out again and then gun owners get blamed for it
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.360]  so komo says nobody's trying to take your guns they've just taken them everywhere else
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.840]  this is the level of mind control they think you're under aren't you as democrats insulted
[13:03.840 --> 13:09.760]  by komo talking to you like this but see they got to get their people mobilized to take the guns
[13:09.760 --> 13:13.920]  but at the same time they want to tell you so you hesitate to military tactic in world war one
[13:13.920 --> 13:19.520]  they started doing it the germans did the austrian garyans did they went through loudspeakers
[13:19.520 --> 13:25.520]  in english and in french we and russian we are not attacking this is not an assault your commanders
[13:25.520 --> 13:31.840]  have laid down their arms surrender we have food we have medicine as the the shells are falling
[13:31.840 --> 13:38.400]  and and and a small percentage of the people in the bunkers and at the guns would go you see
[13:38.400 --> 13:42.320]  they are friends they want to be nice i'm your friend i help me and you get shot
[13:44.480 --> 13:47.920]  and so komo's like no one wants your guns there is no world government no one's coming for your
[13:47.920 --> 13:54.080]  kids liberals love you take your prozac everything's fine drink your fluoride liberalism's good world
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.800]  government's good never mind all the big billionaires that are tax exempt listen to zuckerberg listen
[13:58.800 --> 14:02.960]  to zuckerberg listen to bezos listen to bill gates listen to warren buffett they love you
[14:02.960 --> 14:06.960]  they know how to take care of you they love you we have cough in apartments ready for you that
[14:06.960 --> 14:10.960]  costs more than regular apartments lower your standard of living it's cool it's cool to be a
[14:10.960 --> 14:18.560]  slave excuse me huh i'm a raving and mafia scumbag just lay down to me so when you come back from
[14:18.560 --> 14:25.520]  break komo says it doesn't exist and then i'm going to play them saying they want to confiscate our
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.640]  guns and all the signs and the rest of it and just what's in the news now google suddenly today
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.480]  started blocking searches for banned gun signs and videos so google's working around the clock
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.680]  that's admitted in the news to i've got the articles to block info wars and others just
[14:41.680 --> 14:48.080]  like they block our videos from searches and ban them showing other young people at the school
[14:48.080 --> 14:53.280]  saying they stood down they stood down we don't want to turn our guns in those videos were banned
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.400]  and now them saying they want to take your guns
[15:04.960 --> 15:11.360]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[15:15.520 --> 15:19.920]  so john paul stevens comes out three days ago and says repeal the second amendment
[15:19.920 --> 15:26.400]  ban it down to nothing but black powder single shot with a license pretty much what australia has
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.960]  done in every other country the globalist got control of in every city they have control of
[15:30.960 --> 15:36.560]  total gun bans an incredible crime and government mafia ruling over everyone and we've got the
[15:36.560 --> 15:41.680]  marchers and the main students saying give us an inch we'll take it a mile the signs saying we're
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.960]  going to ban the guns diane feinstein saying if i could ban all the semi-autos mr and mr america
[15:46.960 --> 15:54.320]  turn them all in we know the goal of the un in the treaty obama signed and the accompanying
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.440]  codices of how it's carried out because the un always has these treaties open ended
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.200]  just like obama care was open ended to do whatever they want it said civilian ownership of firearms
[16:05.200 --> 16:10.160]  threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state and so needs to be abolished
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.680]  for the good of the tranquility and peace of the world go read it for yourself
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.920]  that's a pretty much an exact quote i think i'm paraphrasing the end of it my memory is
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.800]  not completely photographic as it once was but here we are qualmo and this is so fundamental
[16:28.800 --> 16:36.640]  and other ones are running around now like chickens who took a large dose of methamphetamine pcp lsd
[16:36.640 --> 16:43.840]  and then had their heads chopped off saying no one wants your guns no no no so so they're they're
[16:43.840 --> 16:52.000]  back to the old we don't want your guns we're your friends we we care about you uh there's no
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.880]  world government there's nothing going on no one's spying on you no one's surveilling you
[16:56.880 --> 17:01.440]  don't listen to alex jones saying kim jung already agreed to trump's terms back in early march which
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.440]  is now completely confirmed today and jones has incredible sources we can't let you know he has
[17:05.440 --> 17:13.920]  those he's fake news oh yeah that's coming up as well so here's qualmo talking to cnn viewers like
[17:14.640 --> 17:20.080]  they are the biggest morons on the planet but if you go out and i've got hours of raw video shot
[17:20.080 --> 17:26.080]  by millie we were at onshore and others at different rallies uh around the country and
[17:26.080 --> 17:31.600]  but just the ones last weekend and i shot there last night as my wife went to bed there were
[17:31.600 --> 17:37.280]  thunderstorms i woke up at about midnight so i got up went and ate some cereal and i'm sitting
[17:37.280 --> 17:42.640]  there in the kitchen and i'm watching these videos and i mean they'll go 10 minutes and nobody even
[17:42.640 --> 17:50.400]  chants or talk then they'll go we vote turn in the guns we vote we have the power and and then no
[17:50.400 --> 17:59.760]  one talks for like 10 minutes and then you you you you you you you see people and no one can even
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.720]  talk and then they'll have a minder come over and say don't talk to them even if we don't have an
[18:04.720 --> 18:12.400]  info wars microphone a flag it says action seven whatever they don't care and you realize oh my
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.640]  god even when other leftists try to talk to each other another one will walk over and say don't
[18:16.640 --> 18:23.200]  talk to them these are like zombie followers and they all have like slump shoulders and little
[18:23.200 --> 18:28.800]  chicken arms and like big turkey goblet things hanging off their necks black white old young
[18:28.800 --> 18:34.400]  hispanic and you look at these people's eyes it looks like their souls were sucked it's the
[18:34.400 --> 18:40.720]  opposite of not having light there's not even a deadness it's like there's nothing there they're
[18:40.720 --> 18:52.320]  just empty and that's what's going on the left is culturally spiritually like soul sucked followers
[18:52.320 --> 19:00.640]  and then you realize they are true evil I mean their crowds are ugly stupid
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.160]  and then you've got to got to got the upper caste controller ones that are always
[19:08.160 --> 19:15.120]  smiling with pleasure and kind of grooming little stables of minions and everyone comes over and
[19:15.120 --> 19:20.640]  the men all look beyond effeminate when you look at they all are like standing there purcing their
[19:20.640 --> 19:26.560]  lips going listening to whatever said and just stand with always the little arms wobbling around
[19:26.560 --> 19:33.040]  looking like little bizarre overfed chickens or something I mean it's like thank god we're not
[19:33.040 --> 19:39.120]  these people and then you get hog and you know the art class and the and the and the acting class
[19:39.120 --> 19:45.200]  who were at the real shooting real event but who are the spokespersons from the acting drama club
[19:45.200 --> 19:49.920]  to go out their little hollywood outfits and stuff like they're trying to do a casting call for the
[19:49.920 --> 19:58.560]  you know third season of stranger things and it's a big production kind of like when I saw Hillary
[19:58.560 --> 20:07.200]  Clinton at her town hall a couple years ago and I said that shot in super HD those are all actors
[20:07.200 --> 20:13.680]  that's a fake town hall WikiLeaks came out that was a fake town hall we know when it's a movie folks
[20:13.680 --> 20:19.760]  you can look at a documentary and tell when it's real you can just look at it you know
[20:19.760 --> 20:25.360]  you know when something's fake and so what I'm saying is it's synthetic it's astroturf and they
[20:25.360 --> 20:29.760]  say that's the big crime it's all over the news that they want to shut info wars down they want
[20:29.760 --> 20:35.600]  to sood some more they want us off youtube because I made comparisons to the youth marches to mouse
[20:35.600 --> 20:41.280]  satung and hitler which is totally comparable they're even wearing armbands and they're funded
[20:41.280 --> 20:47.440]  by nazi collaborator george soros and they want our free speech I mean wow that's stories on info
[20:47.440 --> 20:52.560]  wars.com but since I mentioned it here's komo here's komo saying nobody is going to repeal the
[20:52.560 --> 20:56.160]  second amendment here it is brother and you got the president of the united states this morning
[20:56.160 --> 21:01.440]  tweeting that the second amendment will never be repealed we must have more who's calling for repeal
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.600]  the second amendment well who's calling for it just as stevens did but that's not it was in the
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.920]  context of a conversation about the fastest route to legal change and of course if you hadn't
[21:09.920 --> 21:16.960]  done it he did not go read it headline repeal the second amendment he did not
[21:19.040 --> 21:23.520]  talk about a mind game let's continue didn't have a second amendment you wouldn't have heller it
[21:23.520 --> 21:28.000]  would be easier to change the laws he's not a politician he's not in office he's not the head
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.640]  of any kind of significant group oh he's just the former supreme court justice i'd shut it down
[21:32.640 --> 21:38.240]  let's go out to break with this clip i can't get to it all but uh this is the dims and they're
[21:38.240 --> 21:43.520]  coming after your guns and when we return all the times they called us hitler but now if you
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.920]  compare this march to hitlerian operations well then you need to be banned off the internet
[21:47.920 --> 21:55.280]  which is hitlerian here it is if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states
[21:55.280 --> 22:03.520]  for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have
[22:03.520 --> 22:09.680]  done it when they give us that inch that bump stock ban we will take a mile you've heard people say
[22:09.680 --> 22:20.000]  you'll have to pry my gun for my cold day okay we have introduced an assault weapons
[22:20.000 --> 22:27.040]  ban i'm talking about a ban on assault rifles if you listen real close you can hear the people
[22:27.040 --> 22:32.560]  in power shaking it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every
[22:32.560 --> 22:37.760]  monday we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[22:37.760 --> 22:46.560]  about guns in a vastly different way enough enough enough we say no more even the presentation during
[22:46.560 --> 22:53.120]  the march for life rally in washington dc subjected the participants with no thy enemies style
[22:53.120 --> 22:58.160]  exposition where took the guns stolen took the guns if you try to take our firearms doesn't
[22:58.160 --> 23:02.560]  matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken we
[23:02.560 --> 23:10.960]  will not relinquish them a great example of how the average liberal sjw is so stupid and uneducated
[23:10.960 --> 23:16.000]  on the matters of gun control enough is enough enough not one of them can tell me what they're
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.320]  marching for do you think the imperials would want to take the guns and star wars i'm gonna talk to you
[23:20.320 --> 23:28.640]  i hate it this is amazing this is amazing jones is a conspiracy theorist he says that we want your
[23:28.640 --> 23:34.480]  guns which we do but you're still insane if you say we do i'm quoting from the legislation right
[23:34.480 --> 23:41.040]  here the georgia bureau of investigations shall seize and take possession possession of any assault
[23:41.040 --> 23:51.360]  weapon large capacity magazine armor pierce stay weathered ladies and gentlemen big brother
[23:52.720 --> 24:04.240]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he live from austin texas
[24:04.240 --> 24:14.400]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones well the greedy democrats really took the bait didn't they
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.240]  trump began to signal that uh he was for reasonable gun restrictions but we all know they really
[24:20.240 --> 24:24.000]  just want to repeal the second amendment as they've done in countries across the world taking
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.040]  the right to keep their arms away that's the great goal of tyrants throughout history and so the
[24:29.040 --> 24:34.480]  democrats then got arrogant they had their big marches uh the department of education basically
[24:36.080 --> 24:41.680]  took the streets in all 50 states hauling with them the few children they have that's why less
[24:41.680 --> 24:45.760]  than 10 percent were actually below the age of 18 and they announced that they won an end of the
[24:45.760 --> 24:51.040]  first amendment they announced they want info wars banned they announced they want trump dead
[24:51.040 --> 24:55.440]  they announced they want gun owners dead they announced that we're shaking in our boots they
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.280]  announced that we're scared to debate them when it's actually they that are scared to debate us
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.600]  it is incredible and it blew up in their little authoritarian faces it blew up in their limning
[25:07.600 --> 25:15.200]  faces and now poll numbers have trump and republicans five to 15 to 20 points ahead and that's even
[25:15.200 --> 25:21.920]  with skewed CNN polls where they sample 25 percent or 20 percent depending on the poll
[25:21.920 --> 25:27.520]  more democrats than republicans trump is well above 40 percent so you know that's 60 percent
[25:28.320 --> 25:34.880]  and it's the same thing in gallup and others where you know he was 45 now he's 55 it's amazing
[25:34.880 --> 25:42.080]  to see this blow up in their face in hundreds of different polls that are different variants
[25:42.080 --> 25:49.120]  and different breakdowns of the same disinformation because you see even with fake polls they can't
[25:49.120 --> 25:56.160]  just keep lowering and lowering and lowering it because there's only so many numbers they can lower
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.560]  people won't buy into it anymore and so their main thing is the oversampling of democrats
[26:00.560 --> 26:04.320]  but when trump goes up and up and up they still have to show that it's going up and up and up
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.880]  they try to have it down there at 35 40 percent to create the illusion that you're losing and
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.200]  that you know we're going to collapse that it's all over as they try to demoralize us but it's not
[26:13.200 --> 26:22.160]  working so i've said david hogg with that evil little snickering face they're scared of us
[26:22.160 --> 26:27.520]  they're shaking in their boots and folks up are saying we're going to get your guns that has now
[26:28.160 --> 26:34.480]  blown up spectacularly and here's the thing we have a right to defend ourselves
[26:34.480 --> 26:44.560]  we have a right as citizens that's what this country's founded on it's our ethos
[26:46.480 --> 26:54.880]  and you can't then have holier than now students because they survived a government stand down
[26:54.880 --> 27:01.120]  and another prozac had thank god they did then project on to us that we victimize them and we're
[27:01.120 --> 27:06.400]  guilty we shouldn't just not put up with that we should be angry when a nazi collaborator
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.720]  george soros the democratic party go and organize that and then armed men and the national guard
[27:12.720 --> 27:19.520]  protect their free speech which i'm all for while david hogg supporters and cnn and think
[27:19.520 --> 27:24.160]  progress and the daily mail and all of them come out and say why is him for war still up
[27:25.200 --> 27:30.480]  he already said none of the kids died and lied about david hogg and tried to bully him and tried
[27:30.480 --> 27:35.280]  to debate him and i'm reading this stuff in all these newspapers last night today none of it's true
[27:36.640 --> 27:40.880]  everybody knows it's david hogg calling me names everybody knows it's him saying let's debate and
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.000]  then not doing it everybody knows they took down our youtube videos of other students saying that
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.080]  there was a stand down which we now know that's why they took our videos down
[27:52.960 --> 27:56.400]  but see we had a platform to sit here and actually play the videos and so youtube had to put them
[27:56.400 --> 28:03.280]  back up and now they're just in a tizzy i got a stack of news here saying we want alex jones band
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.480]  and we want him banned right now and we've got don lemon cnn admits to using students as human
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.920]  shields they say you should not be allowed to criticize these victims and these survivors
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.800]  so isn't that perfect you've got people who are selectively picked because they're anti gun and
[28:18.800 --> 28:25.040]  their parents are anti gun they're foisted out at high tech promotion they go all over the country
[28:25.040 --> 28:30.400]  on private jets they bust in all these people and then i'm not supposed to be able to say
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.120]  wow they're calling to take our free speech they're calling to take our guns they're calling to take
[28:35.120 --> 28:45.760]  so many of our rights this is dangerous and then they had all the headlines
[28:48.720 --> 28:53.680]  they say jones must be shut down here it is outrage is right wing websites compare
[28:53.680 --> 28:58.880]  parkland shooting survivor david hog to hitler after sick videos emerge of his march for our
[28:58.880 --> 29:05.600]  live speech dubbed with the nazi leader's voice though it compares nazi youth rallies to this
[29:05.600 --> 29:10.960]  being funded by a nazi collaborator there isn't a jury in the world that would in a defamation
[29:10.960 --> 29:17.840]  case say you can fairly make those comparisons plus they're all public figures and then it goes in
[29:17.840 --> 29:21.840]  the far right conspiracy there is alex jones played one of the videos on info wars on tuesday
[29:21.840 --> 29:27.200]  saying it was truly frightening and what i said is i don't think he's a nazi i don't think
[29:27.200 --> 29:32.880]  you know he's wearing arm bands and going with fascist iconography david hog but i said you
[29:32.880 --> 29:37.920]  can't lie about the parallels of authoritarianism and youth marches from the communist in china to
[29:37.920 --> 29:43.920]  hitler and germany that that's what they do and they use youth movements to take over here's another
[29:43.920 --> 29:49.840]  one youtube's warnings didn't deter alex jones from attacking parkland survivors think progress
[29:49.840 --> 29:54.720]  and another yellow journalism fraud lies and says i said nobody died that they were actors
[29:54.720 --> 29:59.520]  crisis actors lies and says all the regular stuff and then says jones needs to be taken off
[30:01.200 --> 30:07.440]  for targeting and harassing students and saying they're nazis well you know what i didn't say
[30:07.440 --> 30:12.560]  they were nazis i said you can clearly see the parallels of youth movements and all the rest of
[30:12.560 --> 30:19.440]  it and the left does use racial identification to control people so that's race-based look at the
[30:19.440 --> 30:26.320]  democratic party but let's play a clip just darin mcbrain put this together in 30 minutes this morning
[30:26.320 --> 30:30.880]  you could have 10 hours of this everybody knows that you they say if you make an okay sign
[30:32.720 --> 30:35.200]  like the black guy would make on the sprite commercials when i was a kid
[30:36.000 --> 30:43.520]  this he's a racist too okay means hey this is how how's that food oh chef like that if you kiss
[30:43.520 --> 30:49.200]  the fingers that's universal like oh mom just i mean in italy and france everywhere that's
[30:50.720 --> 30:56.560]  boy not but the hand goes up like this is incredible that it doesn't matter they want to
[30:56.560 --> 31:02.880]  take every symbol and say it's racist and trumps hitler and they played hitler behind him bill
[31:02.880 --> 31:08.720]  mar did it but that's okay but when i do it it's bullying and i need to be banned which is hitlerian
[31:08.720 --> 31:14.640]  let me say who's like hitler the daily mail think progress the democrats all these publications
[31:14.640 --> 31:22.640]  saying shut me down let's go to part of these clips we'll vote on or before the 12th for
[31:23.440 --> 31:32.240]  donald j trump for president thank you that was saturday at a rally in florida
[31:32.240 --> 31:37.920]  trump was asking supporters to raise their hands vowing to vote for him in the march 15th primary
[31:37.920 --> 31:42.480]  but that led to headlines like these where some compared that moment to something that might have
[31:42.480 --> 31:48.320]  happened at a rally in nazi germany we all look at adolf hitler in 1940 we should look at adolf
[31:48.320 --> 31:53.760]  hitler in 1929 he was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were
[31:53.760 --> 32:00.640]  thinking where donald trump takes it i have absolutely no idea but donald trump is a dangerous
[32:00.640 --> 32:06.240]  man with the things that he has been saying so i had one of hitler's speeches translated into english
[32:06.240 --> 32:12.400]  and i think this tells us a lot about where donald trump is getting his ideas look at this hitler
[32:12.400 --> 32:18.160]  speech and we've translated it for you thank you thank you we're gonna make germany great again
[32:19.760 --> 32:27.360]  that i can tell you believe me so when people ask why you support donald trump you just tell them
[32:27.360 --> 32:35.200]  he's going to take our economy from here to here my understanding is you want to clear the air
[32:35.200 --> 32:41.200]  because you think you're being unfavorably compared to donald trump don't get me wrong conan i agree
[32:41.200 --> 32:49.120]  with a lot he says a lot like 90 of what he says i'm like this guy gets it but it's just
[32:50.640 --> 32:57.920]  i don't like the way he says it it's just it's crass yeah yeah trump is very very crass yeah
[32:57.920 --> 33:02.960]  so imagine if i dress up in a hitler outfit and then i come on my own show and get interviewed
[33:02.960 --> 33:11.440]  say by david night and i say that i'm hitler and i endorse david hog and i endorse towards soros
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.000]  they would have complete heart attacks you know i think i may actually do that because that's the
[33:16.000 --> 33:22.000]  sick evil left where they think they've got free speech and they've got satire but no one else does
[33:22.000 --> 33:27.920]  they're a bunch of bullies and they are like hitler they are the threat they are the enemy
[33:27.920 --> 33:39.760]  and they want our guns so they can kick our eyeballs in
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.600]  you want to stop tyranny our defense free speech
[33:47.600 --> 33:57.440]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[34:00.560 --> 34:07.200]  i gotta tell you trump really suckered him again and i was told this but i still the audience gets
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.240]  mad i get mad i'm just such a straight shooter that i don't play mackey of ellie in games i can
[34:12.240 --> 34:18.080]  get him i can study him but then with trump i don't really have my radar going for that
[34:18.640 --> 34:22.960]  and uh he really suckered the dims and to admit they want to repeal the second amendment
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.960]  remember feinstein about a month ago like rubbing your hands together like a witch can we pull that
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.920]  up and he's like listen put it on the table whatever you want hey it's on the table let's do it
[34:31.920 --> 34:37.040]  may not pass but whatever you want on the table sure and i got that he was neutralizing him i
[34:37.040 --> 34:41.360]  talked to ted newton a few days later talked to some congressman about my conversation with
[34:41.360 --> 34:47.440]  ted newton confirmed what went on in meetings and uh the dims are so delusional they didn't know
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.840]  they were sitting right next to him in that meeting when she was rubbing her hands together like a
[34:51.840 --> 34:58.000]  giant rat that he was baiting them to come out and say what they really wanted and now
[34:59.120 --> 35:05.760]  the republicans have gained on average 15 points this is unbelievable that they came out but listen
[35:05.760 --> 35:09.360]  they're stealing elections everywhere they're throwing more money than ever at these special
[35:09.360 --> 35:15.120]  elections and we are in the fight of our lives so i don't want to be too confident here but
[35:15.120 --> 35:20.880]  i was talking to paul watson last night today i agree with him all the intel checks out i just
[35:20.880 --> 35:28.640]  don't know if i like trump intellectually and culturally and politically going along with them
[35:28.640 --> 35:36.080]  on the surface to sucker them in what was the clip it was about a month ago it was a press conference
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.720]  or it was one of those deals around the big brown table at the white house in the west wing
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.120]  and feinstein sitting next to him yeah there it is there she's rubbing her hands together
[35:45.840 --> 35:50.560]  back that up i want to play that from about a minute ago here a minute because these people
[35:50.560 --> 35:55.680]  just do not even get it that's how delusional they are but when but what you get with trump is
[35:55.680 --> 36:01.200]  something different now the budget started denting my confidence because i know it's not a budget the
[36:01.200 --> 36:08.480]  omnibus but it's 12 spending bills a year the an omnibus is combining one or two or more and
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.280]  i don't like what's in there but he was given it by congress he says it's horrible he says they did it
[36:13.280 --> 36:17.280]  he's going to hold up all the spending and have a government shutdown and they get the blame for
[36:17.280 --> 36:23.760]  that he understands how precarious our economy is it was the lesser of two evil choices because
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.640]  he's not a dictator and he doesn't need to be a dictator but the point is he doesn't have total
[36:28.640 --> 36:38.000]  control so my gut is i have confidence in trump but he doesn't have total control now the russia
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.440]  thing i'm going to get to that a little bit more next hour madis gave a press conference bragging
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.920]  about bombing those russians a few months ago calling them mercenaries saying they're lucky we
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.480]  don't kill more when they went in there and cleaned out isis and al-qaeda that obama put in charge
[36:50.480 --> 36:59.280]  shame on the lighthouse going down this road to try to dent mewler mewler's full of crap excuse
[36:59.280 --> 37:04.800]  me uh it's family show i'm serious though so this is getting dangerous folks and china's the threat
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.840]  they got a 40 ship task force threatening our ships claiming control the south china sea
[37:10.480 --> 37:18.080]  that's what japan started world war two with that type of stuff so china is in control of our
[37:18.080 --> 37:25.200]  telecommunications control grid that controls all the numbers ems everything i told you about that
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.000]  years ago it's finally in the news only because we have trump in there that's the problem if the
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.640]  russians were in control of our telecom switching keys i'd be going crazy
[37:37.680 --> 37:45.360]  apple has given their code keys last month to communist china writers i had top experts on
[37:45.360 --> 37:51.280]  they said yes it's the keys to the kingdom you know the movie elysium when they get the root
[37:51.280 --> 37:58.080]  key for the space station he goes he's got the keys to the kingdom that's what it is this is insane
[38:01.280 --> 38:06.720]  because there was a global alliance made in the 70s and 80s with the globalist between china to
[38:06.720 --> 38:11.920]  give them the Panama canal to give them everything to give them control the deepwater ports to give
[38:11.920 --> 38:19.760]  them access to our telecoms everything and you know one of the crew was making a great point
[38:19.760 --> 38:25.040]  harrison and i saw this in the news at the time i didn't think to make a point our rockets
[38:25.040 --> 38:33.920]  come back down and land the boosters you know in envisioned by yule's verne 130 years ago now it's
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.880]  real they launched their rockets can't even do it from the ocean they don't even launch it out
[38:38.880 --> 38:42.640]  towards the ocean with a trajectory so people are safe they just shoot them straight up and then the
[38:42.640 --> 38:49.040]  big boosters fall on people's houses killing people and the government just goes they're just
[38:49.040 --> 38:56.560]  people that's communist for you children eating dead dogs in the streets in venezuela china with
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.080]  lakes that catch on fire rivers that catch on fire rocket boosters that just fall on their cities
[39:02.080 --> 39:11.440]  can you imagine if nasa shot rockets up at a trajectory where it fall on top say chicago or la
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.240]  that's the difference the west values line and i'm sick of china being defended it is the most
[39:18.240 --> 39:26.400]  bloodthirsty murderous out of control group china you walk one block out of a rich area
[39:26.400 --> 39:31.440]  and there are dead bodies on the south street there are no dogs or birds hopping around because
[39:31.440 --> 39:40.160]  everybody eats them and all over the media china is the answer china is great china is this china
[39:40.160 --> 39:48.240]  china china china china china our rockets come back down and land vertically like something out
[39:48.240 --> 39:54.000]  of science fiction theirs just rain down on their people they could go out to an island and do it
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.840]  they could go and aim it at a trajectory but see it gets better boost if it goes straight up
[39:57.840 --> 40:04.240]  so that's why we have it at cake carnival that's why we launch our rockets over the ocean and then
[40:04.240 --> 40:09.840]  we clear the ocean out so in case it does fall it doesn't kill anybody and now we have rocket boosters
[40:09.840 --> 40:16.320]  that come back down and land on the ships and see how innovation makes everything we do better
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.800]  that's not how the chai karm operates let's have a heavy booster that the u.s. government gave them
[40:22.800 --> 40:28.560]  under bill clinton take off with icbm technology and then just had big old giant booster pieces
[40:28.560 --> 40:36.080]  come crashing down killing people bernie sanders i want a vacation in china and i had my honeymoon

[45:20.240 --> 45:24.160]  shane con should speak out against sexual mutilization and he acted like someone was threatening
[45:24.160 --> 45:30.320]  to mutilate him she got her twitter banned show a woman speaking out against women being put into
[45:30.320 --> 45:38.320]  sex slavery and their genitals being cut off their clitoris is being cut off and she's banned
[45:39.840 --> 45:45.600]  and facebook and twitter and google work with pakistan and others to help report on blasphemers
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.520]  that are either christian or don't believe in god and atheists get arrested and executed this is in
[45:51.520 --> 45:57.840]  the news and the left loves it they're in love with islam and the men enslaving the women and
[45:57.840 --> 46:03.200]  the women wearing the hoods and all over german tv women wear hijabs now and they teach the women
[46:03.200 --> 46:09.360]  to wear hijabs there's an article today in four wars dot com paul joseph watson german headmaster
[46:09.360 --> 46:16.800]  tells mother of daughter who was bullied by muslims to cover up with a hijab because in most austrian
[46:16.800 --> 46:23.440]  and german schools in fact nationwide in austria half of the children are quote migrants
[46:25.600 --> 46:32.160]  does that give you the level of the invasion half and the muslims are like you're not wearing a hijab
[46:33.200 --> 46:38.400]  we're going to beat you up we're going to physically assault you in many cases we're
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.400]  going to rape you and then what does the head of the green party say she's a woman she said
[46:42.400 --> 46:48.320]  stop wearing short many skirts and wear a bracelet saying don't rape me
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.520]  there was a problem though obviously the men didn't read german and they didn't care
[47:02.000 --> 47:11.120]  oh it's so liberal and the truth is the left like a baby duck that has been imprinted
[47:11.120 --> 47:15.120]  on its mommy you ever seen baby duck if its mama's not around when it hatches it thinks
[47:15.120 --> 47:20.080]  a dog is its mama thinks a person's it's it's you know it's mama and will follow you around
[47:20.080 --> 47:29.760]  for the rest of its life basically worshiping you and it's the same thing they imprint them
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.800]  in the schools they imprint them hating christians hating guns hating money hating wealth hating
[47:36.800 --> 47:45.920]  masculinity hating strength hating everything except what is anti-western and it doesn't
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.440]  matter if it's a stone age religion and completely patriarchal and and and monotheistic and everything
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.120]  they say they hate if it's allied against the west and if it's vicious and if it's muscle
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.880]  and if it can be used to get the rest of the west to get rid of its rights to then not antagonize
[48:02.880 --> 48:10.560]  our little visitors if they can use western hospitality against us they can win and they
[48:10.560 --> 48:16.160]  believe then manage islam which is like managing a good case of brain cancer
[48:21.120 --> 48:26.000]  so i'm gonna open the phones up and i'm gonna take your calls on this subject on the russia
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.120]  escalation on facebook microsoft knows that facebook's been caught breaking in your phone
[48:31.120 --> 48:37.040]  spying everything you're doing with ai told you that years ago well guess what
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.920]  microsoft just changed the terms of service so you're involved with any microsoft devices they
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.480]  say they have a right to access your hard drives and all your information to make sure you're a
[48:50.480 --> 48:54.720]  good person and just like apple and droid won't let you send cuss words when you're trying to type
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.640]  them guess what they're not going to let you send emails nothing everything you do is going to be
[48:58.640 --> 49:03.520]  read they've already been doing it but old bill gates that doesn't pay any taxes he's about to
[49:03.520 --> 49:14.560]  slap you upside the head
[49:18.480 --> 49:26.480]  this is the heart of 1776 you're a white male it's also what happens when you listen to the radio
[49:26.480 --> 49:38.800]  host alex jones we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag
[49:43.280 --> 49:50.400]  it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning i will not let you down you'll be very very
[49:50.400 --> 49:56.480]  impressed by home and i think we'll be speaking a lot no trump in alex jones this means the dama
[49:56.480 --> 50:06.320]  trump will be the 45th president of the united states waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[50:06.320 --> 50:16.480]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for example
[50:21.200 --> 50:24.960]  alex jones the foray conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[50:32.080 --> 50:32.960]  alex jones
[50:32.960 --> 50:38.400]  scott russian scott
[50:41.760 --> 50:43.040]  if a war comes to mind
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.280]  reputation is amazing i will not let you down you'll be very very impressed i hope
[50:53.280 --> 51:02.480]  it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones
[51:05.120 --> 51:11.200]  who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs i don't know
[51:12.240 --> 51:20.160]  what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that the russians
[51:20.160 --> 51:30.640]  ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election
[51:30.640 --> 51:38.080]  and then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies within the
[51:39.440 --> 51:46.560]  internet world like info wars take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous outlandish
[51:46.560 --> 51:53.200]  absurd lies you can imagine but trump doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on jones's
[51:53.200 --> 52:03.280]  show and said your reputation is amazing i will not let you down waging war on corruption
[52:03.280 --> 52:08.560]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[52:08.560 --> 52:20.640]  if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states for an outright
[52:20.640 --> 52:27.440]  ban picking up every one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have done it
[52:27.440 --> 52:33.200]  when they give us that inch that bump stock ban we will take a mile you've heard people say
[52:33.200 --> 52:43.440]  you'll have to pry my gun for my whole day okay we have introduced an assault weapons
[52:43.440 --> 52:50.560]  brand i'm talking about a ban on assault rifles if you listen real close you can hear the people
[52:50.560 --> 52:56.080]  in power shaking it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every
[52:56.080 --> 53:01.280]  monday we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[53:01.280 --> 53:09.840]  about guns in a vastly different way enough enough enough we say no more even the presentation
[53:09.840 --> 53:15.520]  during the march for life rally in washington dc subjected the participants with no thy
[53:15.520 --> 53:20.720]  enemy style exposition where took the guns Stalin took the guns if you try to take our
[53:20.720 --> 53:24.880]  firearms doesn't matter how many linings you get out there on the street begging for them to have
[53:24.880 --> 53:32.720]  their guns taken we will not relinquish them a great example of how the average liberal sshw
[53:32.720 --> 53:39.280]  is so stupid and uneducated on the matters of gun control not one of them can tell me what
[53:39.280 --> 53:43.360]  they're marching for do you think the imperials would want to take the guns in star wars i can
[53:43.360 --> 53:50.480]  talk to you i hate it this is amazing this is amazing goons is a conspiracy theorist he says
[53:50.480 --> 53:57.120]  that we want your guns which we do but you're still insane if you say we do i'm quoting from
[53:57.120 --> 54:03.120]  the legislation right here the georgia bureau of investigations shall seize and take possession
[54:03.120 --> 54:08.560]  possession of any assault weapon large capacity magazine armor piercer bullet or incendiary 50
[54:08.560 --> 54:14.800]  caliber bullet shall seize and take possession of that's not voluntary that's mandatory do you
[54:14.800 --> 54:24.320]  know what assault weapon is yeah it's um assault weapon it's like um i i kind of do but kind of
[54:24.320 --> 54:28.880]  don't the same amount of people died by assault weapons as do car crashes in a given year um
[54:28.880 --> 54:34.160]  as what do car crashes it's a similar number okay it's it's not actually but isn't it similar
[54:34.160 --> 54:39.440]  have you ever fired an ar-15 uh yeah do you know the difference between an ar-15 and an automatic
[54:39.440 --> 54:48.560]  attack dead lives no that's not the difference you don't know and and an ar-15 is a semi-automatic
[54:48.560 --> 54:52.960]  weapon it's no different than a hunting rifle or a handgun the worst people out there man
[54:53.520 --> 54:59.280]  take this and and also let let let let it be known that hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.000]  of young kids who are about to be in the voting booths are going to destroy your dreams we say
[55:04.000 --> 55:14.640]  no more if you want them come and take them i tell you folks these are strange days
[55:15.600 --> 55:22.800]  if you just joined us the big news depending on the poll five to 20 points on average about 15
[55:22.800 --> 55:30.640]  points in national polls where they sample 10 to 15 to 20 points more for democrats to skew them
[55:30.640 --> 55:34.720]  to make it look like americanism and free market is unpopular
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.880]  despite all that trump and republicans across the country can pull the articles up
[55:40.880 --> 55:48.400]  have surged the articles are on infowars.com again as much as 20 points and suddenly the
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.560]  democrats have come out and said nobody wants your guns we don't want to take any remember
[55:52.560 --> 55:58.800]  biden when obama was first running going nobody wants your handgun not your shotgun not your semi-auto
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.360]  nothing we don't want to take any of the guns nobody wants to confiscate any of your guns
[56:03.360 --> 56:08.000]  nobody's coming after your guns we understand law abiding citizens stop way more crime than
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.120]  criminals cause and a lot of blue collar americans were like well i want to vote for that black guy
[56:14.560 --> 56:18.080]  i want to bring people together i kind of like him he's like a reagan democrat
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.360]  and it was the very same people look it up just type in even politico admits it the same
[56:25.360 --> 56:31.360]  white people that voted in obama are the t demographic that voted in trump and they just want
[56:31.360 --> 56:39.360]  prosperity and they just want all the the bickering and globalism to stop and guess what it is
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.000]  starting to stop ladies and gentlemen now we've got big zuckerberg news coming up the next
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.840]  segment this could bring him down this is the biggest ever this is really important and then

[57:19.040 --> 57:24.320]  first-time callers long-time callers you agree you disagree we're going to take your phone calls
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.800]  on any subject you want to talk about but the guns are front and center and so much more
[57:29.600 --> 57:34.080]  now i mentioned this i'm just going to play it since i talked about it this is komo saying
[57:34.080 --> 57:41.520]  that supreme court justice first he hopes that the former congressman on there doesn't know
[57:41.520 --> 57:47.040]  that all these people like feinstein and and and folks are calling for repeal the second amendment
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.760]  and then once he knows what is going on he then tries to change the subject and say oh
[57:51.760 --> 57:56.320]  he didn't really mean that no you guys just take the guns in every democrat county and state and
[57:56.320 --> 57:59.920]  city and all these other countries have taken the guns and the exact same formula and your
[57:59.920 --> 58:05.520]  internal documents say that but now you're going to lie to us again kwomo here it is brother and
[58:05.520 --> 58:09.680]  you got the president of the united states this morning tweeting that the second amendment will
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.240]  never be repealed we must have more repose who's calling for repeal the second amendment well
[58:14.240 --> 58:18.480]  who's calling for justice stevens did but that's not it was in the context of a conversation about
[58:18.480 --> 58:22.800]  the fastest route to legal change and of course if you hadn't didn't have a second amendment you
[58:22.800 --> 58:27.680]  wouldn't have heller it would be easier to change the law to stop right there i remember
[58:27.680 --> 58:32.160]  they used to say the second amendment wasn't a right to keep their arms now the supreme court
[58:32.160 --> 58:38.480]  ruled yes it is you can go back to what the founder said he more on those the war started komo
[58:40.400 --> 58:45.040]  because people tried to come take the guns in 1775 at lexington concord
[58:45.040 --> 58:50.960]  i understand as a ruling family your family was back in idly ruling over serfs and slaves
[58:50.960 --> 58:54.480]  you got that instinct not want little people having stuff a lot of great italians came over
[58:54.480 --> 58:58.160]  here to want to get away from people like you and now they got a second amendment whether people
[58:58.160 --> 59:13.040]  like you like it or not mr komo resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones

[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:29.360]  the nose and i'm serious i have three daughters and it's not virtue signaling for me to fundamentally
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:34.400]  say that you fake feminists leading women into bondage under islam and all the horrible things
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:38.880]  you do to women because you want to make sure they end up being alone and and having the state as
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:47.600]  their husband you make me sick your con artist your filth your enemies in all your guilt trip and all

[1:00:54.560 --> 1:01:00.640]  broken that you globalists have on people because i feel sorry for people that are under your dominion
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:08.400]  now i want to hit some biggest news yet on facebook ever and it's so big that i tend to hold back on
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:12.080]  news like this just because it's so crazy i don't even know how to like
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:20.240]  approach it because there's so many angles i got too many words it's just too ridiculous
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:26.720]  and i don't want to just chatter and jibber like i do like some crazy monkey and in the background
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:31.680]  noise i do i mean i'm the worst at that i know that all these important topics and i'm just up here
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:38.640]  gibbering them off trying to warn you that's all i know to do i have faith in you but this guy is such
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:47.840]  a scumbag and the people running him are such scumbags and he's such a fake grinning clearly a
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:58.080]  psychotic psychopath sociopath power tripping reprobate soulless person and then facebook is
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:08.800]  such a soul-sucking creature that it makes me want to throw up and see i just started thinking about
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:15.360]  zuckerberg and if i don't explain this exactly right it helps them because that's what they do
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:20.000]  they use their own evil to then get us to go along with new programs to clean up the evil that's
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:29.840]  actually the full takeover yeah print me that article please you know the London mayor got urged
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:34.160]  to lead a campaign on female genital mutilation but he won't do it because he's an islamicist
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:40.320]  he's a surreal law guy and then the poor woman leading it gets banned on twitter i mean twitter's
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:48.720]  real bad folks these aren't liberals it's like was it co-bear a couple of those shows made fun of
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:56.080]  me last year when i went hillary supported the takeover of libya and now they've killed
[1:02:56.960 --> 1:03:01.120]  50 000 plus black people because the wahhabis don't think they're human you can look that up
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:07.120]  they have a horrible derogatory term i won't use here on air and they said
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:14.720]  yeah print me that too thanks talking to the crew
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.520]  and when i talked about hillary saying i came i saw he died taking Gaddafi out
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:26.480]  he was working with the west stabilizing all africa spending 99% of his money on the people
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:30.400]  women were outranking men in college women weren't wearing hijabs it was incredible
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:36.480]  six months after they took over hundreds of thousands dead hundreds of thousands of slave
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:41.920]  women 50 plus thousand dead africans admittedly just killed because they're black sexual mutilization
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:47.680]  mutilization inventing words like jesse jackson sexual mutilation on a mass scale
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:57.440]  and then they made jokes online going what's a slave block well they got a block that you
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:02.400]  marked somebody upstairs it's called a slave block they've had them since egypt and you sell
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:09.600]  slaves on top of them and they've got antique slave blocks in places like libya and places
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:15.360]  like tunisia and now the muslims have reopened those markets and are selling women on them
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:22.560]  you got that you evil slack jod satanic fake leftist scum that know we have a conscience
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:26.880]  so you manipulate our conscience all day and say turn your guns in or you hurt the kids or
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:31.760]  the west hurts women and all this crud when west has empowered women
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:42.960]  you know why women got the right to vote and why all the women got empowered in the west
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:51.440]  because the secret religion that predates the globalists and the luciferian system and it's
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:56.880]  not a religion i adhere to but i understand it and i know i can call it how the roza crucian merger
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:05.040]  with the british isles and all beyond mystery religions but the west worships women and in
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:12.880]  many other ancient cultures that was the case but in the west women are worshiped as the holy grail
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:20.640]  and so that's why women got empowered in the west because they're worshiped in the west
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:25.920]  and you go to british war memorials or u.s war memorials and you see a goddess always pointing
[1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:31.520]  across the street at a war memorial they'll say 200 000 dead infantrymen there'll be another
[1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:39.920]  memorial right next to it 50 something thousand dead uh artillery men it'll say a sacrifice to
[1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:46.240]  britainia and britainia is right across reaching her hand out at the dead men and the dead men are
[1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:55.360]  already sacrificed to britainia and then and and the hollywood scum all know this they're all
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:59.280]  devil worshipers folks you think they want to empower women they want to throw everybody down
[1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:04.800]  families women anything strong anything pure anything good that's their power is sucking the
[1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:10.880]  life force out of women sucking it out of the earth killing the earth and then they tell you
[1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:16.800]  they are earth worshipers and they love women and they want to empower women and they want to save
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:22.560]  the earth when they're the ones trying to create a new artificial intelligence and new life to replace
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:29.200]  women to replace the planet to replace the goddess these are satanists these are enemies
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:36.240]  interdimensional borders whatever you want to call them they want to kill the planet
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:46.000]  and hitler hated christianity and hitler hated god and hitler said first you get the women
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:53.280]  then you've got the children so follow the men and these are the truths they don't want you to know
[1:06:54.880 --> 1:07:01.520]  it is the most outrageous fraud if you know anthropology sociology cultural ethos and
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:08.240]  this whole system to sit here and say the west treats women bad when they are boarding us
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:16.640]  with tens of millions of islamic military age men whose religion is debasing and enslaving women
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:25.440]  there's a spirit and the average leftist has now fully downloaded it they are the average
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:34.240]  leftist is a dumb stupid empty zombie they are the enemy and they will suck your soul so fast
[1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:38.240]  because what's the zombie one it wants brains because it ain't got it it's metaphysical

[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:47.280]  for a week that's fine i'm going to keep it at 50 percent off i'll explain this we just went out
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.360]  and said what are the top healthy new tropics that are seen by the FDA is safe they call it grass
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:58.560]  it was a law they passed and we we looked at a couple top selling formulas and kind of
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:04.080]  changed them up and then fused them and then made it stronger and then don't charge you retail 80
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:10.960]  and then discount it for $59 no you know we put $10 a product and something and then we got
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:15.520]  marketing other stuff let's say it's costing us 15 bucks a bottle then we sell it to you know for
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:23.840]  $35 whatever well right now it's 1995 and again i asked him i said why are we going to sell this
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:27.200]  almost at cost he said because it makes it people buy all the other products when they're in there
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:32.400]  and this just helps fund the operation and he's right but we're selling it for 1995 and this is
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.880]  better than stuff that sells for $60 discounted i mean it's good and that's our philosophy 100 to
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:45.040]  150 markup not five to seven times industry standard highest quality we know we're under the gun
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:49.680]  they're testing everything we do they're watching it plus i i would still have it be the very best
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:55.360]  even if i knew we weren't being tested under the gun think about that so brain force plus

[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.440]  by the harvard alum and the harvard mafia and the globalist out of all these different systems
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.000]  let the media promote him promote this model that was already out there so the cia and others
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.400]  who get databases on everybody but so they could also make huge amounts of money and let the harvard
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:44.160]  alumni that's what the emails are there's hundreds of them spy on everybody else in the harvard mafia
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:51.120]  so what it is is an nsa that you opt into and it's data mining is bigger than the nsa many
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:55.760]  experts are saying i'm not sure that's true but it's definitely the biggest private data mining
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:00.480]  out there now they want to do this analytic a deal that's a mid-sized company compared to others
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:04.960]  doing data mining open source all sorts of weird stuff bad stuff you name it on both sides working
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:09.360]  for everybody mercenary group well once you open it up of course then people go well that's zucker
[1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:16.320]  burg's main job it's what he does so now he's on the rocks and now it's come out that they're spying
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:23.040]  on everybody and that they're breaking into your phones and that they're downloading all your contacts
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:28.080]  and then integrating that with other databases and it's all illegal so what is microsoft announced
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:34.400]  yesterday and i've got the articles right here they've already been doing this too so they put it
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.520]  the terms of service just like samsung did three years ago samsung said we're watching and listening
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:43.840]  everything you do in your house and we're selling to third parties they said so be careful what you
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:52.240]  say or do wow wow so that so microsoft just saw them tank 40 billion dropped out of them amazon
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:57.200]  just lost 40 billion this is all coming out this trump says you're not going to be tax exempt anymore
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:01.920]  you're not going to get a dollar 48 on every package from taxpayers oh yeah it's woodshed time
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:05.920]  trumps delivering that these folks are trying to shut us down and shut him down and screwing over
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:12.320]  us taxpayers and consumers so that's in the news and i've got the articles here we'll play this clip
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:16.800]  but remember who told you they were spying on all this remember who told you this was going on
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.720]  remember i told you about the databases because i had nsa whistleblowers so here's zucker burg in
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:27.600]  2009 on bbc with his little psycho fake eyes a little puppy little baby seal oh we you own your
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:32.320]  data oh we don't share it with nobody oh no he'd already written the emails calling you done effort
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:38.240]  back then so let's go to this little psychopath frontman for the cia here he is so who is going
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:43.760]  to own the facebook content the person who puts it there or you the person who's putting the content
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:48.160]  on facebook always owns the information and that's why this is such an important thing and and why
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:52.640]  facebook is such a special service that people feel a lot of ownership over right this is their
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:57.280]  information they own it and they often want to know of course not i mean they they want to share it
[1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:03.440]  with um with only a few people just to be clear you're not going to sell or share any of the
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:08.880]  information on facebook what the terms say is just we're not going to share people's information
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:13.840]  except for the people that they've asked for it to be shared that we shouldn't put that out last week
[1:17:13.840 --> 1:17:21.600]  a total sociopath i say psychopathic but the point is you look at those eyes i mean you know

[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:45.040]  who is up first here we've got uh john in the great state of texas which we'll see we won't
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:48.320]  say is under globalist control i'm not actually be able to say it's under american control again
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:53.600]  but uh john thank you for calling in what do you think about the whole gun grabbed the buckle
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:57.120]  have they killed their blue wave admit they want to confiscate the guns now they're trying to walk
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:02.800]  that back what do you what do you say john well i want to talk about this bump stock issue because
[1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:08.080]  i think Trump were trying to sucker them on the sucker in the left on the bump stocks because
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:13.360]  basically the atf has ruled three different times that the united turned semi-autos in the machine
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:20.400]  guns the law of state specifically what a semi-auto is and what a machine gun and plus the commentary
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:25.600]  the comment section they had before they started debating on this there were 75 percent of people
[1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:30.400]  were against it but i think he knows that the atf just gonna say unless they change the law i'll tell
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:36.160]  you there ain't nothing we can do about it well that's it trump can act executive unilaterally
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:40.960]  on the second amendment i don't even like him implying he can and it's true the atf keeps trying
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:45.840]  to arrest people if they're ar-15 malfunctions and kind of shoots a few extra shots we all
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:51.440]  know about those famous cases and that's them trying to legislate as a bureaucracy uh which
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:59.440]  has been found unconstitutional uh but i i was told off record and part of it on record that
[1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:04.880]  trump was suckering them going oh yeah you're gonna win to get them to say and that's what
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:09.920]  duje told me on tape and also off tape and i was also told by congressman that we're going with
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:14.560]  trump he seems to uncannily know he believes if we act like we're for this they'll come out and call
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:21.280]  for a total ban and it'll blow up in their face and they did it so trump is something else man
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:27.920]  it uh that uh you don't need a bump stock to bump fire well i'm about to say bump stocks are worthless
[1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:34.240]  pieces of crud i never i was a combat infantryman in vietnam and i never used to pull out a once
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:38.480]  but i got one because i like playing around with the range a little bit but yeah you know it is
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:44.320]  i just lost audio are you guys getting his audio yeah it's almost like a haunted house in here
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:50.000]  ladies audio works i like yeah yeah call her go ahead i just said that i was an infantryman
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.840]  in vietnam and i never used to pull out a once and all the firefights i would then but i have a
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:58.880]  bump stock because i just like to play with it on the range once in a while but uh but all bump
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:04.320]  stock all bump all semi-autos can can be can be bump fire this is going to affect all semi-autos
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:10.080]  if the atf should rule it could affect all semi-automates because all semi-automates can fire
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:17.120]  like machine guns if you bump fire or put a rubber band around trigger i'm getting every other word
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:20.880]  you're saying brother but no but i hear what you're saying uh and i get even though bumps
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:24.880]  stocks are kind of just a toy and never been using a crime till vegas there was a stand down it was an
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:31.360]  islamic civil war deals spill over from saudi arabia you know i get all that now uh and i think the
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:36.080]  public is it i just don't like trump even going along with the rhetoric but i get it he was smoking
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:40.160]  them out of their holes to get them to come out and say what they really wanted and it's been
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:44.640]  a spectacular blow-up in their face and it's just woken up the sleeping conservatives
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:48.720]  and patriots john uh a great point god bless you i appreciate your call
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:25:00.160]  now um let's go ahead and take some more calls here let's go ahead and talk to eric in indiana
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:09.280]  eric heard on the year you moderate to reject yeah i just got fed a couple calls same time
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:14.080]  that audio about one tenth of one percent i can barely hear you i'm gonna try again eric go ahead
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:21.920]  hello alex yes go ahead i just wanted to tell you i just ordered me a couple bottles of brain
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:27.280]  force new shirt for me awesome secret 12 it is great i want to give you a little plug in first
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:32.000]  thanks well thank you sir without you they hate the fact that we have community that we have a
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:37.280]  culture that that we're building an infrastructure promoting our ideals of freedom they cannot that's
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:41.040]  what i want to kill free market to begin with because it's an engine that does things they
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:45.920]  don't control they hate the great products you guys have because they're they're trying to poison
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:51.360]  us every way they can with the kim trails oh my god above where i'm in southern indiana it is
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:58.080]  horrible and i take pictures and you know anyway second amendment all i got to say is
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:02.240]  they keep trying to refill this and there's going to be more people coming out of the
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:07.920]  woodworks that are gun owners to protect their family and farms and everybody's going to vote
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:13.280]  and they're going to come close to us and they can keep coming to get it i'm going to go buy
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:22.400]  me new rifles just because well look the bottom line is the ethos of america is that everyone
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:28.960]  couldn't own weapons unless they were authorized quote nobility and then in america we could
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.360]  switzerland you could william tell is their ethos true story look at what happened there with the
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:37.520]  apple and the crossbow and all of it that really happened and you know they kicked the foreigners
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:42.400]  out the globalist out basically as it was the germans but that's what we've been through as
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:49.040]  an ethos we know when they take your weapons you're enslaved uh and so that's how the country
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:55.200]  founded texas happened when santa anna come to take the guns and so we're back there again and
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.800]  they try to push this whole narrative that there can't be one more death by a gun there's always
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:02.640]  going to be criminals the idea that we are to blame because somebody else commits a crime
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.520]  is the essence of authoritarianism eric what do you think of the job trumps doing overall
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:14.000]  oh i mean i'm i like it i like how he's like you said i don't like it how he goes along with him
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.280]  but i love how he plays him they're still they're so stupid it's like you know i said these people
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:26.160]  are stupid absolutely but i you know it's not a play with this omnibus bill that was bad but
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:29.760]  that's congress and they don't want to stall the economy but bottom line imagine where we
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:33.280]  be with hillary right now we should keep trumps feet the fire we should be running people for
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:38.320]  congress we should be educating people the war has just begun if people really want the republic back
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:42.240]  and not to have the department of education in the un and hollywood running our lives who they
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:47.040]  admit in their own videos their own documents they hate our guts these are globalist elitists
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:51.680]  that have again imprinted on hating america and it's all about who wants it the most and they
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:56.160]  know we're awakening so they're trying to bully back in right now this is their counter offensive

[1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:44.720]  this story about trump on the run past you and see what you think about it um one thing about
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:49.360]  upcoming gun rallies coming up this month and then i also wanted to plug for you if you allow
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:54.320]  sure go ahead brother thanks all right so this story i've had about trump for a while
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:58.080]  we know what trump is a brilliant strategist with all the 40 chest and everything
[1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:04.960]  but with this latest master stroke that he just pulled i think my theory is true
[1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:13.760]  i think that bruce lane is not batman donald trump is batman am i talking goofy campy adam
[1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:20.640]  west batman i'm talking frank miller gd batman always got contingency plan and kicks back
[1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:23.840]  superman's butt on the regular well i mean yeah he is from gotham too
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:33.600]  um also i wanted to uh really quick i see it upcoming um this group i don't know about
[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:38.560]  they're called the national constitutional coalition of patriotic americans um they're
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:44.400]  trying to get gun rallies going um in every state capital yeah well i don't know who they are but i
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:50.720]  support it we need to just get out there yeah it looks like it's going to be um april 14th
[1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:57.440]  at every state capital so i'm planning on going to one here in new york um and then let's go
[1:30:57.440 --> 1:31:02.240]  i agree and on on patreon today too i don't care if it's one person but it'll be more than that
[1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:07.040]  people didn't see that more come out everybody should go to their state capitals and it doesn't
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:11.120]  matter of mainstream media doesn't cover you streaming on youtube streaming on facebook
[1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:17.920]  put it on local tv you know whatever just get involved we've got to get moving here but but
[1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:23.360]  listen was it a master stroke by trump trying to sound political and abating the left to come out
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:27.680]  with what they really wanted or was it them being a bunch of arrogant idiots because you know they
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:32.400]  always go oh just be reasonable just don't let kids die and then that's always the police stand down
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:37.680]  in a liberal city and some prozac head kills people and it's still incredibly rare i'm not
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:44.560]  saying it's not horrible but it's like the federal numbers vary it's never more than 50 it's like 37
[1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:51.840]  48 it's less than 50 kids a year get shot in mass shootings and that's too many but it's still
[1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:57.120]  incredibly rare and most of its gangbangers killing each other what do you think all right
[1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:00.720]  agree i think it's a little bit of bulk and it's interesting yesterday i was watching the show and
[1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:06.560]  about 20 minutes a half hour before um Paul was on talking about how they're trying to walk stuff
[1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:11.680]  back i started noticing on social media these articles um saying oh maybe it's not a good idea
[1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:16.240]  we repeal the second amendment and and then people in the comment section saying oh you know
[1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:22.000]  we can't be this radical this is too far calling for the repeal and saying exactly hey guys don't
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.440]  tell them we're gonna hang them up by their toes and slit their throats exactly let me tell you
[1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:29.760]  something they got a bunch of camp followers and cowards and idiots and mental patients as their
[1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:38.000]  minions but when you get mid-level democrat they are craven cowardly evil parasites and i've had
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:42.560]  them threaten me and go of course we're evil of course we're running scams of course we own guns
[1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:47.840]  it's like Al Sharpton's brother just got arrested one day after his anti-gun march shooting a woman
[1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:58.720]  in the head twice in a drive-by reportedly i mean you know it's like of course some gang banging
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:06.800]  thug wants your guns great points god bless you we'll be back with more phone calls and then we've
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:22.720]  got a victim of islamic terror joining us stay with us
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:34.240]  we now take you live to the central texas command center
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:42.640]  in the heart of the resistance it's alex jones shazia hobs joins us for the next 30 minutes
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:49.600]  that will continue with your phone calls we've got uh another special guest joining us from the
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:58.000]  uk as well um who's been banned from twitter today mr robbins but miss hobs is the daughter of a
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.560]  pakistani muslim father and scottish catholic mother born in glaslaw scotland and raised in a
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:09.520]  polygamous home she was forced into marriage when she was 18 years old she left after almost
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:15.680]  three years of hell the only time in her life when she thought of suicide she has disavowed by her
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.640]  father and the entire pakistani community for leaving the marriage she was volunteered and
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:26.560]  worked for bme charities and raising awareness and helping women who suffer like she did is
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:33.520]  something she is very passionate about she now writes at alt news media about her biggest passion
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:40.240]  to raise awareness about the abuse of muslim children by muslim men and again she is uh at
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:45.760]  alt news media alt news media dot net and so miss hobs thank you so much for joining us i think you
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:50.880]  should start with your own story and then the big story i've got here we should probably pull the
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:54.000]  clip up i forgot to tell the crew that's my fault most of the time looks like i'm mad at the crew
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:59.200]  i'm frustrated with myself because i'm supposed to plan this out as the main producer um con was
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:04.880]  here a week and a half ago the islamic mayor who's banning women in swimsuit ads in london on
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:10.480]  on buses i mean it's just incredible protecting all these islamists is coming in and
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:19.040]  he uses one of her tweets about do something about genital mutilation knowing trindy's in
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:23.600]  austin wouldn't even know about that and going look i'm being threatened with my genitals being cut
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:29.360]  off and then she got banned off twitter so tommy robinson just got banned today that this is a
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:35.520]  giant purge and this you keep doing it until they think we're just going to give up london mayor
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:45.360]  sadeek khan calls for silicon valley to in free speech so shazia thank you so much for joining
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:51.680]  i've followed you i'm already aware of you you're very polite you're very nice you're very well
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  spoken uh you just are politely asking the mayor uh to lead a campaign on female genital mutilation
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:03.840]  and then they the the left bans you and hates you and lend us or sir says it doesn't matter
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:09.200]  she said the women not wearing hijabs uh and wanting to be able to be free and and i ran our
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:17.840]  evil it should shut up i mean how did the left embrace the most orthodox oppressive forms of
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:23.840]  islam we'll get to that but but but first uh just you got the floor your story you're awakening
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:28.560]  what it's like inside islam so that other women you know here it's the ultimate feminist thing to
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:32.800]  get on a plane to saudi arabia and you know get chained up against the wall for 10 years i mean
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:37.440]  they're being told this is the sacrament of the left this is gloria steinham's ambrosia
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:42.960]  how did this warp thing happen is this stockum syndrome is it a form of uh the left wanting to
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:48.560]  cut women what's happening i'm not really too sure what's happening the these women live in the
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:54.160]  rest i'm and a lot of them will be free you know they have they have the freedoms in the west
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:37:01.600]  i am but there are just as many women that live in the west that don't have freedom i was forced
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:08.400]  into a marriage when i was 18 it's the only time in my life where i have really seriously
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:16.880]  contemplated suicide it's just you know it's it's awful it's like to be forced to marry
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:23.280]  a man that you don't love you don't have anything in common with and then to have the the mayor of
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:30.800]  london that he has a platform he he could be the he claims to be a feminist he could be the voice
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:36.160]  for so many women that he knows that are forced into marriage in his community taken out of school
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:44.480]  so not allowed to complete their education forced to marry you know a life of misery a life of making
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:52.240]  to parties and making babies i mean this is the true slavery that women claim ultra leftist
[1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:57.200]  that that any patriarch he has this is is this not slavery i mean making you i mean
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:03.120]  some women as young as 12 13 10 the prophet Muhammad nine-year-old i mean this is pakistan
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:09.440]  uh turkey is trying to legalize sex with nine-year-old girls i mean it's it's beyond even enslavement
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:16.800]  it's pedophilia and and for some strange reason they won't you know we don't have feminist marching
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:22.720]  and their thousands we'll have them marching the uk because they don't want trump to come and visit
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:28.640]  we'll they'll take to the streets for that but for women that are forced into marriage we have
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:33.280]  we have a law in the uk now that it's illegal to force your child into marriage so where are
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:41.680]  the protesting for this well i mean you deal with just the abuse of children period under
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:47.440]  islam and the beating of you know people severely public torture you name it but specifically on
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:55.680]  the sexual mutilation or or women being mutilated when they're babies the left makes jokes about
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:39:00.080]  this they make jokes about women being sold on slave blocks uh after hillary liberated
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:08.240]  libya what can you testify to folks goes on inside islam with young girls babies and con
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:13.360]  spinning it as if you saying police stop mutilation will send up a threat on him
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:20.720]  you know he read out he read out a few different tweets as well he read out one where he said that
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:26.320]  somebody called him a sparrow i don't see anything hateful about that at all he read out another one
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:31.680]  that somebody had called him a pigeon and then he read out the tweet that i asked you know i asked
[1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:36.880]  him will the full force of the law be brought down on on parents who mutilate their their daughters
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:43.040]  vagina's and he read that out as a hate speech which is just absolutely nonsense so saying don't
[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:48.880]  mutilate little girls is the act of hate no you're trying to lovingly stop it but they transmute it
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:54.560]  like alchemy that that just sounds hateful about stop stand up for little girls vaginas
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:59.760]  he and he knows western audiences may not knows what just sounds hateful no he knows full well
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:10.000]  there's we don't have an exact number of how many girls are have been cut in the uk they reckon
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:17.680]  that they put they estimate the figure at 137 000 and we have fpm clinics open to deal with the
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:24.000]  aftermath we have a zero tolerance day for fpm we have bme charities that are given funding
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:30.240]  but we have not one single parent that has been punished it's child abuse you know if i beat my
[1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:35.200]  daughter well i can see there's one argument for circumcision and other against i think people
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.200]  should be able to choose it because there's a you know there's evidence that that it is is
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:43.840]  arcane and bad but with women they're not even saying it's for a health issue they say so a
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.360]  woman can't have pleasure later in life cutting their clitoris off that's for documentary purposes
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:54.240]  folks so this is an adult show children's show but people need to be executed it's an informational
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:59.840]  show i mean that is serious serious serious abuse there is not even an argument for medical reasons
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:06.400]  there's none there's absolutely no reason there's no reason for male circumcision either
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:15.440]  i am you know they're they're cutting healthy babies for no reason but to please men you know
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:22.160]  because it's a priest class wanting to be over and controlling procreation i mean you're absolutely
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:31.120]  right i'm just saying with that they claim there's a medical issue but with the but under Islam they
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:37.040]  just say women shouldn't have pleasure so they're they're not even saying it's medical is my point
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:43.520]  yep they don't want women to be promiscuous you know so we made it illegal in 1985 in the
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:54.240]  uk we never ever should have had a special law for hgm it's child abuse and it's just completely wrong
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:01.280]  why do you think khan misrepresented you and demonized you and inside it with millions of little
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:08.640]  girls having their generals cut off i have no idea honestly i really don't know why i can't
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:14.560]  understand how he could stand there like how can he stand there and read that out and think that
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:20.880]  people are going to believe it's his speech like it's just it's just it's really what the left
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:28.560]  does do they just misrepresent what we say that's what they do well i want to go to break because
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:31.200]  i've been asked the questions you're a great lady have a lot of courage and you've been leading
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.600]  international movement to do this you've been banned i know and blocked on twitter i want to talk about
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:41.840]  that uh and i know they brought you back up after you got attention to this but uh people can follow
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:47.760]  you there on on twitter and we'll tell folks about that on the other side but we need to really get
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:53.600]  in the face of fake feminists because they're not just given islam a pass they are actively acting
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:43:01.120]  like it is the best thing on earth but the west is bad and that really boils my blood we'll be right
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:06.000]  back i'm alex jones news wars dot com please spread that link they hope you don't the globalist
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:19.120]  are trying to censor us just like we're censoring her so here's sadeek khan calling for an end of
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:24.320]  the first amendment dubbing at hate speech at south by southwest the head of youtube came and gave
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:28.640]  the same speech and i got a big stack of articles calling for you to be banned today i mean this is
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:34.480]  the real tyranny we're witnessing here in the us and worldwide but humanity is awakening and here is
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:42.880]  sadeek khan reading shazia hobbs tweet out of context like he's being harassed when she's calling
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:50.320]  for him to speak out and be a spokesperson as the islamic mayor of london against sexual mutilation
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:58.640]  of little girls so here it is if you use a knife to mutilate your daughter's vagina will the full
[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:05.040]  force of the law be brought down than you asking for a muslim let's work together to end this hate
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:13.200]  so if you point out that almost all the girls in pakistan you name it now it's happening to tens
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:18.000]  of thousands in england sexual grooming they spin it they don't address what they're doing
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:23.040]  like david hog we're going to ban your guns you know we're coming out the second amendment
[1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:28.240]  you're shaking in fear okay well i think that's pretty hitlerian oh my god you just talked about
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:34.800]  about a child i want to ban you you're hateful it's like man they're drama queens while they're
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:43.920]  trying to get our rights show shazia hobbs what was it like going under islam what have you witnessed
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:49.520]  the grooming all the things why is the left ally with islam you know you're leading this worldwide
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:53.200]  movement you're being blocked and banned you were banned on twitter for a while you're back
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:56.480]  tell folks how people can follow you on twitter i mean let's talk about the censorship
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:06.400]  um i got i think my first ban was last summer i am and most of the things that i tweet about you
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:13.680]  know we obviously have a problem with rape gangs um in the uk but the forgotten victims are muslim
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:18.720]  children nobody really speaks about the muslim children that are raped by muslim men so i would
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:25.120]  tweet about that quite a lot and i would get obviously mass reported and and the suspended
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:31.600]  mark out me and i've managed to i keep coming back because you can always come back through the
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:36.320]  the suspension and then i've got a seven day ban the the week that said he can
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:44.160]  was in america and he read out the the tweet i was on a seven day ban for saying that muslim
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:49.920]  children muslim girls are annually raped by muslim men so they can spill bevergence on their
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:56.640]  way to night because virginity is you know such an honorable thing you you have to be a virgin
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:05.440]  on your way to night um so yeah it's just it's really strange that all these feminists and said
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:10.560]  it can like i had said earlier who said that he's a feminist and he knows that this goes on in our
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:16.720]  community that the pakistani community is not or the muslim community is not you know muslim
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:22.560]  children aren't born with a special shield that protects them from pedophiles and whenever you
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:28.480]  talk about this you always get people saying white men rape white men rape their kids white men do
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:34.880]  this white men do that and you know the catholic church and jimmy saville and we know we talk about
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:42.880]  that you know and we're disgusted by it so why can't we speak about the muslim community why
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:49.760]  when ever we want to speak about muslim children and wanting to protect muslim children there's
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:54.720]  always this deflection that you know i'll look about christian you know if you're talking about
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:47:00.880]  muslims then talk about christians what they're doing to their children but when we do talk about
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:07.920]  christian pedophiles or the catholic church or football coaches or celebrities you know we had
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:14.720]  the hashtag me too nobody then said muslim men rape too you're allowed to discuss that and you're
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:20.160]  allowed to talk about it nobody then says muslim men do it too just seems to be when we talk about
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:26.240]  muslims you're not allowed to well that's it we were just putting articles on screen the new york
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:31.440]  times put it in paragraph 12 that it was a gang of muslim men that just stabbed an old woman to death
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:36.880]  by the eivill tower they will not say it they fire police chiefs that admit that 90 plus percent of
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:43.200]  it is islamic it is true that uh some of the other gangs are now picking it up uh because no one
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:48.560]  ever put up with this treatment of women i mean you know these type of crimes germany headmaster
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:55.360]  tells mother of daughter bullied by muslims to cover up her face with a hijab so she doesn't get
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:01.520]  beat up or raped that's on info wars dot com islamic group asking us residents if they're american
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:08.080]  citizens is white supremacy that's care new york times waits 12 paragraphs before noting suspect
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:17.040]  in jewish woman's murder is of north african origin and it just goes on and on and on why do you
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:24.880]  think the left is so allied with the most radical forms of islam no idea honestly
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:34.000]  um i think they're just they're brainwashed you know we see it here in the uk so my little
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:40.960]  girl is at primary school she's 10 years old um and they'll talk at school that islam is a religion
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:50.640]  of peace and it's just a really small minority that that gives islam a bad name um so you know
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:56.640]  my daughter's not she's not silly she knows mum's an ex muslim and it's punishable by day
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:05.840]  so they're they're taught in primary school that it's it's peaceful they don't question it unless
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:10.480]  they have people like me or they you know they love people just don't question it people are
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:16.480]  quite happy to live their life in a bubble live for the weekends whether it's to watch their reality
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:23.040]  tv's or to go out drinking socializing well that's it the west has been so open and so free
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:26.640]  and we're so free we're always trying to be better that we automatically think something
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:32.000]  outside must be good and pure and then it comes in and it's like a virus we're not used to and it
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:39.280]  wipes us out i mean i think that's what this is but the global we just want to talk from primary
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:44.800]  school and then going to high school and being given the same message and then going to university
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:51.200]  and still being taught the same message and then you know they become adults and you see it you see
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:57.680]  it in social media you see white people that have no idea of what islam is like they've never
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:03.120]  experienced that they might have some nice muslim neighbors you know it's not to say all muslim people
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:09.760]  are bad no but it's true but they're using white guilt to then have westerners accept any form of
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:14.320]  criminality or bizarre behavior because we don't want to send them just like they knew in some
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:20.000]  towns four thousand girls recruited uh dozens being killed uh and the police would do nothing
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:24.560]  because it was brown men grabbing little girls and and that's what this comes down to
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:32.880]  yep i think they it's been going on since they arrived in the 60s they didn't make up one day in
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:38.400]  1986 and decided to rape white girls it's been going on since their arrival and they just don't
[1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:42.720]  know how to deal with it you know rochdale is one of the towns as well i've just interviewed
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:50.480]  um one of the dads from rochdale for all news media and it's still going on rochdale is known
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:57.520]  the world over for all the wrong reasons and it hasn't it's not stopped the girls are still
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:02.400]  being groomed the girls are still being raped and if you if you were to reverse that you know and
[1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:08.160]  if it was muslim girls and it was gangs of christian men grooming and raping them
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:14.880]  um britain would be on fire they would be rioting so it's it's not just that it's the brown man
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:19.920]  that's doing it there's a fear there's when saltman rush to wrote his book and they rioted
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:24.800]  and they burnt his book and you know the army should have been brought in and these men should
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:28.240]  have been arrested well we gotta go to break but i want to do five more minutes with you talk about
[1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:32.640]  solutions and ideas and i want to be clear i don't want to just blame muslims for this because
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:35.920]  there's been periods in islam or it wasn't like this in some areas where they've not done this
[1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:40.960]  there is the pedophilia at the top of the british government that loves this and i think
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:46.640]  that's the alliance is that a lot of these police departments and other groups that's come out
[1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:50.640]  are like that the radical muslims are there because it's giving them cover and we know
[1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:55.280]  that a lot of people in the uk are working with the muslims and going and having sex with these
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:52:05.840]  girls as well so that's what this is the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones
[1:52:05.840 --> 1:52:28.480]  show if you go to drudge report dot com the number one website in the world it's independent
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:41.680]  patriot you will notice that bezos faces trumps wrath drops 40 plus billion today and it's still
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:47.440]  dropping i've got some of the latest stock market numbers we're going to get to uh here in a few
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:54.160]  minutes uh bezos did special deals with bill clinton and then obama where he gets $1.48 on
[1:52:54.160 --> 1:52:59.040]  every package he gets a bunch of other stuff that's free he has to keep his money offshore and he
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:04.960]  funds the washington post that calls me a snake oil salesman is trying to shut down info wars
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:11.440]  for selling supplements 18 of our supplements are brand named for amazon and are their best
[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:17.600]  sellers and are excellent by the way and we sell them for less so it's just a show with a fraud
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:23.200]  bezos is i'm not tax exempt i don't get a dollar 48 on every package like he does i don't and then
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:27.120]  and then he's got the washington post trying to shut us down trying to harass us and shut down
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:33.040]  info wars trying to take our free speech and he's selling the exact same stuff i mean just
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:42.080]  he's a criminal in my view and so i said this two weeks ago from my white house sources who
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:45.520]  are just mid-level but they heard it that alex don't worry
[1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:52.400]  god i was told don't worry about john mccain he was diagnosed with brain cancer two weeks later
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:58.480]  and i'm not laughing about that the point is it just gets crazy and i was told you don't worry about
[1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:03.920]  google and facebook and twitter just watch what happens to amazon that was a couple months ago
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:11.040]  and then i've been sitting back and now boy we're seeing an army so let's show drudgerport.com's
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:20.800]  front page amazon faces the wrath of trump stocks plunge we're gonna tell you the inside baseball
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:30.880]  on that but i mean look bezos was given a chance he's had four meetings with trump that we know of
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:37.200]  and he won't stop he won't stop trying to overthrow the country in the first amendment and
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:45.440]  so okay you get what you want brother you get it now don't you it'll take you to zero if we have to
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:55.680]  i have to say i am enjoying this though because bezos is the worst i don't know zuckerberg
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:00.880]  gosh he has zuckerberg thought they'd put out that analytical story that would
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:05.040]  not let conservatives have access to databases and out blow up their face these guys just aren't
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:12.320]  as smart as they think they are yeah trump hates amazon not facebook that's right because he knows
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:18.960]  who's in his business let me tell you something zuckerberg's got problems but notice i harp on
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:28.720]  bezos all day because bezos is the problem he's the jerk and he's the guy funding the leftist
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:35.120]  cia the breakaway groups i mean he's lucky he's lucky he's not in the orange jumpsuit right now
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:41.600]  because he is an arrogant cuss have you ever seen him he stopped the ticket he used to have
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:49.040]  these earlier interviews wrinkles this goofy thing he does everywhere and it's a total cover for a
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:59.440]  flaming psychopath in my opinion so you keep doing your stuff busy i mean why would you take
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:06.480]  on an american recovery he could get even richer in this he doesn't care so going back to our guest
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:13.920]  shazia hobs uh leading the worldwide movement to stop general mutilation of women under islam
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:18.240]  we're getting into the grooming we're getting into even one in telegraph says it's a national
[1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:22.320]  security issue that the royal family and always elites have been caught connecting to pedophilia
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:28.080]  and i think that's why they're so outlive of the worst elements of islam there's a lot of
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:32.160]  countries you know that weren't doing this they're women they're islamic just because it's a smoke
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:37.840]  screen and a kind of mainlining and a creating a system of little girls that that the that the
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:43.120]  pedophiles who aren't islamic can come be part of i think that's what's going on any other key
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:48.320]  points you want to make we salute you miss hobs for the work you do and everything you do in your
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:52.720]  courage know you get death threats you've been banned on twitter before any other key points you
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:57:01.360]  want to make and how do how do people support the work you're doing i don't ask for any any
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:09.680]  any money or anything like that i just think speak out if you see it if you see you know
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:16.720]  young girls because we know that they they target them outside kebab shops that's like one of the
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:23.280]  the places kebab workers taxi drivers and if you see something and you think it's it doesn't look
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:32.800]  right you know young girls they're usually 12 13 14 hanging about with older men pakistani men
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:42.560]  muslim men white men you know report it do something don't just ignore it yeah they're just setting up
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:50.960]  the same harems they always do i mean you know i mean mom had had a nine-year-old in his harem
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:56.800]  and that's liberal does that mean lord was down him likes that i guess okay i think you know what
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:58:03.600]  we were talking about earlier as well before the break that the law is right at the top so it starts
[1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:11.200]  right at the top with our elite the british elite you know whether it's your politicians lawyers
[1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:21.840]  judges they're very high up um they rape children white men and it goes right down to the bottom
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:29.840]  and it goes on to the online street grooming with the pakistani muslim men and it just you know how
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:38.480]  do we stop it how it's been allowed to go on for so long and i think that we need to hold to account
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:44.560]  all of the children's safeguarding agencies the police you know it's the more we hear about the
[1:58:44.560 --> 1:58:49.920]  rape gangs and the more we hear you know that the police were involved as well so police are
[1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:59.840]  cropped police are cropped the world over and i think you know we just need to revamp it's like
[1:58:59.840 --> 1:59:06.160]  just user down in america draining the swamp and we need to get rid of all every single person that
[1:59:06.160 --> 1:59:11.440]  failed children in the uk and these rape gangs social workers the police right we need to drain
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:17.040]  the pedophile swamp beautifully said well please join us again if you're ever in austin i hear you're

[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:38.800]  and i'm not arrogant i don't know if i'm personally going to win this but see it's not about me
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:45.600]  personally winning i realize this injustice is going on and i realized the only reason i grew up
[2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:50.880]  somewhat free was because my forebearers were tough and didn't get pushed around and stood up for
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:57.360]  decency and all the michael moors and all the glorious times everybody else has been covering
[2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:04.560]  up all this crap you better know this i know your trash i know your filth i know you're totally
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:09.120]  fake psychopathic people that have written off humanity and think this is all cute and funny
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:15.280]  i'm sick of you moralizing and grandstanding about how you care about everybody when everything you
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:22.320]  do is pure stinking garbage john i just want you to know bill clinton hillary clinton the
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:28.400]  globalist michael moore lord roth child the rockfellers all of listen up you hate everybody

[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:39.520]  depopulate i got an idea how about you slit your own throat or jam some ice picks in your own eyes

[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:58.720]  welcome back alex jones here broadcasting world mind your calls coming up
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:06.480]  i'm gonna call us into the next hour but i cannot believe the incredible white house information i'm
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:14.560]  given and it's just it's just been dead on accurate in fact i meant to mention this earlier
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:23.200]  before i get into bezos and the fact that they're 40 billion down and axios breaks it down that he
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:29.040]  sees bezos as his enemy who opposes a political weapon he knows bezos is funding leftist groups
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:34.000]  well yeah bezos is probably behind the scenes doing more funding than soros right now and just
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:38.480]  because he does that whole fake nice guy act just does one eye doesn't point the right direction
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:45.360]  like a little magic trick doesn't mean we gotta roll over to bezos america built you boy and now
[2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:51.600]  you're getting all this free tax money all this stuff it's the end of the road and this is definitely
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:03:01.520]  a message to google and facebook and everybody else so notice everything you guys does everything
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:05.440]  you do blows up in your face like oh we're gonna ban the second amendment like three days later
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:12.480]  we didn't mean that stop oh my we're down 10 points of the polls are more america doesn't like you
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:15.680]  i don't like you either

[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:32.160]  just stop it but see america's the big bear or the moosh that the hunters want to mount it's
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:38.080]  like the elephant if we could just get america and run it we'd stop trying to run it love it
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:46.320]  turn it loose ride it ride it like trump wants to do don't try to get a tiger by the tail
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:51.680]  i've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:57.280]  there won't be much left to me when you're a few me
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:03.440]  now let's get serious here because i want to hit this and then move on to your calls
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:08.800]  we are at a historic crossroads
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:16.160]  and it's up to all of us to stay politically active and not let their intimidation get to us
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:21.920]  people go well if i speak out i'll get sued like you or i'll get demonized we're not trying
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:30.480]  to personally always worry about ourselves because if we don't stop worrying we will lose
[2:04:30.480 --> 2:04:35.840]  everything you never figure that out see it's a paradox of my extreme selfishness
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:42.880]  acting like cowards and rolling over to any pressure is what creates slavery
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:50.080]  it's what creates entropy it's what creates stagnation it's what creates venezuela or north
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:59.360]  korea you don't want that you want real change you want real debate you want real diversity
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:04.560]  globalism is not diversity it's centralized brainwashing and a bunch of groups played off against
[2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:13.280]  each other and so it's a process and we've got jeff bezos
[2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:24.000]  waging a war against free speech waging a war against america waging a war against our recovery
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:29.680]  you've got loy blank flying at golden sacks notice he's out he was tweeting six months ago america
[2:05:29.680 --> 2:05:35.600]  will never recover and laughing i'm surprised he didn't get cement shoes for that type of stuff
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:40.800]  and i'm not into that but i mean when you're trying to destroy a country and betting against it with
[2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:45.680]  a chinese communist who don't care about their people and sell christians organs you've signed
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:51.600]  on to some evil stuff so i'm not going to cry behind the barn at night if something happens to you
[2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:58.880]  and i'm not threatening anybody i'm saying you guys don't get that a free country gives you an
[2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:04.000]  atmosphere to be free and do stuff and that getting rid of the atmosphere because you
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:10.640]  want to dominate people a short term it will end up eating you in the end people have chivalry
[2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:15.200]  because they didn't want their wives and children being targeted you guys go let's just get rid of
[2:06:15.200 --> 2:06:21.200]  chivalry and start targeting people's wives and children until it happens to you idiot what you
[2:06:21.200 --> 2:06:27.360]  don't think we don't know how to go after your wives and children or that we're scared to you moron
[2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:33.920]  you idiot we have rules it's called civilization fool
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:41.600]  because if men want to kill each other for power that's one thing but why not
[2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:46.960]  leave the infrastructure let's say you got an anti-human bent so you like you don't like
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:52.000]  seeing infrastructure because you don't like competition people like bezos sees you're good
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  looking wife you're good looking husband you're nice family you're upwardly mobile you don't
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:03.840]  need him and he feels bad he wants to run you he wants to break you because he's a fallen bad person
[2:07:05.760 --> 2:07:12.000]  he is a piece of crap he is cancer so is zuckerberg so are these other people
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.920]  and they got to be dealt with and dealt with strongly
[2:07:19.200 --> 2:07:23.920]  so you want to fight better believe you got one jackasses and if you don't think
[2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:28.480]  trump doesn't have a bunch of other stuff of his sleeve that's why they've been so scared
[2:07:29.440 --> 2:07:34.320]  he just tried to get him to roll over and become even richer and be they don't want you to have
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:40.960]  any of the money all these globalists want you poor they they they don't want to share any of it
[2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:45.840]  they don't think your wealth makes them richer they're idiots they fundamentally are missing
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:53.040]  something which allows them to get into positions of power but just like again cancer can take over
[2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:59.680]  the body because it isn't in symbiosis it isn't working with everybody else it isn't 360 it isn't
[2:07:59.680 --> 2:08:05.760]  non-zero some game it's not harmonic it's not connected it's not balanced it's bad it's evil
[2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:13.920]  it's filthy it smells it doesn't work it brings you failure of the general species and everything
[2:08:13.920 --> 2:08:23.440]  around us like china so trump hates amazon not facebook no he's just going after facebook later
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:33.520]  oh axios they knew that political was discredited so now they're axios oh it doesn't sound
[2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:41.600]  establishment it's axios they're gonna tell me how it works oh axios tell me do you remember
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:52.320]  on march 8 to got published on march 9 that is uh almost three weeks ago i said i talked to sources
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  and that kim jong-un already agreed to the framework of giving up the nukes and everything
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:59.920]  else before trump even agrees to meet with him that may mean he still may try to back out but
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:08.560]  they already have an agreement before this happened what was then announced today c nbc china
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:13.840]  claims kim jong-un has agreed to denuclearize korean peninsula and has already agreed to all
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:19.120]  of the request but they want an economic package and a plan to merge the north and south
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:24.880]  in the next 10 years you got the news three weeks before because i got it directly because
[2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:30.960]  they know we're under attack and we get little pieces of news so that folks don't know we're for
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:38.880]  real so next week's next month's news today here's a clip from back in march 9th it's on info wars
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:45.360]  dot com where we laid it all out for you and now it's all confirmed here it is so here's the statement
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:52.240]  kim jong-un has already tactically agreed to the terms of the trump meeting trump's not gonna go
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:57.520]  to that meeting without getting an agreement and without having a meeting i'm glad he's not going
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:02.080]  to go there and not have the victory okay so i'm going to explain this the meeting already happened
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:10.000]  last week after all the diplomatic and military pressure and you heard it here first you'll you'll
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:15.520]  guarantee the month or so after this happens it's going to come out that trump already has the
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:18.800]  agreement now does that mean kim jong-un might not try to back out or do something

[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:17.440]  good to talk to you um i'm from Omaha um and i would like to put a challenge out to all the
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:22.880]  women patriots out there if you are in a state where you can open carry your handgun you need to
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:29.440]  open carry that handgun as a woman i cannot tell you how many times i have had other women come up
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:35.280]  to me and say hey how are you allowed to do that exactly they've created with with hollywood like
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:40.800]  everything based in new york or whatever or guns are banned and by openly uh doing it it's one of
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:49.840]  the most revolutionary things you can do exactly and um i mean i had one conversation with a woman
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:55.200]  and she was just curious she said well why don't you conceal that why don't you have it under your
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:00.720]  coat and i said well let me ask you this i said if you and i were to walk out in the parking lot
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.000]  right now and there was a psycho nut job in the parking lot that was looking for a woman to kidnap
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:11.920]  and rape out of the two of us who do you think he's going to pick and there was this long pause
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:17.600]  and you could almost hear the click in her brain and she said well it's not going to be you and i
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:24.480]  said exactly i only need to be a harder target than one other person that's why we have to get the
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:30.640]  position of it's not just carrying a gun openly you gotta worry about it's the nut job it's always
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:35.440]  some nut job on drugs it's always some nut job the police knew about when it couldn't bust it's all
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:42.480]  it's always a stand down and it's the same story but absolutely i feel good at an open carry march i
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:48.480]  feel good and statistically it's come out now we've got what 25 years it can still carry or more
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:55.360]  starting in florida in other areas crime drops 30 40 percent within a few years and concealed carry
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:58.640]  owners because people are all about honor and they're the type that actually go and do it
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:04.160]  but they have the lowest crime rate of any group no matter what color they are the lowest crime
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:11.920]  rate is concealed carry that is a fact exactly good people outnumber bad people 99 to 1 and it's
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:17.360]  time for us to get that and with little piglet hog and all the rest of these people get up there as
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.640]  public figures want to take my free speech when i criticize them to hell with them and they trying
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:29.200]  to project on me it's like i own a Ford truck well i know one of these jihadis in europe used a
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:34.480]  Ford truck to run people over if somebody called me up said alex you got a Ford truck and this jihadi
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:41.200]  just ran over 100 people i'd say are you joking i mean again louisville slugger still hundreds of
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:47.360]  people here if i got a louisville slugger which i do being my son at baseball's backyard is that
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:54.480]  louisville slugger's fault what's the answer uh deborah no absolutely not absolutely not our again
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:16:00.000]  are we going to blame spoons for making people fat are you going to blame the pencil for making the
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:06.720]  you know mistakes seriously come on but as a woman open carrying a gun that opens up the
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:12.480]  conversation to other women a woman is not going to i totally agree i totally agree women need to
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:17.120]  do it and here's the thing they act like men are trying to suppress women as a father of three girls
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:21.920]  nothing i love it when my girls want to take jiu jitsu i love it when they go daddy i want to go
[2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:28.640]  shoot and i love that i love that that is an instinct i want my girls as beautiful smart and as mean as
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:37.600]  they can be absolutely i had talked to one girl she came up to me and she goes well i have a
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:42.480]  restraining order i'm like baby that that's just piece of paper it is not going to stop a gun or
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:47.440]  knife you need to get a gun i said do you have a gun and she goes no i'm like why don't you have a gun
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:51.760]  she goes well i don't know how to get one so i spent 30 minutes explaining to her beautiful here's
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:55.840]  how you get your purchase permit here's how you get a concealed carry here's where you can take
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:01.840]  classes you know you need to protect yourself because the police are not going to get there
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:05.840]  and i'm not hitting on you deborah but this is really sexy a woman going to teach other women
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:10.720]  how to use guns and that the left came out this weekend on news and said telling someone about
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:18.080]  guns is harassment so they don't want us communicating you're exactly right well and think about if
[2:17:18.880 --> 2:17:28.640]  all the women patriots out there were to open
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:40.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:47.520]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones you know the motto of the special earth
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:54.000]  services in the uk the model of special forces around the world today it's fortune favors the bold
[2:17:54.800 --> 2:18:00.400]  there's another saying nobody knows who said it posthumously but no guts no glory well i'm not
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:04.880]  looking for red carpets i'm not looking for jet airplanes i'm not looking for people to kiss my
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:12.160]  eye old ugly butt but what i am looking for is living my own life and all these control freaks
[2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:18.240]  and people that want to run my life want to run your life i say it's open season on them
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:24.080]  intellectually culturally economically and if they jump across that line and they pull the first
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:31.040]  punch and they draw the first blood then we give them everything they want and it'll just be like
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:39.040]  like rowing a boat up and down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream
[2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:45.120]  because the tree of liberty is watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants and
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:49.920]  as strong as the enemy is
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:56.960]  they're only strong in their will to be evil we are strong in our will to be just
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:01.680]  and we're building a future world now we we're at that break and bumper music didn't fire it's
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:06.800]  fine sorry i cut you off ma'am uh debra finishing your point absolutely what you're saying is what
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:11.920]  might judge and i tell the story because i'm just so busy just like four years ago

[2:19:58.960 --> 2:20:03.760]  story and he said this is how i convert him greater king of the hill be with some butter all that
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:08.000]  stuff it's one of the biggest producers ever he's been like seven billion dollars in production
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:11.760]  it's almost as big a spill bird but the point is he's a very humble guy you know he was the
[2:20:11.760 --> 2:20:20.640]  top engineer on the f 18 he made money off that almost 30 years ago and left with that money and
[2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:25.920]  set up what he really wanted to do animations that's how smart my judge is anyways i'm not trying
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:30.400]  to kiss my judge but like photogenically he kind of looks like a nerd on photos but in person he
[2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:35.600]  looks like brisk willis but anyways and nothing makes the girls more excited too i mean you know
[2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:40.320]  i was in the middle of a divorce then so i was a good boy let me tell you but you know you get
[2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:44.240]  out there with the girls shoot some guns and have some beer and eat some barbecue out in the country
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:52.160]  it's a good night so that conversion of those people in in in 30 minutes each time that we did
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:57.600]  it was incredible and so that's exactly what debba was saying but a lot of women are kind of creeped
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:05.600]  out by men and i don't blame them i'm creeped out by men and and and so we need to have you go out
[2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:11.120]  and basically show the religion of self-defense and self-empowerment and there's nothing more
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:18.480]  human than that than not being a victim is that what you're saying debba exactly exactly um
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:25.440]  you know i i feel very safe when i'm carrying my gun because i'm like five foot nothing
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:33.040]  weigh about 120 so i'm i'm a little person um and to be out at night it's very empowering to
[2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:39.040]  have my gun and have people know that i have my gun i mean i was walking to my car one night and two
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:44.640]  guys came up and they saw me and they're kind of you know joking with with each other going hey
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:48.640]  she's got a gun we're not going to mess with her i'm like yeah that's a good plan you better keep
[2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:59.200]  walking um so that gun is the equalizer for women plain and simple yeah and if and then the feminists
[2:21:59.200 --> 2:22:04.960]  run around say take guns from women is the most asinine load of baloney i've ever heard in my life
[2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:09.200]  and i just tell you the funnest thing is here in my older daughter say daddy daddy
[2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:13.520]  i want to go shooting some more and you know i'm sitting back in the backyard shooting bows and
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:20.640]  arrows and BB guns and it's just the best thing on earth and how the left each generation gets more
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:24.480]  domesticated thank you so much debber great points god bless you and by the way she held for an
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:29.280]  over an hour and a half so get her get her name and number uh and let's send her a free t-shirt or
[2:22:29.280 --> 2:22:33.920]  something because that's what we're doing here let's bring roger stone in here and we'll continue
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:40.400]  with phone calls as he wants to take calls roger i remember talking to another source in congress
[2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:50.240]  about month ago and he said alex trust trump um i had just talked to ted newgent and he had said
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:53.760]  talked about some private meetings and i'll leave with that he said you want to talk to this person
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:56.880]  and i'd never talked to this individual before about who they were and i talked to him it was an
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:01.120]  off record meeting and they said listen trumps for real he's suckering them on the guns he just
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:04.640]  wants them to come out and be anti-gun and say they want to ban the second amendment and i remember
[2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:10.240]  those conversations with newgent and others and then it happens a month later and i'm going okay
[2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:16.000]  i don't want to put like some mammal on trump of like 40 chests but now i'm starting to buy that and
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:25.440]  then i was told by another source hey don't worry he's going after bezos first because the washington
[2:23:25.440 --> 2:23:28.880]  posts and how he's getting all this free tax money and everything and trump just thinks it's bad
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:34.800]  anyways the facebook was getting tax money he'd do it too but they're not and now it's all here
[2:23:34.800 --> 2:23:41.680]  i mean wow uh this is incredible so so what can you say about his gun move going okay give us what
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:47.120]  you want and they okay we want to ban the guns and people go oh my god i mean i was told that
[2:23:47.120 --> 2:23:51.200]  trump was in meetings and said watch what i'm going to do and don't get on my ass when i do it
[2:23:51.200 --> 2:23:55.120]  and you see him in that meeting with feinstein a month ago and the republics are kind of nodding
[2:23:55.120 --> 2:24:00.560]  and smiling because and then and then i'm told like you can go ahead and even tell people because
[2:24:00.560 --> 2:24:05.120]  the left's so delusional they don't even listen to us but i mean i just i'm not mackey of ellie
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:09.200]  roger you know i'm like straight up and that's my strength it's all my also my weakness but
[2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:14.480]  jeez you know trump well is that really what's going on here what i think is going on is the
[2:24:14.480 --> 2:24:19.840]  the media is getting some rhetoric but the nr a is getting the legislation looked out of
[2:24:19.840 --> 2:24:25.040]  trump and the republicans stand no chance whatsoever in the next two elections without the
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:30.880]  active support of the greatest grassroots political organization probably left in the country
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:36.480]  the national rifle association no i agree but is he really happy playing him because i was told
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:40.880]  he's playing him by dead new jen and a congressman i think they're both absolutely right alex i
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:46.000]  think the president is playing him we can count on him on the second amendment look i think this
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:52.240]  has to be seen within a larger context stormy daniels getting no traction with the american people
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:58.240]  at all despite it all out from trump's approval went up what uh and you can see why among many
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:05.280]  men that's entirely possible uh at the same time the real explanation is doubling a hundred percent
[2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:14.560]  increase in the gdp over barack obama we had three percent gdp when obama at best averaged 1.5
[2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:19.280]  and we were told that's what we could expect so that's a hundred percent increase and the american
[2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:25.360]  people feel it they they're beginning to feel it now with the prospect of real peace uh and a
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:31.520]  settlement of this north korean menace and a madman who we believe may have the capacity to
[2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:39.840]  destroy us trump is on the verge of true greatness when he when he threatened a little uh dictator uh
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:45.440]  you know he was accused of being bellicose and it was dangerous but it threatened them to the
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:52.160]  table of skillful diplomacy nick trump does not want war now the question most people
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:57.920]  have asked me alex is what about this spending deal because let's face it it stinks uh there's
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:03.760]  so much in there that's just garbage chuck schumer gets millions for a tunnel we get nothing to build
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:08.640]  the wall uh there's a lot of things wrong with it but i think the president tells us in his own
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:15.200]  words and it's both strategically important to understand by giving the military buildup that
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:20.720]  not only trump is promised but which the generals want he's buying the allegiance of our military
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:27.840]  and what could be a coming constitutional showdown uh and for that reason plus keeping his his
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:34.080]  faith with and his support for rebuilding our muscle uh he's delivered uh for the military
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:41.520]  hopefully peeling them off from some of their intelligence neocon allies is this a chess move
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:48.000]  i think so and he accepts all the crap that he doesn't like because he has now got the generals
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:54.720]  we know he has the first non-civilian secretary of defense in memory i really think alex that's
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:27:00.240]  what's going on we'll talk about it more calls straight ahead with roger stone all i know is
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:04.640]  trump's gotten a 5 10 15 20 point boost depending on the poll
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:08.320]  once the democrats said we're gonna ban the guns i mean they did get
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:26.080]  shucked in and i love watching hog and all the rest of them fall flat on their anti-gun little fascist faces
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:30.080]  you
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:39.120]  alex jones here back live you know i was saying i was going to give all the callers
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.320]  free t-shirts for holding over an hour and a half but i was going to keep them on so i'm sorry
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:46.000]  i didn't communicate so we're going to open the phones back up was roger wants to take calls
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:52.880]  for the callers that were already on they can get back in our new callers 877789 alex 8777892539
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:58.400]  we're going to get to you coming up here uh you know roseanne barb i'm a big john goodman fan
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:03.200]  i was not a big tv fan in my life but i did watch that show 25 30 years ago and was on
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:09.200]  but she's been on the show six seven eight years ago she came on four or five times she's a listener
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:13.600]  that you can even say roseanne barb kind of woke up from the show she said that on air and i haven't
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:17.200]  been in contact with her for years we tweeted at her today she said she wants to come on
[2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:21.120]  so ted newton's on tomorrow and a bunch of other exclusive stuff who knows roseanne barb looks like
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:28.880]  maybe on tomorrow but what's interesting is top rated shows on abc cbs nbc now about six seven million
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:33.600]  back at their heyday they had like 30 million people are sick of the propaganda they just
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:40.320]  premiered her show with double the ratings that abc gets another top shows 18 million in the main
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:47.840]  demo something like 30 million total that's one in four wars dot com and the show is just a little
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:53.280]  pro trump and shows both sides kind of an archie bunker deal where there's both sides that's how
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:59.520]  hungry america is to just not be beat over the head what does that say to you rogers don't
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:05.680]  i know you know roseanne as well uh you know she's a woman of enormous class and style she's uh
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:12.960]  upgraded her look extraordinarily she ended up on my best dressed list and she deserves it she's uh
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:19.520]  has to take the brick bats of liberal hollywood for having an alternative view that is not politically
[2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:25.760]  correct but because of her talent and because of her fame based on the great success of the show
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:32.800]  in its first run she has some leverage i had asked her to be on the alex jones show last year
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:39.920]  she was very kind she is indeed a viewer uh and she is certainly a patriot and i think
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:46.160]  privately a supporter of the president uh and she was most gracious so i'm delighted to see
[2:29:46.160 --> 2:29:52.160]  the extraordinary success for a woman of great class and i think uh well sure but i mean she
[2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:57.760]  went on national television uh and then said last week she supported trump
[2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:03.360]  yeah i know i think but she i she's not wearing on her sleeve that's not the point of the show
[2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:08.720]  no no sure they bring it up and then she says yeah yeah okay yeah he's pro america i mean yeah
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:14.320]  yeah it's refreshing it's refreshing you don't see it out of anything created in hollywood she's
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:18.640]  only able to get away with it because she's a deservedly she's a star i was about to say
[2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:25.360]  she's really funny the point is is that since when in america can't you support the republican
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:30.240]  president or you're a damn demon you know they've got all these videos saying trump's a nazi you're
[2:30:30.240 --> 2:30:36.160]  a nazi i'm a nazi we put a video out paralleling youth marches and gun control and all this to
[2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:42.320]  hitler and the media is calling for us to be banned how how how asinine is that i mean like
[2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:47.600]  sarah silverman can dress up like hitler and go on go on co-bear and say she supports trump
[2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:53.680]  but i am i've ordered a hitler uniform and i'm going to wear it and i'm going to endorse salary
[2:30:53.680 --> 2:30:58.720]  and i'm going to endorse david hog and i'm going to endorse michael more and i'm going to endorse
[2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:04.320]  gun control and i'm going to endorse the democratic party i wonder what they're going to do when i do
[2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:10.560]  it roger uh oh then it would be the worst thing of all time look a double standard among our
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:17.680]  liberal friends oh my goodness who's ever seen that look the elitists the globalists they i don't
[2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:23.120]  think they take any of the movement seriously and that's to their detriment that's how president
[2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:31.520]  trump got elected but the the elites i think are making an enormous mistake is attack on guns
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:38.000]  interestingly enough is the one thing that allows trump to transcend the republican base i was about
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:42.720]  to say i was about to say coming out and saying repeal the second amendment former supreme court
[2:31:42.720 --> 2:31:48.080]  justice is everywhere and then come on saying they never said it what is their problem i mean this
[2:31:48.080 --> 2:31:53.200]  was the one thing that could wake up the sleeping giant i mean this exactly why did they do that
[2:31:54.080 --> 2:32:00.720]  blue collar democrats who don't like republicans but love this country union democrats working class
[2:32:00.720 --> 2:32:07.280]  people who normally aren't touched by the republican country clubs set are riled over this issue they
[2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:13.280]  have awakened the sleeping giant the nra is the finest oil political machine in the country when
[2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:18.720]  it comes to elections republicans who are already conceding the house and running like the the lily
[2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:24.880]  livered cowards for the tall grass from this president are making an enormous mistake we have
[2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:30.960]  double the gnp we have i was about to say why is the republican establishment so cowardly so
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:37.360]  addled so stupid when victory is in our hands they are running for the hills because they
[2:32:37.360 --> 2:32:42.480]  answer to the special interests and the special interests who control washington the defense
[2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:50.320]  contractors and the and the and the other grifters within the system the whole swamp complex are so
[2:32:50.320 --> 2:32:55.280]  threatened by the president they're all the cowards they really are a bunch of cowards we
[2:32:55.280 --> 2:33:00.720]  could have the whole world and build a better system and there's all these chicken crabs that
[2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:06.480]  follow east coast not bashing east coast people but east coast global foundations that really have
[2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:10.320]  a heart on for the country because they've always been trying to get control of the country since
[2:33:10.320 --> 2:33:16.080]  robber baron days they don't get it they just go out of the way they get the whole planet move bitch
[2:33:16.080 --> 2:33:21.600]  get out the way get out the way bitch you see them curtains you see me knock them curtains down you
[2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:27.040]  see those headlights who bought them tv's bitch tell me that they don't get it roger what is their
[2:33:27.040 --> 2:33:34.000]  problem uh they are too uh in the for all of the special interests although i must say i'm gonna
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:40.320]  give the devil is due hero of the week senator mitch mcconnell of all people has a bill uh which
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:47.680]  means it will become law he's of a leader to legalize industrial hemp this is an enormous step
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:54.720]  forward no t hc way better than cotton banned for 80 years what is sessions problem i hear he's got
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:34:00.800]  dementia i hear the same thing uh congressman i have spoken to met with him privately for an hour
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:08.080]  or more describe him as adam describe him as delusional describe him as obsessed with marijuana
[2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:15.200]  obsessed with it obsessed with asset well if i'm not gonna bring my part them in jail
[2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:21.120]  that's from biggest problem of sessions question why is why the president doesn't
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:27.680]  discharge mr rozenstein and then discharge of mr sessions which would be the correct order to
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:34.560]  ensure uh that he get an honest and not a non politicized justice department you know i know i
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:38.480]  say i don't want to hear about russia gate but man we got mad at say yeah we blow a bunch of russians
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:43.040]  that will blow more up in syria and they better watch it we're gonna get really tough i mean it is
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:48.160]  like foaming at the mouth meanwhile it's in the news the communist chinese have the codes to all
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:53.600]  the telecoms and the big national database that controls all the phone numbers and our satellites
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:35:00.480]  and i'm just like how did we ever get in this position no i look at the trump administration
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:09.120]  is has moved ahead on offensive weapons for the ucranium forces that the russians vehemently
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:14.480]  object to in the diplomatic process and are very angry about so much for the idea that
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:21.200]  donald trump is in the pocket of latin mere putin we've just dispelled these athletes i really think
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:28.320]  in many cases this russo phobia rhetoric coming from mattis is meant to kind of
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:35.280]  uh bolster that narrative uh for the american people is kind of almost of a a political head
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:42.640]  fake trump is not soft on the russians he knows exactly who they are and what they are when we
[2:35:42.640 --> 2:35:48.000]  come back dueling the signs is now in house arrest at the paraglain embassy they've cut his internet
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:52.720]  off they've got members of the tory thing calling him a worm and stuff are they about to move against
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:56.480]  one of the greatest living heroes out there because with me they try to take my kids and
[2:35:56.480 --> 2:36:01.120]  bankrupt me and everything else but i'm not i'm not locked up the tower the tower of london
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:17.600]  like dueling in the signs he aligns himself with the truth you're listening to alex jones
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:29.280]  listen baby ain't no mountain high ain't no valley low and no river wild enough baby you need me
[2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:37.680]  call break it up no matter where you are no matter how far don't worry baby just call my name i'll
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:42.480]  be there in a hurry you don't thank you mr president for being there in a hurry with
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:47.440]  bezos 40 billion down today and clobbering all the rest of globalists i want to get the phone
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:52.000]  calls the roger stone here so he wants to take your calls chris and newman and a lot of big
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:58.400]  breaking news here but bezos runs the washington post even worse than new york times incredibly
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:03.920]  deceptive he's involved with the leftist he's trying to overthrow the country he's he's tax exempt
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:10.480]  he gets a dollar 48 on every package he's so arrogant and now trump's going after him but
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:19.200]  axios the folks over at politica with their new name to confuse people and act like they're not
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:25.760]  establishment they give us the inside scoop on trump is willing to break up these trust well we
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.720]  know that he's been putting the lawyers in at the federal trade commission to do it i know you
[2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:36.480]  have a lot of sources involved in this but this is exactly what i want to hear this is the cavalry
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:42.640]  uh amazon is an anti-american company facebook is they thought they'd go after this you know
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:48.560]  analytic a company but that only exposed facebook's overall business so what is the word on this
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:55.760]  and i mean how big this is because this is incredible how incredible alex that both bezos
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:38:03.200]  and zuckerberg are in retreat in major major scandals in essence i think they are their motives
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:09.360]  are completely stripped bare the president's uh called this one it was predicted here at info wars
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:16.720]  going after those who are going after him as he begins to understand the entire tech left
[2:38:16.720 --> 2:38:24.880]  strategy of shutting down not only his voice but but firstly our voice which of course is a magnifier
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:32.480]  a megaphone as it were for him i mean they turn down our volume as the only way they can stop this
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:39.600]  president a free vibrant open internet is what allowed the election of don trump it will allow a fair
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:47.760]  2018 election and would be key to a trump reelection without it a bc nbc cnn and the other of a
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:54.240]  motley crew of mainstream media twistered the washington post being the worst this very weak
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:39:01.440]  they uh this past week they fabricated a story about me now as it comes turns out based totally
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:08.800]  on hearsay two people tell the post they told the special prosecutor stone told us he visited
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:14.160]  a size and one of them said i told him that i knew about the contents of the wiki leaks
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:20.160]  disclosures in advance all fabricated for a fake news cycle so i'm with you the washington post
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:26.880]  is the worst of the worst bezos is uh is a fish-faced enemy of this uh administration and trump
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:33.440]  is taking off the gloves alex there's an excellent article on the daily caller that's uh you know
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:38.800]  deals with how google is is and the other tech companies are openly in league with the democrats
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:44.160]  and the way they tried to spin it that a mercenary company in the uk that a bunch of people hired
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:49.120]  did some work for bannon so oh they invented data mining and this is how trump stole it
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:54.960]  and then that just like a sweater the string pulled the whole thing open that facebook's
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:40:00.400]  this giant data man mining company they're just idiots they don't realize what they're doing
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:08.400]  no i think that cambridge analytic uh stories have some validity uh these guys are initially
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:15.360]  financed by the mercers they claim to have the new mousetrap when it comes to finite political
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:22.960]  targeting of disgruntled and therefore movable voters uh they really i think don't have the
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:28.240]  sizzle they have a lot of sizzle but their product is found wanting in the ted cruz campaign
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:35.920]  i think they come to the verge of of of a litigation there uh i was rather shocked to hear that in the
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:42.160]  end they got a six million dollar contract but now as we turned out to learn it was to
[2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:49.200]  data mine data uh through the back door of facebook and turn it over to brad pascale and the
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:56.480]  uh digital trump team who and we don't know how or if they used it they said this is a continuing
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:00.960]  mystery the total red red herring canard it's not even one tenth of one percent of the stuff going
[2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:06.000]  on just like russia here it is report facebook founder mark zuckerberg will testify to congress
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:10.720]  here's the article that's excellent how the left turned tech giants into their speech police which
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:16.320]  is all admitted they have all the statements the videos you know prayer university sued over how
[2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:20.720]  they put age restriction on something that shouldn't be well that's their prerogative but when you
[2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:28.240]  have videos by veritas saying our enemies alex jones ban him f rednecks f american flags f veterans
[2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:33.920]  the judges will let that go forward because the tortious interference the racketeering the lawyers
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:38.160]  have all looked at that's why we keep building our cases they're so strong it just keeps getting
[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:44.480]  added in the selective enforcement and banning our video saying we said david hogg is a crisis
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:49.280]  actor and no one died and our video doesn't say that that's the real case and i just want google to
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:56.240]  back off but like you said he starts badmouthing google for its cia connections and it's nasa
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:42:02.960]  satellites and all of its interspatial stuff and i mean we the what i don't get about obama and
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:09.680]  hillary and bezos and zuckerberg is they're so arrogant don't they know trump has them by the
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:14.640]  labos i mean seriously the the way the global is transferred all the power of the executive
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:19.440]  i'm surprised trump hasn't moved stronger already this has got to be freaking them out
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:26.400]  well but alex let's remember the folks at google are dining with the president's son-in-law and his
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:32.560]  daughter uh and their profession their professional swamp creatures with the right lobbyists and
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:38.240]  perhaps they think they can neutralize this administration through obfuscation of what
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:41.920]  they've really been done exactly just because they're clear and present danger and sold out the
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:48.720]  chinese like like like apple uh they're fair game man they need to be wiped out and by that wiped out
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:54.960]  of from their monopoly hey how could you not understand alex the uh financial lucrative nature
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:43:00.720]  of storing all of our foremost secrets and all of our defense knowledge over in china and making
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:05.760]  a quick buck how could you not understand what it well you know as a russian agent i'm mad apple's
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:10.480]  moving and giving the keys and as you said shiny telecoms under obama we're giving the index keys
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:14.720]  to the entire grid to control it we'll bring it down exactly we're such damn russian agents
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:19.680]  we're pissed we just handed the keys over to the chicoms uh it's it's really it's really
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:26.960]  extraordinary uh as you try to follow these things uh zuckerberg having his time in the barrel
[2:43:26.960 --> 2:43:33.120]  about these disclosures at the same time bezos is under attack shows me the president knows
[2:43:33.120 --> 2:43:39.120]  uh uh you know who his friends are and by the way we know the pledge protection team and stuff
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:43.360]  it's not just we i didn't tell you guys i apologize just you get how could be sanders
[2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:47.360]  she had a press conference there about it them coming out and pointing out hey you're all taxpayer
[2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:52.400]  funded hey you're a scam hey you rip people off i mean that's just the beginning of what trump
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:57.840]  can do we can actually pull that money from him but bezos just kills stumbles around with one
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:02.880]  eye looking over here and the other one over there i mean he just doesn't get it man uh and i must
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:10.560]  tell you uh he is as you know owns whole foods they go head to head with us so in the uh nutraceutical
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:17.280]  industry i've used their products i've used the info war products i've paid both prices uh the
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:24.320]  products at info wars are both less expensive and they're of higher quality uh and in my case with
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:30.880]  greater results than the overpriced stuff i bought at a whole foods where i think i was buying a
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:36.160]  filler in some case or other but let's just stand on that it's that bezos has the washington post
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:41.600]  call us snaggle salesman for selling some of the same supplements they sell he's just a jerk
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.800]  man he i don't run around trying to shut down other companies i'm just like what's this thing
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:54.000]  about these ivy league guys that like they just want to f everybody over their their jerks well
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:58.720]  but in this case correction what they're what he really offends him is that we are in the same
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:06.080]  business and our products are superior to his at a better price so he resents our competition
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:12.880]  he puts us down as hucksters for selling vitamins and other all natural uh uh nutraceuticals when
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:20.560]  he himself is doing the same thing it's the classic liberal elitist do not as i uh said do
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:24.240]  do as i said and i agree we're gonna come back and take calls but do you notice how
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:30.640]  they they they call trump hitler you hitler me hitler all this crap we point out youth march

[2:48:33.680 --> 2:48:38.320]  because that's what dick chaney did he took the guns from the pilots on 9 11
[2:48:38.320 --> 2:48:43.760]  that's right you trust the pilot to fly a plane before that a lot of pilots carried guns i didn't
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:47.040]  even know that till it happened they took him away two months before that's a great point
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:50.400]  that's a huge point

[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:15.840]  relinquish our firearms it doesn't matter how many lemmings you got out there on the street

[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:39.280]  mincing words tell us how you really feel look uh the most incredible thing i've seen alex and
[2:49:39.280 --> 2:49:45.840]  gotta be 40 years in american politics is a supreme court justice john paul stevens openly saying
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:50.960]  let's repeal the entire second amendment and a bunch of other dumb sons of bitches why did they
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:56.880]  do that was a major miscalculation well the many americans are saying who is this guy let me tell
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:04.400]  you who he is he is the only supreme court uh appointment of uh gerrard ford the accidental
[2:50:04.400 --> 2:50:11.680]  president who followed nixon ford was a deeply flawed guardian because of course he had at the
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:19.840]  direction of j. edger hoover altered the autopsy records of jfk to move the uh location now we
[2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:25.040]  know he covered up the war commission uh and the new york times reported all of this this is
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:31.600]  not some conspiracy theory this is fact so he was uh and nixon knew this so nixon
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:37.920]  was able to weedle a pardon out of him uh but this is the man who gave us john paul stevens
[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:44.320]  he is a liberal republican he is he was uh no but other ones are saying and how dumb are they
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:49.360]  admitting their real plan i mean this this may have killed the blue wave but think about this
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.920]  he's a supreme court justice appointed to the court by a republican who immediately joins
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:51:00.800]  the liberal bloc that wants to take away our guns and our voice it is outrageous and now this
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:05.680]  crypt keeper climbs up from hell to get our guns good luck buddy the doors washington just

[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:03.200]  do it you are the future you are the resistance you are the answer so that's why i do that but
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:08.800]  god bless you i appreciate you it's you not me all of us together my children your children
[2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:13.680]  they're the future and i've just studied history and i don't want to make it about me because
[2:53:14.960 --> 2:53:19.760]  even they'll kill me or they'll lobotomize me and roll me out on tv to say whatever they want
[2:53:19.760 --> 2:53:25.840]  just forget about alex jones just remember we're all in this together that's the secret uh thank you
[2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:31.360]  chris uh but yeah roger i feel america spirit so strong right now i was really depressed yesterday
[2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:35.840]  and paul watson on fair told me said alex our approval ratings are way up conservatives are
[2:53:35.840 --> 2:53:41.280]  way up this backfired stop being so bummed out i just seeing how openly evil they are gets me freaked
[2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:48.080]  out well uh but they are they're stuck in their own uh bullshiff they're trying to resuffle the
[2:53:48.720 --> 2:53:55.280]  public uh the rushing collusion delusion when the public is lost interest our listeners aren't
[2:53:55.280 --> 2:54:01.920]  interested it's been debunked it's nonsense over people now want to focus on the uh fight we're
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:07.040]  having it's completely clear we're the people that want prosperity and guns in america and 57
[2:54:07.040 --> 2:54:12.560]  chevys and maryland and roe get out of exactly this claim that we're the enemy when the globalist
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:20.240]  of the foreign power they're the enemy well uh so i i think they're very much uh uh in retreat uh
[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:27.360]  the the this is why the brazenness of their fake news outlets smearing you smearing me uh
[2:54:27.360 --> 2:54:32.560]  misses the point it's not about us it's about a larger movement to bring this country back
[2:54:32.560 --> 2:54:38.160]  to fundamentals it's about a a clash with and that's why i keep telling the audience support us
[2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:43.840]  that's to do that but don't mentally make it about info or is even me support us yes that's a key
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:50.080]  focal point the power i can feel the power i can see it it's you you have the power i that's what
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:56.240]  i'm trying to tell them is they are the victory no the movement's much larger than any of us
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:55:00.640]  that's why we ask you to go to info or is where we have a donate button now you're not in the
[2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:04.960]  market for one of our great products but you like what we're doing here and you like the way we
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:11.520]  confront the globalists and we lead the war well then send us a generous contribution we don't exactly
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:18.400]  support us and spread the word more than ever but spiritually realize god and and you individually
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:22.320]  with what you're doing in your area you are the vanguard that's all i'm trying to say is
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:29.200]  is that i want to empower people to realize they are the answer there's no question which is why i
[2:55:29.200 --> 2:55:34.880]  tell people the single most important thing you can do as you follow info wars is find the stories
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:40.400]  and videos that you find most compelling that are most important pick up those links and put them out
[2:55:40.400 --> 2:55:48.080]  on your own social media they can strangle us but they cannot strangle all of us and that act and
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:54.480]  and push send and send and paste and paste to mobilize an army of people who think and by the
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:59.680]  way we've been destroying them despite all their ai all right i apologize to all these callers but
