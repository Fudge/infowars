[00:00.000 --> 00:21.240]  It is Wednesday November 27th 2019 I am your host Alex Jones thank you so much for joining
[00:21.240 --> 00:26.640]  us on this Wednesday Worldwide Broadcast and there's a lot of big news obviously breaking
[00:26.640 --> 00:31.920]  today that we're going to be covering throughout the broadcast oh a shroyer is going to be in
[00:31.920 --> 00:37.800]  here hosting much of the broadcast today much of the transmission but I wanted to be here
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.720]  to really look back at some of the news that's broken on the last week because it really
[00:42.720 --> 00:52.000]  crystallizes where the forces of tyranny that want to dominate and control and run society
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  are going and of course I'm talking about total censorship information control and authoritarianism
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.240]  and and what that really means to society because once they get you to follow their politically
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.080]  correct system of language and once you've accepted that they control language under
[01:14.080 --> 01:22.160]  the high priest of language these very very wicked evil people these anti-humans are
[01:22.160 --> 01:28.440]  then able to silence you complaining about glyphosate or roundup or able to silence you
[01:28.440 --> 01:34.520]  talking about GMO or silence you being able to talk about vaccine damage and side effects
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.960]  that are on record in real and they're able just to completely rule society once they
[01:40.960 --> 01:48.360]  stampede everyone in to submission and I have to tell you info wars and this audience of
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.360]  incredible listeners and viewers is seen as the globalist is the main enemy because you
[01:53.360 --> 02:00.200]  get who they are and you're not cowed by their oppression and they're bullying and so they
[02:00.200 --> 02:07.680]  believe if they can take me down off the air and then set me up and imprison me as phase
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.520]  two of that that that's going to intimidate you that that's going to scare you that that's
[02:11.520 --> 02:17.640]  going to silence you well the only way they win is if you get intimidated and if you back
[02:17.640 --> 02:23.680]  down so we really figured out all the angles here and so when we come back from break I
[02:23.680 --> 02:31.440]  want to get into four reports that all tied together I remember Sasha Baron Cohen came
[02:31.440 --> 02:37.080]  out last Thursday and he said arrest the big tech heads that they don't submit to us and
[02:37.080 --> 02:40.800]  let us totally control them after the big tech had already submitted that just shows
[02:40.800 --> 02:46.760]  how the pirates work how the tyrants work the oppressors work then he said we want to
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.840]  totally purge everyone that doesn't agree with us in the name of liberalism of course
[02:50.840 --> 02:59.360]  it's for a good reason according to him and he said we need to ban anyone that talks about
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.320]  replacement migration that he says is a horrible lie and doesn't exist even though it's from
[03:05.320 --> 03:12.840]  the United Nations own website and is still there and is still available for you to see
[03:12.840 --> 03:19.360]  and find out what they said they were going to do in 2001 what became official UN policy
[03:19.360 --> 03:27.800]  in 2003 and what they are now carrying out in mass ladies and gentlemen so this is the
[03:27.800 --> 03:34.200]  big kahuna this is the big enchilada and then that ties into Facebook bands all content
[03:34.200 --> 03:40.000]  on vaccine awareness including facts about vaccine ingredients from their own inserts
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.360]  this is ending all consumer rights this is going back before the jungle was written and
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.880]  you know expose the industrial revolution and some of its bad behavior I mean this is
[03:49.880 --> 03:57.080]  beyond communist China and then that ties into Soros being behind Jeffrey Epstein and
[03:57.080 --> 04:03.680]  being behind the impeachment proceedings against Trump and just who is behind George Soros
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.960]  who looks like he's auditioning on that photo to play the part of an old count Dracula that
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.240]  and more is coming up as we break the code break the matrix and really cut to the heart
[04:14.240 --> 04:20.680]  of exactly what's happening and why they want us off air but please remember it is beyond
[04:20.680 --> 04:25.760]  paramount that you understand how incredible you are and that you understand that you can
[04:25.760 --> 04:30.240]  bypass and override the censors and that you can tell them about the video reports the
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.800]  articles and the information in full wars dot com and news wars dot com and it banned
[04:35.800 --> 04:40.320]  dot video and it pull Watson site summit dot news and that when you get that information
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.360]  out it literally overrides the globalist their programs of enslavement well they're right
[04:44.360 --> 05:00.440]  back on the other side on this live worldwide Wednesday transmission November 27th Beto
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.680]  Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're gonna confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles
[05:05.680 --> 05:11.160]  and he got all the other Democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was
[05:11.160 --> 05:16.240]  a hero think about that now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they
[05:16.240 --> 05:23.040]  control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive
[05:23.040 --> 05:29.000]  drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.800]  for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's
[05:38.800 --> 05:44.640]  under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying their sanctuaries
[05:44.640 --> 05:49.200]  for the Second Amendment and they're gonna follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution
[05:49.200 --> 05:53.560]  and they're not gonna help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities
[05:53.560 --> 06:09.840]  ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws defending
[06:09.840 --> 06:20.760]  the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones my fellow Americans my fellow
[06:20.760 --> 06:26.400]  humans listening and watching across the planet I'm Alex Jones your host on this live Wednesday
[06:26.400 --> 06:33.520]  edition and we are gonna be here for the next four hours Owen shroyer is coming up I'm
[06:33.520 --> 06:38.240]  doing a lot of work behind the scenes here making sure that the First Amendment and our
[06:38.240 --> 06:45.840]  platform continues on into the future even if it is not an info wars dot com incarnation
[06:45.840 --> 06:50.640]  yes ladies and gentlemen free speech is fighting for its life just like all those unborn
[06:50.640 --> 06:55.720]  babies are fighting for their lives and they can't defend themselves they're counting on
[06:55.720 --> 07:00.960]  us to stand up and to protect them and defend them and the reason I mentioned that is coming
[07:00.960 --> 07:06.080]  up next segment and ties into what I'm about to cover now Facebook is announcing they're
[07:06.080 --> 07:11.640]  not gonna allow any pro-life information no humanization of the little babies they're
[07:11.640 --> 07:18.360]  dehumanized that's because that's anti-feminist anti-woman and of course they also are going
[07:18.360 --> 07:23.120]  to cover up all vaccine information including the inserts and so much more this is all been
[07:23.120 --> 07:31.880]  announced so draconian so evil and we see no action from Congress we see no action from
[07:31.880 --> 07:37.920]  President Trump and others this is not about private corporations having their right to
[07:37.920 --> 07:44.400]  their own operations this is about modern communications being seized and AI watching
[07:44.400 --> 07:51.640]  and controlling our every movement and not letting us communicate with each other this
[07:51.640 --> 07:56.360]  is just unspeakable we put up with all the illegal surveillance we put up with them selling
[07:56.360 --> 08:01.120]  our data we put up with microphones and hidden cameras watching and listening to us so why
[08:01.120 --> 08:05.720]  shouldn't we now be told to sit down and shut up hell we put up with killing babies after
[08:05.720 --> 08:11.000]  they're born we let CNN tell us men can have babies and if you don't go along with it we'll
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.120]  arrest you it's all coming up today but let's let's hit this first as it all ties into each
[08:17.120 --> 08:24.080]  other Sasha Barrick Cohen the failed comedian last week at the ADL didn't just say arrest
[08:24.080 --> 08:28.120]  the heads of big tech they don't fully submit to the globalist agenda when they already
[08:28.120 --> 08:36.440]  have capitulated completely willingly he didn't just say a purge free speech online he said
[08:36.440 --> 08:42.920]  that in UK elections trying to get out of Brexit there's a horrible line about replacement
[08:42.920 --> 08:51.080]  migration and it doesn't exist it's a horrible evil conspiracy theory this is what he had
[08:51.080 --> 09:00.120]  to say now British voters will go to the polls while online conspiracies promote the despicable
[09:00.120 --> 09:05.920]  theory of the great replacement that white Christians are being deliberately replaced
[09:05.920 --> 09:13.040]  by Muslim immigrants Americans will vote for president while trolls and bots perpetuate
[09:13.040 --> 09:20.520]  the disgusting lie of a Hispanic invasion and after years of YouTube videos calling
[09:20.520 --> 09:27.880]  climate change a hoax the United States is on track a year from now to formally withdraw
[09:27.880 --> 09:34.600]  from the Paris Accords a sewer of bigotry and vile conspiracy theories that threaten
[09:34.600 --> 09:40.160]  our democracy and to some degree our planet this can't possibly be what the creators
[09:40.160 --> 09:48.880]  of the internet had in mind I but okay so replacement migration doesn't exist there's
[09:48.880 --> 09:57.040]  an article we wrote last year revealed UN plan to flood America was 600 million migrants
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.160]  and there was the borders being knocked down the borders falling the huge caravans pouring
[10:01.160 --> 10:11.880]  in and then we link to the UN report and I'll show you that report right now population
[10:11.880 --> 10:18.840]  division department of economic social affairs United Nations secretariat replacement migration
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.520]  it's a multi-hundred page report I just printed the synopsis the solution declining aging
[10:23.520 --> 10:29.040]  populations as you can see right there just go back to document camp shop please thank
[10:29.040 --> 10:39.240]  you and you can go read the document for yourself and it calls for 600 million to be brought
[10:39.240 --> 10:47.080]  in to the United States in the next 30 years and 250 million to be brought in to Europe
[10:47.080 --> 10:55.040]  in the next 30 years as well and you see you know 600 million is a triple the population
[10:55.040 --> 11:01.440]  that's here in the United States right now roughly so anyone can go to the UN's own
[11:01.440 --> 11:08.640]  website and you can pull up replacement migration population division department of economic
[11:08.640 --> 11:14.360]  and social affairs of the global government but you just heard Sasha Baron Cohen say
[11:14.360 --> 11:18.960]  we need to be silenced for this for this great line of course they're trying to get out of
[11:18.960 --> 11:23.440]  the EU that the UK never voted to enter they just woke up and were under it now 90 plus
[11:23.440 --> 11:29.480]  percent of their laws are made by it now just last week they said in the impeachment hearings
[11:29.480 --> 11:34.160]  that I was a liar and Roger Stone was a liar that Fiona Hill never worked for George Soros
[11:34.160 --> 11:38.800]  even though she was one of the top board members on his main foundation the open society foundation
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.800]  that runs the whole thing and she writes for the globalist the globalist calm and she calls
[11:44.800 --> 11:49.160]  for world government left his policy said none of that's true under oath anyone could
[11:49.160 --> 11:53.120]  just go type in Fiona Hill globalist it's right there but see they'll probably change
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.880]  that now because we're pointing it out to you now now let's shift gears into the subject
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.800]  I was mentioning very powerful article that David Knight covered a lot yesterday but it's
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.360]  so central I'm going to go back to it today to Mike Adams article it's up on info wars
[12:06.360 --> 12:14.240]  dot com Facebook bans all content on vaccine awareness including facts about vaccine ingredients
[12:14.240 --> 12:19.880]  so again first it's Alex Jones then it's a positive mention of Alex Jones and now it's
[12:19.880 --> 12:26.520]  vaccine inserts that by law come with the packaging but the nurses and the people at
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.520]  the clinics don't normally show that to you but you can go there and you can say give
[12:30.520 --> 12:34.720]  me the insert and it looks like Bible paper in fact during the break I'll go grab one
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.200]  I've got one in my office and you open it up and then it says the hundreds of things
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.200]  it'll do to you by law and give you all these neurological disorders narcolepsy Guillain
[12:44.200 --> 12:54.680]  beret epilepsy brain tumors cancer type one diabetes burn your pancreas out on and on
[12:54.680 --> 12:59.720]  and on there's a secret vaccine fund that billions have been paid out of this declassified
[12:59.720 --> 13:05.200]  it's existence the tales are classified since the mid 80s and just all of this but they
[13:05.200 --> 13:11.240]  they tell you that there's just nothing wrong and so as consumers and his mothers and fathers
[13:11.240 --> 13:17.320]  and others they won't show rallies exposing all the damage because it's gone from one
[13:17.320 --> 13:21.880]  in 35,000 having autism to 150 something and it's everywhere and there's TV ads everywhere
[13:21.880 --> 13:26.680]  and they're collecting money for it and sasa bear Cohen's you know families you know a
[13:26.680 --> 13:32.080]  big end to all of that making money off autism treatment seriously looking up one of his
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.520]  brothers and they know it's a hoax Andrew Wakefield you know the doctor he made it
[13:35.520 --> 13:41.480]  all up he didn't make anything up they just say that they just had the major journals
[13:41.480 --> 13:46.120]  come out and say it wasn't true the studies are legion let me show you one of these articles
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.640]  CDC whistleblower we were ordered to cover up vaccine autism link and then there's the
[13:50.640 --> 13:59.320]  whole video from this target dot com and it came out 2001 and 2003 ABC News reported
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.800]  that the head of the CDC in a meeting admitted that given millions of people that I guess
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.040]  what they've taken that off the CDC website now and they've taken down or SV 40 that gives
[14:09.040 --> 14:15.640]  you cancer was in over 100 million dosages of polio shot that they admit gave people
[14:15.640 --> 14:27.000]  that as well this is what's happening ladies and gentlemen and if you read the whole article
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.480]  and we'll come back and get into this it lays out all the admissions where they go pro-life
[14:33.480 --> 14:38.760]  is not going to be allowed you say babies have rights and are humans we call that anti-woman
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.600]  you're not going to be able to talk about GMO glyphosate that will criticize anything
[14:42.600 --> 14:48.040]  this is the whole ruling class power structure spying on all of us taking control of all
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.540]  telecommunications everybody promotes Facebook promotes Twitter promotes Google everybody
[14:52.540 --> 14:56.640]  promotes it to their businesses for 20 years it gets all the traffic and now that they've
[14:56.640 --> 15:01.360]  got us where they want us they pull the rug out from under us and do this that's why it's
[15:01.360 --> 15:05.160]  critical to keep info wars on the air and every other independent outlet because they
[15:05.160 --> 15:10.160]  want to silence you and once info wars is off the air once other sites like this are
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.760]  off the air or bullied into submission they're going to be able to do whatever they want
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.760]  and big tech whether it's Facebook or Google particularly in apple are rushing in right
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.680]  now and buying up at a discount big pharma who wants to merge with them so that they
[15:24.680 --> 15:29.320]  will work together to suppress all of this knowledge and all of this information so
[15:29.320 --> 15:34.160]  information everywhere but it's all the dis info push to the top and the very inserts
[15:34.160 --> 15:39.160]  now they don't want you to read because it confirms what it can do to you all the other
[15:39.160 --> 15:43.240]  drug companies they have to tell you the side effects they don't want to do this they have
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.920]  they're going to put laws the books to ban you from being able to even have the inserts

[19:37.520 --> 19:41.920]  bacteria that causes gensivitis is all proven you can make claims with this but I had to
[19:41.920 --> 19:47.680]  tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses
[19:47.680 --> 19:53.520]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really
[19:53.520 --> 19:57.520]  proud of it it funds the operation info or store dot com and that's why we're still on
[19:57.520 --> 20:11.520]  air thanks to you you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:11.520 --> 20:28.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones and we are back on this wednesday
[20:28.040 --> 20:33.520]  november twenty seven two thousand nineteen global transmission our employer is coming
[20:33.520 --> 20:40.840]  up let me take you back to the article we were reading in a moment about facebook and
[20:40.840 --> 20:45.800]  the rest of big tech now working with big pharma to suppress your speech with a i up
[20:45.800 --> 20:50.320]  front if you try to criticize hey my kid had a seizure when they took the vaccine or hey
[20:50.320 --> 20:54.880]  I got cancer hey my my grandmother got polio from it and told me the doctor told her they
[20:54.880 --> 21:00.160]  will then warn you and then ban your account a giant reeducation camp look at this article
[21:00.160 --> 21:10.880]  from rt uk court bans protest against lgbt curriculum at muslim dominated school that's
[21:10.880 --> 21:19.080]  right the muslims and more power to them don't want literal pedophilia sexualization of children
[21:19.080 --> 21:25.160]  and then teaching their kids there another sex in the whole taba stock institute uk system
[21:25.160 --> 21:31.640]  and so the court has ruled that parents can't protest across the street at the park they're
[21:31.640 --> 21:39.640]  banning protest because it's hurting a protected minority to not let the pedophile run uk government
[21:39.640 --> 21:43.120]  have access to your children they take your tax money they go to public school and they
[21:43.120 --> 21:47.040]  teach them this and and so thank god that you know the muslims have got a lot of issues
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.800]  and a lot of problems but the left has brought the muslims in because they're seen as anti-christian
[21:52.800 --> 21:58.680]  but now the muslims are refusing to go along with this because many muslims are really good
[21:58.680 --> 22:03.440]  people compared to the left that's a fact I just don't like the muslims being brought
[22:03.440 --> 22:06.400]  in and being taught not to assimilate because the left thought they could just cord them
[22:06.400 --> 22:10.440]  off and control them but that's backfiring that's why the globalists are not invincible
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.840]  they're very easy to beat if you just admit wow Fiona Hill's a globalist that hates america
[22:14.840 --> 22:20.760]  she admits it oh you know wow america was never great according to these people wow
[22:20.760 --> 22:26.160]  soros is running a lot of this wow they do want replacement migration they admit it in
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.120]  their own documents they're telling us it doesn't exist they thought they could have
[22:30.120 --> 22:33.400]  this big world government just ignore us and move forward with it but no we're gonna point
[22:33.400 --> 22:37.920]  it out we're never gonna shut up no matter what they do to us so islamic parents stage
[22:37.920 --> 22:42.960]  mass demonstration against pedophile agenda that's their words the high court is permanently
[22:42.960 --> 22:51.680]  banned activists from protesting its lgbt equality lessons oh being taught in school
[22:51.680 --> 22:58.160]  in birmingham england birmingham council won their case on tuesday after taking out an
[22:58.160 --> 23:05.720]  injunction against the protesters in the summer who were demonstrating outside the park school
[23:05.720 --> 23:12.560]  in spark hill the school has witnessed months of protest out the front gates instigated
[23:12.560 --> 23:19.680]  by anti-lgbt campaigners and parents unhappy with the equality lessons being taught their
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.360]  children and men we've gone over these in the uk and the us i mean it is shocking they're
[23:24.360 --> 23:28.800]  teaching five-year-olds how to have anal sex and teaching boys are little girls i mean
[23:28.800 --> 23:35.560]  these people are just sick cult members and it goes on ladies and gentlemen saying oh
[23:35.560 --> 23:40.280]  you're not allowed to protest it now because you're hateful so let's continue here ladies
[23:40.280 --> 23:46.360]  and gentlemen you want to put out the cdc admitted and linked to old 2020 news reports
[23:46.360 --> 23:53.200]  from 18 years ago facebook says no and it goes on facebook is achieving this by labeling
[23:53.200 --> 23:59.120]  vaccine awareness information misinformation or hoaxes and it uses groups funded by soros
[23:59.120 --> 24:06.600]  and others snopes and other groups that are complete jokes to do this and it goes on to
[24:06.600 --> 24:13.600]  break all of this down the censorship trick limiting content to authoritative information
[24:13.600 --> 24:18.760]  manufacturers are grossly immune for product liability so the incentive to develop safer
[24:18.760 --> 24:23.440]  products is much diminished there are enormous conflicts of interest involving lucrative
[24:23.440 --> 24:27.920]  relationships with vaccine purveyors and the media and government research into possible
[24:27.920 --> 24:34.160]  vaccine adverse effects is being quashed as is dissent by professionals vaccines are neither
[24:34.160 --> 24:39.640]  100% safe 100% effective nor are they the only available means of control spread of disease
[24:39.640 --> 24:44.840]  many cases they lower your immunity if you all sorts of problems and the article goes
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.640]  on thus truth becomes a hoax and lies become the official truth before long facebook won't
[24:49.640 --> 24:55.680]  even allow any human opinions at all and their social media site will be nothing but a i
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.960]  robot spewing official propaganda that meets the definition of authoritative information
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.920]  and globalist establishment imagine being banned from facebook for saying that vitamin
[25:05.920 --> 25:12.000]  c boost your immune function that's exactly what's all ready happening so once you give
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.400]  in to the nazis being banned and then alex jones being banned and then michelle malkin
[25:17.400 --> 25:23.320]  being banned and then everybody's banned and that's what's happening and you say oh there's
[25:23.320 --> 25:27.880]  billions of us online will counter it they can have the bots and ai as avatars as fake
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.480]  people they already are most people on facebook have fake friends and fake avatars that know
[25:32.480 --> 25:37.960]  everything about them and put out false messages to them and most of the dating apps are our
[25:37.960 --> 25:41.320]  robots and are fake manipulating you and getting more of your money you think you're talking
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.960]  to a woman or a man it's all a scam and so what what regular scammers have done online
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.320]  i personally know several old women who got hundreds of thousands of dollars taken from
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.960]  them from you know young studs that wanted to date them and now i'm seeing the cases in
[25:57.960 --> 26:03.000]  the news of where it's an ai robot doing it but run by humans i mean this is all criminal
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.800]  it's all exploitive and we've put up with so much but the dam's breaking and the decision
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.400]  has been made that we put up with it so katie bar the door i want to get into this now look
[26:13.400 --> 26:19.560]  at george soros in one of his latest photos look at him's with his hundreds of billions
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.200]  of stolen money it's not just 50 billion with all the state department money he gets with
[26:23.200 --> 26:27.480]  his own people still inside the state department that we're trying to remove trumps trying to
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.080]  remove it and when you expose their own people in the state department winehouse they say
[26:32.080 --> 26:37.040]  they don't work for him when on record they do publicly but again they're just counting
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.200]  on you not looking it up and they're counting on intimidating people and saying you'll go
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.760]  to jail if you discuss it or we'll destroy you or we'll sue you well we have to call
[26:45.760 --> 26:50.880]  their bluff somebody's got to stand up to these people and i got to tell you that's a man
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.800]  that's going to have to face god one day and you're going to have to face god as well and
[26:55.800 --> 27:00.760]  i know this audience of activists is incredible but listen he hates you because he knows you're
[27:00.760 --> 27:06.120]  awake he knows you're involved he knows you're engaged and he knows you're standing up and
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.640]  there's a critical point that comes that when all their tyranny's being enforced and flooded
[27:09.640 --> 27:13.640]  in against free humanity that they know there's going to be a resistance so they want to knock
[27:13.640 --> 27:19.880]  out the leaders of that hoping that they can then contain it and isolate people and surveil
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.400]  people and stop it but it's not going to work that way humanity knows the truth and their
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.280]  house of cards and their pedophile rings and their satanism and their true evil is coming
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.760]  out because of you we're going to break on which one is going to take over with all the

[32:07.480 --> 32:15.880]  of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit
[32:15.880 --> 32:24.280]  and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no
[32:24.280 --> 32:32.360]  limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil
[32:32.360 --> 32:38.920]  doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people
[32:38.920 --> 32:46.200]  have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our
[32:46.200 --> 32:52.520]  houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's
[32:52.520 --> 32:58.680]  band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are dangerous
[32:58.680 --> 33:14.600]  cult leaders in its time you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:16.040 --> 33:22.680]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[33:22.680 --> 33:34.680]  front lines of the info war and so it begins there's a big article by steve watson on info
[33:34.680 --> 33:42.360]  wars dot com that shows countless videos and news reports documenting the fact that suddenly
[33:43.160 --> 33:51.800]  police departments all over the united states and areas of europe are using robot dogs to go into
[33:51.800 --> 33:58.440]  suspects homes now on the surface this is a great thing it protects police officers
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.640]  from dangerous situations and gets them intel when they're serving warrants when they're dealing
[34:05.640 --> 34:11.880]  with the suspects is refusing to come out but that's not the issue i'll get back to the dogs in a
[34:11.880 --> 34:21.800]  moment the point is automation is taking humans out of our environment and we are losing all of
[34:21.800 --> 34:29.160]  our basic human skills that took eons to develop whether it's hunting and fishing and trapping or
[34:29.880 --> 34:36.760]  preparing and weaving and making clothing or whether it's cooking or whether it's even language
[34:36.760 --> 34:44.280]  language is shrinking a great example of course is the calculator before the calculator was made
[34:44.280 --> 34:52.120]  inexpensive back in the late 1970s by texas instruments it would take a computer that would
[34:52.120 --> 34:59.560]  fill up an entire floor of an office building to do what a calculator at that point would do and
[34:59.560 --> 35:05.560]  back then people knew arithmetic the average person could quickly do math in their head or
[35:05.560 --> 35:12.040]  with a piece of paper now without a calculator most adults can't even do basic arithmetic so
[35:12.040 --> 35:18.040]  that's an example right there now with the quote ad bit of smartphones and everybody's phone numbers
[35:18.040 --> 35:25.800]  being saved in them i remember before smartphones came out just 10 11 years ago i had hundreds of
[35:25.800 --> 35:32.760]  phone numbers memorized in my brain along comes the cell phone when i changed numbers a few years
[35:32.760 --> 35:38.920]  ago it took me months and months to you remember what my cell phone was because i was simply sharing
[35:38.920 --> 35:44.280]  the number with people phone to phone and didn't need to memorize it now i could talk about this
[35:44.280 --> 35:52.440]  for hours but driving home last night at 70 miles an hour on the upper deck of 290 i just thought
[35:52.440 --> 35:58.600]  about how incredibly dangerous this was and how really gladiatorial it was here were all these cars
[35:58.600 --> 36:04.760]  just a few feet to my left a few feet to my right 20 30 feet in front of me maybe a dozen feet behind
[36:04.760 --> 36:13.720]  me and we were all in concert focused and hurtling down the road in really a beautiful ballet of
[36:13.720 --> 36:21.400]  danger now as the smart driving cars come in big tech admits their plan is to extinct humans
[36:21.400 --> 36:26.440]  driving cars quote for everyone's safety and the driverless cars are now gone from just being a
[36:26.440 --> 36:31.880]  few here a few there to all over austin you'll see suddenly hundreds of google cars out in packs
[36:31.880 --> 36:38.280]  driving around together and again they're replacing humans and the argument is well we're all going
[36:38.280 --> 36:45.880]  to be safe but really what we're doing is making ourselves obsolete and there's a larger plan
[36:45.880 --> 36:52.120]  behind that again i'm not telling you anything you don't know but this is the central issue and this
[36:52.120 --> 36:59.560]  is the globalist key to total control we are becoming domesticated we are being made obsolete
[36:59.560 --> 37:06.040]  our iqs are dropping our life expectancy is dropping our infant mortality is exploding and
[37:06.040 --> 37:15.240]  it's not doing it slowly we're losing years on our life every two years on average it's as if in
[37:15.240 --> 37:22.840]  it's as if in the last five years we went off the edge of a cliff and it's not just the us it's every
[37:22.840 --> 37:31.320]  industrialized nation it's the wireless it's the gmo it's the particular it's the vaccines what do
[37:31.320 --> 37:39.400]  vaccines do well they're tainted they're part of a covert program going back to sasuki with a syphilis
[37:39.400 --> 37:47.160]  and the sv-40 cancer viruses and so many other purposeful contaminants in fact they're not contaminants
[37:47.160 --> 37:54.920]  the trojan horse at troye confirmed to be historically real was not a gift the gift was
[37:54.920 --> 38:05.400]  simply the surface reason the soldiers inside were the payload so again with the vaccines
[38:05.400 --> 38:13.080]  themselves they are lowering our immunity and they are carrying payloads in them that are binary
[38:13.080 --> 38:20.520]  and work with other weapons systems in the environment this is not my opinion this is
[38:20.520 --> 38:26.840]  incontrovertible fact i don't report this to you so that we can have victimology and feel sorry for
[38:26.840 --> 38:34.200]  ourselves i report this to you so that we can develop systems of understanding and have a mass
[38:34.200 --> 38:43.000]  awakening against this covert medical technocracy and overthrow it as we've begun to do with the
[38:43.000 --> 38:53.800]  first level of their system unaccounted unaccountable global corporate governance if you defeat the
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.760]  structure of global government which is totally illegitimate tax exempt offshore above the law
[38:58.760 --> 39:05.560]  then the entire structure of what they're deploying fails because for it to be successful it must be
[39:05.560 --> 39:12.920]  done on every nation of the globe the ambient background must turn up slowly like the frog
[39:12.920 --> 39:21.000]  in the pot with the slow degradation and poisoning as it builds towards the crescendo that's why
[39:21.000 --> 39:30.280]  apple and facebook and twitter and google are all in concert censoring blocking vaccine damage
[39:30.280 --> 39:38.280]  info blocking vaccine insert info because when it goes from 1 in 35 000 with autism to 1 in 58
[39:38.280 --> 39:46.040]  with autism to 1 in 20 like it's going to be by 2030 conservatively people are going to start
[39:46.040 --> 39:53.960]  revolting and as the vaccine numbers increase and more people die and more people see folks
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.680]  in the clinics having convulsions and hitting their heads there's going to be a revolt that's
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.640]  why there's got to be massive peer pressure around it to say none of it's happening even
[40:03.640 --> 40:11.400]  though the statistics and the numbers and the facts are there now let's talk robot takeover
[40:11.400 --> 40:17.160]  just a few weeks ago there was all this hysteria about communist china selling killer drones and
[40:17.160 --> 40:23.720]  robots to middle eastern countries more than seven nations have put in giant orders some of them in
[40:23.720 --> 40:29.720]  the billions of dollars for robots from china notice the dam just broke until a few years ago
[40:29.720 --> 40:35.000]  was oh that's terminator hysteria about jones and mark dice and others there's not going to be any
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.680]  rise the machines and then suddenly snap your fingers snap your neck suddenly oh there's robot
[40:42.680 --> 40:49.640]  police in tokyo in new york oh suddenly there's robot dogs in grants given to everyone here's the
[40:49.640 --> 40:55.160]  problem once these systems outnumber the humans which can be very very quickly when it comes to
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.640]  law enforcement outnumber soldiers then it could be centrally programmed and made to be autonomous
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.760]  which they already are and then it's checkmate and that's why they're moving in with systems to
[41:06.760 --> 41:13.080]  put women in charge in the marine corps and make them army wear red high heel shoes is to kill morale
[41:13.080 --> 41:19.720]  this is all admitted that's why at the air force academy and other institutions it's ordered by
[41:19.720 --> 41:25.800]  the top people to go put inward on the vending machines and in the bunks to create division
[41:25.800 --> 41:32.360]  to destroy morale to sabotage human systems ahead of the machine rollout because humans are going
[41:32.360 --> 41:41.000]  to be so lazy so poison so stupid so divided on race and sex that we will not be able to cohesively
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.640]  even operate people don't know how to brush their teeth properly they don't know how to wipe their
[41:45.640 --> 41:51.640]  ass properly they don't understand anything there's already total societal breakdown
[41:51.640 --> 41:59.160]  with millennials and others you go to a university they look and act like zombies all they're educated
[41:59.160 --> 42:07.800]  about is hating fellow humans according to what color their skin is this is a diabolical master
[42:07.800 --> 42:16.280]  takeover plan and clearly nationalist in poland hungry brazil the united states are really pro-humanists
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.680]  and understand this are trying to stabilize the family stabilize production stabilize the work
[42:22.680 --> 42:29.720]  ethic because through that we activate our natural programming our instincts and are successful and by
[42:29.720 --> 42:36.360]  facing crises and not being victims just like lifting weights are going for a jog we become
[42:36.360 --> 42:42.840]  stronger if we recognize the globalist attack for what it is and organize around resisting it
[42:42.840 --> 42:49.560]  and warning fellow humans it will activate the neural pathways and genetic weapon systems that
[42:49.560 --> 43:00.680]  we have built into us to override these programs and defeat this agenda i've made a lot of predictions
[43:00.680 --> 43:06.360]  that have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came
[43:06.360 --> 43:12.360]  out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in game
[43:12.360 --> 43:18.360]  agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting a sub to bd platform that they
[43:18.360 --> 43:26.280]  were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[43:26.280 --> 43:32.840]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[43:32.840 --> 43:39.400]  what the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the
[43:39.400 --> 43:45.800]  model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.600]  information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's
[43:50.600 --> 43:58.680]  why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever black friday

[46:02.120 --> 46:09.320]  powerful globalist leftist anti american organizations on the face of the planet and they have declared
[46:09.320 --> 46:16.600]  that info wars is public enemy number one they gave tim cook of apple an award specifically
[46:16.600 --> 46:23.080]  for deplat forming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show and
[46:23.080 --> 46:29.800]  now they've had sasha barat cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that do not
[46:29.800 --> 46:37.000]  turn full control over to the globalist adl and they've called for a complete purge of anyone
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.280]  promoting americana we are being demoralized we are being conquered and the enemy wants to shut
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.680]  info wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat their

[47:23.960 --> 47:37.560]  worldwide it's alex jones the way we're going is stagnation and death we are being killed now i knew
[47:37.560 --> 47:44.200]  this a long time ago but i still made the decision to get married again and to have another child
[47:44.200 --> 47:49.160]  she's not even three years old yet and she's magic and she's special and as the enemy tries to suppress
[47:49.160 --> 47:53.880]  humanity we're going to see a lot of special attributes a lot of special gifts are going to be
[47:53.880 --> 47:59.880]  given to us and given to these children being born into this so i encourage everyone to not give in
[47:59.880 --> 48:04.360]  to the enemy's threat and say oh my god i'm not going to have children as all the major EU leaders
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.000]  have done because even though they're evil globalists they are scared to have children because that
[48:09.000 --> 48:17.080]  might activate their humanity have children bet them on this game of life god wants to see that
[48:17.080 --> 48:23.720]  and fight for them for a pro human future because we don't have children we have capitulated to the
[48:23.720 --> 48:29.480]  enemy and we have already given up the answer is planting crops of non-gmo like russia is doing
[48:29.480 --> 48:34.680]  they basically outlawed gmo and are moving to be the biggest non-gmo producer in the world
[48:35.720 --> 48:42.680]  these are the type of things we need to do right now we have to recognize this is an agenda and we
[48:42.680 --> 48:48.760]  have to see how everywhere we're being made obsolete we have to see how everywhere the system is
[48:48.760 --> 48:56.040]  being set up to territorially push us out and have these new technotronic tech lords in command of
[48:56.040 --> 49:01.720]  it who are all building the exact same post-human world but competing with each other over who is
[49:01.720 --> 49:09.160]  going to be dominant when the AI system finally takes total control there is a digital electronic
[49:09.160 --> 49:14.520]  fiber optic wireless prison being built around you and i want to explain something 20 years ago
[49:15.160 --> 49:21.640]  in 1999 bill joy wrote an article for wire magazine called why the future doesn't need humans
[49:23.160 --> 49:30.760]  how he went to a big tech retreat with all the top billionaires all the top tech people
[49:30.760 --> 49:35.960]  and the consensus was instead of just giving people entertainment and high-tech video games
[49:35.960 --> 49:42.600]  and just letting humans live on like in the movie walley laying around on some high-tech cruise
[49:42.600 --> 49:49.560]  ship with robots serving us the decision was made to go ahead and just slowly poison and kill us
[49:49.560 --> 49:56.200]  and go ahead and phase out humanity and the united states and england and japan are on the very front
[49:56.200 --> 50:04.360]  lines deploying this to beta test it and then have it adopted worldwide so everyone needs to run from
[50:04.360 --> 50:11.400]  this everyone needs to run from the green movement everyone needs to run from all of these anti-human
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.680]  programs because it's all about the industrialization it's all about shutdown and the flooding of
[50:16.680 --> 50:25.400]  entertainment and drugs and fentanyl is just one level of the soft kill operation it was obama
[50:25.400 --> 50:31.160]  authorized china to flood us with enough fentanyl to kill the world's population over and over again
[50:31.160 --> 50:39.240]  every week that's how much comes to the us 50 000 pounds here 20 000 pounds there one grain of it
[50:39.880 --> 50:45.480]  of pure fentanyl kill you again that's just one more level of what's being brought in and then
[50:45.480 --> 50:50.520]  we wonder why the homeless are exploding and just laying out on cots everywhere all over the country
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.200]  many of them dying in even small towns and big cities every day and being loaded up and taken away
[50:56.200 --> 51:02.360]  this is the soil and green program this is the program where we're totally taught how to stand
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.520]  up for ourselves and stand up for children and stand up for the unborn and to and to forfeit
[51:06.520 --> 51:12.120]  our instincts that we see the young of our species being being harvested that we don't even stand up
[51:12.120 --> 51:19.160]  and these federal judges rule against courts below them that try to protect the unborn ladies and
[51:19.160 --> 51:28.360]  gentlemen a mass culling is coming and humanity will be so dumbed down and so obsolete that those
[51:28.360 --> 51:34.200]  of us that are still awake and conscious and who have overcome a lot of this are going to be
[51:35.080 --> 51:41.480]  in a prime position to join the globalist and help wipe out the rest of humanity and that's
[51:41.480 --> 51:47.640]  actually the deal that the social engineers are actually preparing they believe in social
[51:47.640 --> 51:52.680]  Darwinism and then it's their right and their duty to carry all of this out and to accelerate
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.720]  the survival of the fittest by creating this artificial system that will basically kill
[51:57.720 --> 52:05.480]  grid 99 percent of the population and because they succumb to it via Darwinism they deserve it
[52:05.480 --> 52:11.000]  and those of us that see through it will then supposedly ascend but that's a lie itself because
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.400]  the technocrats say that a post-human world is coming and that we're going to have to merge
[52:15.400 --> 52:21.560]  and this is the final statement merge with these machines and become transcendent by merging with
[52:21.560 --> 52:27.960]  silicon and throwing off our bodies which of course is the biggest con of all and so at the end
[52:27.960 --> 52:32.360]  this whole thing is anti-human it's about stealing our destiny it's about damning us off from the
[52:32.360 --> 52:37.320]  future and it is the most satanic thing you could ever imagine it's not a nightmare dystopic science
[52:37.320 --> 52:44.280]  fiction movie it's the real world and so instead of just trying to keep ourselves withdrawn from
[52:44.280 --> 52:49.560]  this system which is impossible we have to go out we have to fight this system and we'll be in the
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.680]  system we'll be with outside the system and some people are going to end up getting augmented and
[52:54.680 --> 52:59.320]  they're going to decide to merge with machines in the name of countering this but all of it has
[52:59.320 --> 53:07.000]  Trojan horses built in all of it in the end is very very seductive and very very evil and no good
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.640]  is going to come out of any of it everything that's being deployed is making our lives worse it's
[53:11.640 --> 53:15.640]  not making it better there have been many technologies and systems designed that would make us stronger
[53:15.640 --> 53:20.120]  but they don't want that so the first rule is we've all got to get in physical shape we've got to get
[53:20.120 --> 53:24.840]  close to god we've got to get mentally clear we've got to eat healthier and we've got to reach out
[53:24.840 --> 53:31.160]  to others and just start warning people about what's happening because once people get into this
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.920]  decadent mindset and once they get disconnected from reality and and healthy lifestyles it's much
[53:36.920 --> 53:43.480]  easier for the corrupt programming to be updated with the really satanic programs that resemble
[53:43.480 --> 53:48.360]  demon possession and that's why you're seeing this type of insanity intensify so we're going into
[53:48.360 --> 53:53.720]  incredibly dangerous times but you've got to double down and you've got to continue to support
[53:53.720 --> 54:02.680]  this broadcast it's the only way that we're going to be able to continue into the future with everything
[54:02.680 --> 54:07.960]  the globalists are throwing at us and it's imperative that we be able to expand i've got a
[54:07.960 --> 54:13.160]  lot of operations going on that i can't tell you about at this point but i do need major major
[54:13.160 --> 54:19.160]  capital to be able to really take it to the globalist in a way not before seen because i can i can
[54:19.160 --> 54:25.640]  tell and i can predict and i know what their next big moves are going to be two years from now five
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.800]  years from now ten years from now and i can now be steps ahead of them i remember so long ago i
[54:29.800 --> 54:34.600]  wished if i could have hindsight when i was a younger man of all the things that about a known
[54:34.600 --> 54:40.520]  back then when i started fighting the globalist 25 years ago what i could have done well god
[54:40.520 --> 54:44.200]  spoke to me just a few days ago and said well now you can do that now you have the discernment
[54:44.200 --> 54:51.480]  the understanding to actually be able to think into the future at a higher level and make preparations
[54:52.680 --> 54:56.920]  that will absolutely devastate the globalists and they know this and they understand that the
[54:56.920 --> 55:02.200]  reason they're wanting to shut me down and shut you down and silence all of us is not for what we've

[57:01.080 --> 57:09.880]  of us but we just don't really pay attention we just move on us fertility rate hits record low
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.680]  after four consecutive years of decline that's one headline the next one more americans say
[57:14.680 --> 57:20.440]  they weigh 200 pounds or more this decade so it's just more americans are unhealthy out of shape so
[57:20.440 --> 57:26.520]  you know humanity's dying but see that headline gets no play but i guarantee you if the headline
[57:26.520 --> 57:30.520]  instead of saying us fertility rate hits record low after four consecutive years of decline
[57:30.520 --> 57:35.800]  if that headline said trump fertility rate hits record low after four consecutive years of decline
[57:35.800 --> 57:43.960]  it would be headline news but if it's all of humanity nobody cares so that's just incredible
[57:43.960 --> 57:51.800]  how that works we'll be right back there's a famous quote by marine court general
[57:51.800 --> 57:57.720]  in the korean war when three million chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded
[57:57.720 --> 58:04.920]  the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered
[58:04.920 --> 58:11.000]  and the general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all
[58:11.000 --> 58:18.120]  directions well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is
[58:18.120 --> 58:23.800]  biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support but it's going to become more
[58:23.800 --> 58:30.680]  critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks
[58:30.680 --> 58:35.960]  all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistle
[58:35.960 --> 58:42.760]  blower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars
[58:42.760 --> 58:53.240]  having its own platform that checkmates the globalists beto roark came out dozens of times and
[58:53.240 --> 58:58.040]  said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats
[58:58.040 --> 59:04.520]  on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats
[59:04.520 --> 59:10.120]  have taken all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes
[59:10.120 --> 59:17.240]  covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know
[59:17.240 --> 59:22.920]  what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be
[59:22.920 --> 59:28.200]  sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen
[59:28.200 --> 59:33.640]  this country's under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying
[59:33.640 --> 59:37.640]  they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of
[59:37.640 --> 59:42.760]  rights and constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see
[59:42.760 --> 59:47.160]  a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[59:47.160 --> 59:54.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:28.440]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones with only 346 days left to the 2020
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:34.840]  historic election there is still time for president trump and the american people to act but not much
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:41.320]  president trump and his campaign head part scales have come out as everybody knows the last 24 hours
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:48.440]  and said that google and other big tech companies are engaged in concerted voter suppression and
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:54.120]  that is exactly what they're doing a massive form of election fraud now remember professor
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:07:00.360]  ebbstein will play some clips coming up in a moment testified to congress this year that in
[1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:09.160]  the 2018 election just doing basic sampling he was able to show how google could easily block
[1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:18.200]  five 10 15 20 30 million people from voting simply by not sending election updates and reminders to
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:23.080]  people that are conservative in their algorithm and google admits they can do that and here's the news
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:29.000]  they are doing so when twitter came out two weeks ago under orders from hillary and said we're not
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  going to take political advertising that is only going to target republicans because the democrats
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:41.240]  have thousands of front groups through facebook twitter and the other platforms they call themselves
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:46.200]  news that soros and others are funding that put out one minute two minute three minute five
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:52.120]  minute ten minute special reports that are really political advertising that's why they
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:57.960]  always want to ban major political donations because that's going to shut down conservatives
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:03.560]  who actually buy ads and who don't control the media we have to buy access nationalists have to buy
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:09.640]  access to the system so when twitter came out and said no political advertising that means we're not
[1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:15.960]  going to take trump political advertising republican political advertising there's been a major
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.120]  political realignment so republicans are raising money two to one against the democrats americans
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:25.960]  are fighting back they're awake so the democrats simply said okay we're not going to let you
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.840]  place your ads which is total and complete election meddling and voter suppression and
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:38.440]  i said two weeks ago if trump doesn't act on twitter now and doesn't file the you know court
[1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:42.520]  filings in the right courts where they aren't democrat judges because we can't wait for to go
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:47.320]  to the supreme court if we don't get injunctions now if he doesn't take action on a lot of different
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:53.800]  fronts they're going to do it on google and apple and facebook and lo and behold that's where all
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:09:00.360]  this is going facebook is the last company that we know of that said about a week ago that they're
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:05.880]  not going to restrict political ads completely that's why sasha barron cohen and the adl came
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:12.120]  out last week and said we're gonna arrest mark zuckerberg if he doesn't let us have full control
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:18.200]  of his system and they attacked trump by name and talked about upcoming elections and how there was
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:25.720]  this big lie of replacement migration for america and europe when that's an official un plan so again
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:30.680]  this is for all the marbles they do not respect trump they do not respect american law enforcement
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:34.840]  they do not respect the american people they do not respect the pentagon they do not respect the
[1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:41.800]  rule of law they have their people in place everywhere and trump keeps criticizing the censorship
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:46.920]  they think he's weak because at every test trump and the american people have failed
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:53.560]  at every test when they censor more more more nothing's done and so i said this six months
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:58.120]  ago i said it a month ago i said it last week i said it on monday the last thing they're going
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:04.040]  to take is the political advertising and then they're going to clamp down on individuals being able
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:11.080]  to share information even more and that's now been done because trump and the republican party
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:15.960]  have failed and listen the republican blueblocks in my emergency message is the president from
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:19.800]  earlier this year i asked four or five months ago why is president trump committing political
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:25.000]  suicide and i said in that is because the political class is going to make a couple billion dollars
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:29.480]  off of this election and they don't care about the grassroots people on the internet get shut
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:33.880]  down who are supporting trump and supporting america and supporting nationalism and want our
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:37.640]  country to go on it's just existing even though we don't make any money off the political campaign
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:42.040]  and they're not seeking money they still see us as competition so they're more than happy to see
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:48.280]  all of us silenced because what does that do that that's just more money for them and that makes
[1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:55.000]  trump more reliant on tv ads radio ads print ads and the few platforms where he's able to actually
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:02.520]  run ads but you see now because trump failed the test they're now going to silence him as well
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:07.400]  and silence the politicos who want to be able to run the ads but not have them be effective
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:11.880]  because they secretly want trump to lose because they want the gravy train and the lobbyist
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:16.440]  and things to continue into the future in the cell of america so trump and his campaign
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:24.280]  chairman have absolutely miscalculated they have screwed the pooch or royal and with 346 days left
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:31.800]  and counting if trump doesn't have devastating action within a month or two maximum with indictments
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:39.960]  and investigations and with injunctions filed letting free and equal access to the marketplace
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  of ideas it's over during all the campaigns of the past 50 60 years there have been cases where
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:50.920]  newspapers tv stations radio stations wouldn't let people run ads and there were lawsuits over it
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:56.600]  not letting other candidates have access to that there are laws on the damn books but the politicos
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:02.120]  think trump is stupid so it is an emergency to get this message to the president for everybody
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:06.680]  to call the white house for everybody to call congress and for everybody to realize what's
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:12.440]  really going on here now even if trump sits there on his hands and continues to suck his thumb
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:16.360]  he's a nationalist he's pro-gun he's been defending the border he's been trying to bring
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:19.960]  our industry back he's in a trade war with shana i still totally back him so even if they're going
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:25.640]  to be in a catatonic state it's up to us to hit the streets third dimension protest demonstrations
[1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:30.040]  call in the c span call the suck radio go and take over all these democrat public events like
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:35.080]  we do with the armored vehicle jacking into the media go to live football events jump on the tv
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:40.040]  screen legally and lawfully get information out there epsy didn't kill himself in fours dot com
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:44.360]  people will then come to info wars dot com once it's associated with exposing the f-stein situation
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.440]  which were the groundbreakers of and that will become part of the narrative of people not just
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:53.240]  knowing about f-stein being murdered and showing that they're not being lied to showing that they're
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:57.880]  aware of what's going on but it'll also then tie it to info wars and the larger nationalist movement
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:02.920]  that we've launched that is absolute kryptonite and coffin nails to the new world order so trump
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:08.680]  is now finally waking up we've got a chance we absolutely slapped the white house upside the
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:13.640]  head and wake them up to still turn things around and win this election that's critical to restore
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:18.360]  in the republic but all of you need to go bullhorn the white white house and tell trump to take action
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:22.200]  all of you need to send this to everybody you know that works in the white house all of you who
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:26.040]  work in the secret service in other areas need to reach out and give the president this info like
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:31.480]  you've given him intel before all of our futures depend on this now i have told you exactly how
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:37.000]  this would unfold it is unfolding this way and again what's going to come next is going to be even
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:44.200]  more insane if trump and the republicans let the democrats ban them from political advertising
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:48.280]  this is so the media and the universities and all the think tanks all the little fake news
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:55.080]  organizations can pile up and absolutely uh demonize trump demonize america and foment
[1:13:55.080 --> 1:14:00.200]  revolution and foment civil war and then we're going to have radio silence and be unable to
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:05.720]  counter this this is a total authoritarian move so i cannot stress this enough mayday mayday mayday
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:09.800]  this is an emergency message to president trump this is an emergency message to america this is
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:14.360]  an emergency message the world that the united states falls the globalist it is going to be
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:19.240]  worse than the old soviet union and worse than nazi germany and all of you are in danger as well
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:23.160]  we are under international attack by globalist forces and the chai comms ganged up with collaborators
[1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:27.000]  inside america against us there is no foreign meddling except by the globalist but we need
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.480]  foreigners people all around the world to also spread the word about what's happening in america
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:36.520]  and aid us from outside the country by coming into message boards and coming into the news
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:40.200]  and coming into letters to the editor and pointing out what's really happening and
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:45.320]  understanding that trump's fight is the world's fight and is all of our fight again trump must
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:50.280]  take action now trump must take action now he must not just take action on these political ads
[1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:55.160]  he's gonna lose even if they reverse on that he's got to let the free speech come back they've got
[1:14:55.160 --> 1:15:00.360]  to take action now this must be done now there's no more time to play games i've been proven right
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:03.880]  this is all happening in front of everybody's face now is the time back to own shroyer and
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:08.440]  live coverage of this but whatever you do folks this is a maximum effort on this situation
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:12.600]  to get president trump to take action and stop voter suppression and election meddling you have
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:19.640]  been warned very strong public supporter of hillary clinton yes so you're not just dismayed

[1:17:54.600 --> 1:18:02.760]  the anti defamation league is one of the most powerful globalist leftist
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:07.080]  anti-american organizations on the face of the planet and they have declared
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:14.360]  that info wars is public enemy number one they gave tim cook of apple an award specifically
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:19.960]  for deplat forming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:27.560]  and now they've had sasha bary cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that do not
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:34.760]  turn full control over to the globalist adl and they've called for a complete purge of anyone
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:39.800]  promoting americana we are being demoralized we are being conquered and the enemy wants to
[1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:44.280]  shut info wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:49.640]  their paradigm you have helped keep us on the air but now the attacks are more insane than ever
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:53.640]  so please visit info war store dot com during black friday for the biggest sales of the year
[1:18:53.640 --> 1:19:01.160]  and fund the info war please take action a question was once posed to thomas jefferson
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:10.920]  what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity too how far will they go what's
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:19.240]  their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is
[1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:27.320]  there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture in society
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:34.200]  that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:41.800]  same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:47.320]  and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:54.040]  oxford's band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:20:17.400]  dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:17.400 --> 1:20:25.800]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he it's alex jones and now your host owin treuer
[1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:39.320]  so in the last segment you heard alex jones breaking down google's election interference
[1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:44.760]  election fraud election manipulation colluding with the democrats to do it
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:50.280]  but it goes beyond that and i'm going to break that down here in this segment so
[1:20:52.680 --> 1:21:00.840]  when you see the headline or the headlines about brad parscale and the trump campaign accusing
[1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:08.200]  google of suppressing voter turnout just know that that's the tip of the iceberg and you hope
[1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:19.240]  hope that president trump and his 2020 campaign realize that but you know what hope is not enough
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:26.760]  ladies and gentlemen action is what is needed to tweet out these stories to brad parscale
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:31.640]  and the president and everyone on his campaign team and the trump war room and all of it
[1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:40.440]  talking about the censorship showing how it's an issue combined calling the white house calling
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:49.400]  your member of congress but let's go deeper into this because it goes beyond google but let's hammer
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:55.080]  google out here because they've been exposed this is not a conspiracy theory what google is doing here
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:22:02.040]  some headlines and we had zack worris in studio this week the google whistleblower goes public i
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:11.080]  saw something dark and nefarious going on what's he talking about talking about how tech is taking
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:18.360]  sides what does that mean the search results that you get are curated to only see one side of the
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:25.000]  aisles perspective or what they want you to see better yet and so you won't see the clinton body
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:32.520]  count on google you won't see positive trump news on google you won't see positive news on anybody
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:42.200]  that they want only negative and then the reversal is true if they want positive news about you
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:49.960]  you they will only provide that in their search results there's nbc news google search algorithms
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:54.920]  are not impartial they can be biased just like their designers so what do you think is going on
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:01.320]  senior google engineer goes public on camera tech is dangerous taking side project veritas has
[1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:09.000]  learned that greg coppola placed on administrative leave by google that was the other individual
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:19.160]  insider whistleblower google machine learning whistleblower goes public burden lifted off
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:28.200]  my soul so this is just what google is doing here's a perfect example let's try this in real time
[1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:40.280]  if you search jeffrey eppstein on google it used to pop up american financier american financier not
[1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:49.400]  criminal not pedophile not sex offender not sex trafficker american financier oh and it still is
[1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:59.160]  there now of course google can't bury all the eppstein news like they would have in the past
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:05.400]  but you can apply the same technique and just guess what will show up if you search
[1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:09.720]  a hillary clinton or a donald trump all negative headlines about donald trump
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:16.760]  all positive headlines about hillary clinton and so while that in and of itself is an issue
[1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:24.600]  when it comes to public perception it's a bigger issue when as the trump campaign addresses it
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:33.320]  voter depression because how many people won't go out and vote for a candidate because they
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:40.040]  only see negative stories about them on google aka trump and of course that's their goal
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:49.480]  but that's just one level of it i had the crew print out all the different community
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:58.920]  guidelines on instagram the standards on facebook for hate speech appropriate for their audience
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:07.640]  snapchat you know it's funny they talk about sexually explicit content content on these
[1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:11.080]  platforms yet that's all out there but a conservative that supports trump they'll get
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:16.920]  shut down immediately abusive behavior hate speech all this content in the community
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:23.000]  guidelines for twitter for facebook for snapchat for instagram yet i guarantee you we won't do
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:29.320]  this in real time you can go find the most sexually explicit stuff on all these platforms if you
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:35.880]  really wanted to but you won't be able to find info wars live don't make sure that gets shut down
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:38.120]  you see how that works
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:48.920]  why instagram's new anti-bullying filtering is so dangerous forbs zero hedge russian trolls
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:53.160]  have virtually no effect on us twitter users according to duke university research well why
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:26:03.400]  would that even be a story because they use the straw man of russian trolls as an excuse
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:09.240]  for their censorship oh we're censoring russian trolls when it's really thousands of trump supporters
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:18.600]  putting content out there and they just say russian bots twitter will remove dehumanizing
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.640]  content against religious groups but that's only aimed in one direction you know which way facebook
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:29.160]  google microsoft twitter and adl announced lab to engineer new solutions to stop cyber hate well
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:35.000]  that just gets politically aimed facebook needs humans and algorithms to filter hate speech again
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:45.560]  hate speech according to who facebook tax taps next gen ai to detect hate speech ai designed by who
[1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:57.640]  so this is what they do and then of course they can be specific facebook bans all content on vaccine
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:01.880]  awareness including facts about vaccine and get ingredients that's literally the insert they're
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:12.120]  banning so you can go on a narrow minded pathway and look at one issue and say okay google manipulating
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:16.760]  their search results google manipulating their algorithms in a political fashion whether they
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:24.200]  want to admit it or not whether they want to say it's conscious or not that's what's going on it's
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:28.200]  been proven in real time insiders from google know it's going on they've come out they've blown the
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:35.560]  whistle they are real whistleblowers it's well known and so you can say yeah here's what that does
[1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:41.240]  for vote for voter turnout when it comes to trump support but that's one issue
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:53.240]  it gets back to the fake news they'll only let fake news show up you can't even open anything on google
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:28:00.840]  chrome anymore without getting anti-trump propaganda so yeah you know as trump's campaign manager you
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:06.680]  might want to do something about that you might want to be the winning campaign manager for 2020
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:12.920]  and so you might want to look into all the censorship of trump supporters on youtube on
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:21.160]  facebook on twitter on instagram you but you know beyond brad parscale if you're president trump you
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:28.200]  might want to look into the intimidation that the obama courts are doing to trump supporters
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:34.840]  with the treatment of roger stone and mike flinn and george popadopoulos and so it's all the same
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:49.560]  issue big tech using its power to steal american elections and they run fake news stories and engage
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:57.880]  in censorship to do it it's a combo effort with the democrat party hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting

[1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:05.800]  corps general in the korean war when three million chai comms had flooded across the border and
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:13.320]  surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:19.240]  outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:27.000]  in all directions well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really

[1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:39.800]  more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks

[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:29.080]  and now your host owin shroyer all right let me put a bow on this voter suppression issue
[1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:34.120]  that the trump campaign i guess is finally aware of or maybe finally realizing they need to take
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:40.680]  action i'm not sure maybe you can spur them into action by calling the white house tweeting at brad
[1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:51.000]  par scale the trump 2020 campaign manager tweeting at president trump and just trying to understand
[1:33:51.720 --> 1:33:56.120]  if they understand that it goes beyond just what google is doing and say combined effort
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:02.040]  with facebook with youtube with twitter and of course google
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:10.040]  to really stop people from getting information that they've never had access to before
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:19.800]  well what are you talking about what was it that got donald trump over the hump
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:30.520]  trump during the nomination process for the 2016 republican presidential candidate well it was
[1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:38.280]  really i mean not just the info wars audience i mean i've broken this down before but as a major
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:47.880]  wave and as a blockade against the intimidation it was this audience i mean it was really only
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:51.240]  three names it was really only an colter michael savage and alex jones i mean really in the whole
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:55.400]  media that was it folks that supported trump through the republican nomination process
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:34:59.160]  and of the three this audience is probably the biggest
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:08.760]  and more stubborn and more active and so while other audiences would have been intimidated
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:15.000]  into supporting trump showing their support for trump showing up at israelis voting for him not
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:24.120]  believing the fake news just like trump this audience stood there like a rock and endured
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:32.280]  and so that's why they had to get info wars off the air that's why they're trying to suppress
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:37.080]  anyone else from getting on air whether it be on youtube or twitter or facebook that may have any
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:43.800]  influence or any effect or any impact because they know there's still millions of americans out there
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:49.000]  that just aren't politically active those are the votes that they're going for but they know in a real
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:55.240]  in a real true constellation of ideas
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:03.560]  they don't stand a chance what they're offering is death and destruction what they're offering is
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:05.400]  lies and deceit
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:11.960]  and the average american still sees through that
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:20.680]  but if it's all they see and they can't compare it to anything else then they just think they're
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:26.200]  crazy then they just think they're isolated then they just think they're alone and they'll go with
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:30.600]  what they think is the winning team which is hating trump which of course is the losing team
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:36.520]  that's just the propaganda that they try to have confirmation bias a
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:48.600]  facsimile a faux confirmation bias confirming their bias through their big tech
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:55.400]  and then getting that into your eyes through your eyes into your head
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:03.160]  when there is no other candidate that can get 50 000 people in a rally trump does it routinely
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:06.760]  but then they show the polls as if it's real
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:17.480]  but americans are seeing through this and so in a last ditch effort the left that runs the
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:27.320]  tech companies were basically working with obama behind scenes they're doing everything they can
[1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:34.760]  to make trump look bad and to as red parskill and trump campaign are now realizing
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:45.240]  suppress voter turnout they think that's the new way they can defeat trump so keep the public
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:52.360]  uninformed and misinformed censor the biggest voices that got trump in office in 2016
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:38:02.840]  and then use the power of big tech of social media to keep the public in a trance totally
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:09.560]  unaware of what's going on and then when if trump loses pretend it's totally organic even though they
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:18.280]  know they did it with the censorship with the fake news and with the propaganda
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:26.120]  but that's just one issue because if you've got electronic voting machines that are rigged well
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:32.360]  I guess none of that really matters at the end of the day anyway does it but this story right here
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.320]  shows you where it goes from here a 17 year old girl talked about Chinese
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:43.560]  detention camps on tiktok tiktok suspended her account so just like the chinese dictatorship
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:53.800]  who runs tiktok will censor any chinese descent on tiktok that's what the tyrannical tech left
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:58.200]  does in the united states of america and then you have people coming out saying trump's a dictator
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:39:03.320]  man you know i don't wish trump was a dictator obviously but you know part of me wishes he was
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:09.800]  maybe for just five minutes because boy you guys would be off our back and off america's back and
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:19.480]  in a millisecond you're the fascists you're the dictators you operate like the chinese
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:22.920]  with their social credit score
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:32.680]  that's why some kids growing up indoctrinated into being white liberals they hate themselves
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:38.360]  because they're told they're taught that's how you get in that's how you succeed that's how you
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:49.400]  beat the racism and the bigotry is just hating yourself hating america hating individualism
[1:39:49.400 --> 1:40:04.440]  hating independence but let me get in to some of the other news here or you know what let me do this
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:11.000]  actually before i get into the fake impeachment news because it all actually ties into this at
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:21.480]  the end of the day past elections and this is actually so unbelievable this is almost maybe the
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:29.800]  biggest story in america today but it won't go covered judge rules in favor of washington man
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:41.800]  who had guns seized over satirical joker meme incel jokes so you see they're using social media as
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:47.080]  and you know about the social credit score in china but they're using social media as now the
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:54.360]  platform to look at with red flag gun laws oh look at what he posted on twitter take his guns
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:59.960]  well wait a second there's so many things that could be wrong with that doesn't matter we'll
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:05.720]  figure it out later no innocent until proven guilty shall not be infringed doesn't matter
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:14.120]  see the tech left authoritarians run everything now a king county judge ruled in favor of 23
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:20.280]  year old charles donnelly and ordered the state to give him his firearms back did you hear that
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:27.960]  the state took his guns because he made a joke on the internet
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:37.560]  so he puts up one ticket for joker please and puts his guns up now you can say hey
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:42.200]  maybe he should be looked at maybe he should be investigated
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:49.400]  well maybe if he's obtained the firearms illegally he's already had the background check
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:56.520]  and if somebody thinks there's a serious threat there well i guess the fbi can obviously look into
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:06.520]  that but he had his guns taken he was disarmed his property seized for a joke put on the internet
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:14.760]  and again you might sit here and say hey you know what that's bad we don't need that go
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:18.760]  ahead and and censor that on the internet or go ahead and take his guns no you see
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:27.000]  that sets the precedent that sets the precedent that you can just take anyone's guns or anyone's
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:34.760]  anything because of what they put on the internet so yeah while this while this decision by the judge
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:44.120]  is going to be ruled controversial shall not be infringed but it shows you the bigger picture folks
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:52.200]  they want to come after your guns they're using the internet to rig your political elections
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:59.880]  and to take your rights it's happening now the anti defamation league is one of the most powerful
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:06.040]  globalist leftist anti-american organizations on the face of the planet and they have declared
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:13.400]  that info wars is public enemy number one they gave tim cook of apple an award specifically
[1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:19.000]  for deplatforming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:26.200]  and now they've had sasha barrick cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:33.000]  do not turn full control over to the globalist adl and they've called for a complete purge
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:38.440]  of anyone promoting americana we are being demoralized we are being conquered and the enemy
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:43.000]  wants to shut info wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:48.200]  defeat their paradigm you have helped keep us on the air but now the attacks are more insane than
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:52.680]  ever so please visit info wars store dot com during black friday for the biggest sales of the year
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:59.560]  and fund the info war please take action i've made a lot of predictions that have come true
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:05.080]  but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a
[1:44:05.080 --> 1:44:10.840]  crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:16.680]  was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting a sub to bd platformed that they were
[1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:24.360]  really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:30.920]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:37.480]  but the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:43.800]  model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:48.600]  information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:53.560]  why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever

[1:45:55.800 --> 1:46:03.320]  beto roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:09.320]  rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:15.080]  hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:22.120]  their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:28.040]  incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now the supreme courts
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:33.480]  come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do
[1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:37.640]  using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under such incredible
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:43.800]  attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:47.960]  and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution and they're not going to
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:53.240]  help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:47:05.720]  could ignore all your unconstitutional laws you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:18.280]  from the front lines of the information war it's owens shroyer you're listening to the alex jones
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:32.440]  show all right let's take a look at the latest in the democrat coup the deep state coup against
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:37.960]  president trump against america but let's paint the backdrop for all of this
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:47.640]  s and p 500 rises for a fourth straight day hits record high and in fact if i'm
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:54.200]  recalling correctly crew see if you can find this for me i believe we've had now i guess now it would
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:48:04.200]  be more so what i guess 115 stock market records since trump has been in office see if we get a
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:08.840]  number on that is 114 i think at the start of the week but we've had new records since then so you
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:18.520]  know just record stock market record economic growth record low unemployment so the economy
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:22.360]  i mean you can say oh it's booming it's not booming people tend to be triggered by the word
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:29.160]  booming point is the economy is working it's going the right direction trump is doing what
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:37.000]  needs to be done to get that done so just record economy numbers keep coming in keep coming in
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.440]  keep coming in but the democrats keep posing trump as some anti-american operative or some russian
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:49.400]  operative even though he's giving russia's biggest enemy ukraine the javelin missiles
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:54.680]  that obama didn't and then they say there was quid pro quo and the trump administration when
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:59.480]  there wasn't but there wasn't in the obama administration with joe biden when there was
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:08.600]  so that's the backdrop for everything that i'm going to give you right now cnn poll
[1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:12.360]  why is this so important well we know that cnn polls are fake
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:16.920]  like they say 50 of people want trump impeach that's fake they pulled
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:24.440]  out of 100 people 90 of them died in the world democrats probably 80 of them rabbit anti-trumpers
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:29.080]  and then even of the 80 of the rampant anti-trumpers only 50 of them want him impeached
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:36.280]  but so why is that important well because their hearings aren't working
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:44.040]  that's what it tells you their hearings aren't working adam schiff and his
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:55.480]  lies are not working but it doesn't matter dem's move rapidly on impeachment with first judiciary
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:50:03.880]  committee meeting oh so now nadler who's had a couple weeks off to give schiff center stage in
[1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:13.240]  the impeachment fake impeachment coup circus nadler Humpty Dumpty is back and so now it will
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:20.120]  go from the bug-eyed pencil neck freak to the Humpty Dumpty fupa i feel bad for his tailor
[1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:24.520]  circumference of the globe jerry nadler
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:33.240]  but they're setting dates they're getting more impeachment papers ready they're on a reason
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:37.160]  number 10 it doesn't matter they have no information the Mueller report didn't work
[1:50:37.160 --> 1:50:44.520]  remember last year around this time they released a it's how did it go what was the
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:52.920]  Mueller Christmas thing that uh they they released a Mueller Christmas carol how Mueller was going
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:59.480]  to deliver this year and impeachment was going to happen in the year 2019 so it won't matter
[1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:07.320]  they'll keep going and and this headline is indicative of much more than is in the story
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:12.840]  impeachment cloud darkens trump's florida thanksgiving break well no it's all about the
[1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:18.520]  quote-unquote impeachment cloud darkening america destroying america tearing this country apart
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:26.040]  and then it goes on on the thanksgiving menu turkey with a side of impeachment they want you
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:30.600]  in fighting inside your family they want you tearing apart your family over this impeachment
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:35.560]  they want it to tear american families apart they want it to tear america apart they want it to
[1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:42.920]  darken these times they don't want anybody to be happy they don't even want you to love america
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:48.600]  and love your family over thanksgiving and that's why they send camera crews out to colleges and
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:58.040]  the college students say yeah thanksgivings racist and bigoted and unethical this is what they've done
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:07.960]  now this is the left and they're glad because misery loves company democrats push impeachment to
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:13.640]  next phase with december 4th hearing so they give you the date they hype you up they send your
[1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:17.880]  college students into the liberal indoctrination centers called universities and then they send
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:22.680]  them home pumped full of all this propaganda to go back during thanksgiving and tell you how
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:30.200]  bad trump is tell you how bad you are tell you how much america sucks and you're like wow great
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:35.640]  to have you home how's that turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes and gravy can you believe
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:41.160]  that trump isn't impeached yet ah like all right thanks college great job
[1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:51.400]  but you see the cold civil war happening doj moves to halt judges ruling that megan must testify
[1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:58.360]  so you have the obama harvard judge jackson no not berman jackson not that corrupt judge a different
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:06.040]  corrupt judge can tinge jackson so again it's the obama deep state corrupt court
[1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:15.560]  targeting trump doing anything they can all their last test of testimonies didn't work with
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:17.880]  you can't even remember them all vindman
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:25.000]  Fiona hill i mean who are these people they're irrelevant they're nothing so now they go for
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:31.080]  don mcgan now they're gonna try to get don mcgan and so an obama judge just says don mcgan you must
[1:53:31.080 --> 1:53:37.880]  testify and it's just like what who why doesn't matter don mcgan must testify i'm an obama judge
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:45.480]  i'm a dictate and i say mcgan must testify and this is totally out of the realm of of power
[1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:51.000]  but it doesn't matter it's an obama leftist judge they're authoritarian so then the doj steps in
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:59.160]  and says now hold on no mcgan doesn't have to testify you can't just dictate that anybody and
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:04.200]  everybody must testify because of your own political agenda you cannot do that you don't have the power
[1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:13.880]  and so the department of justice did its job and said no one judge is not a dictator one judge
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:19.240]  cannot just say anybody must testify in some fake impeachment scam that has no ground
[1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:30.360]  but it goes on you have the state of new york and all the anti trumpers up there
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:38.200]  with the attorney general and the mayor the governor supreme court blocks subpoena for
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:44.680]  trump financial records yeah supreme court says no trump gets privacy you don't just get again
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:49.320]  you can't just go get anything you can't just dictate that the leftist thinks it's a dictatorship
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:52.440]  we declare we get trump's financial records
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:01.640]  supreme court says well no you don't we declare anybody we say must testify before
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:09.560]  adam schiff and jerry nadler uh no you don't who do you think you are you don't run this country
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:17.400]  but that's what it is they believe they run this country they believe they've been given the golden
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:26.040]  torch of social justice warship and they've taken this role way too seriously that's why they
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:33.640]  are liberal activists progressive activists from the bench posing as judges the prime example
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:43.480]  ruth vader ginsburg literally embodies a skexie literally is a skexie who won't give over the
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:52.200]  templar of power she can't even show up folks ruth vader ginsburg can't even write she's in a damn
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:59.800]  iron lung i mean hey may she rest in peace but like give it up i'm not saying she needs to die
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:04.360]  i'm saying you are not on the supreme court anymore you're not a supreme court justice
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:10.520]  you're posing as one of course ruth vader ginsburg was always posing as a supreme court justice
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:21.800]  when she was really a progressive activist from the aclu now she's posing as a liberal activist
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:29.240]  from the aclu on the bench when she's actually a skexie rotting in bed that's ruth vader ginsburg
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:35.960]  that is the embodiment of ruth vader ginsburg she's she's crumpling she's dying she has no power
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:45.320]  she has no strength she has nothing except the ceremonial power of her sitting on the supreme
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:56.280]  court in the program only she's not actually there it's like if you're at a football game and
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:02.200]  you're at the dalis cowboys game and the announcer comes on and says in the dalis cowboys quarterback
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:08.760]  dak presscott and then nobody runs on the field nobody's under center nobody's getting the ball
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:12.920]  on the snap nobody's handing the ball off to the running back nobody's throwing the ball to the
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:18.920]  receiver but oh no dak presscot's the quarterback of the cowboys didn't you see him out there
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:26.440]  he's not in the huddle boy dak presscott really looked good today didn't even show up that's
[1:57:26.440 --> 1:57:31.800]  ruth vader ginsburg but this is what the left has done folks so so it's it's nice that we see the
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:39.000]  totalitarian dictatorship that obama built in the political infrastructure for the left to to
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:44.520]  have but it's time for it to be shut down and if they won't relinquish it then by golly do it with

[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:20.920]  and now your host owin shroyer all right i mentioned this earlier but let's go to this now
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:29.320]  college students say it's not okay to celebrate thanksgiving yeah well i think the like
[2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:35.000]  thanksgiving has been misconstrued a lot um especially in textbooks and it's kind of just
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:40.600]  based off of the genocide of indigenous people um and i don't really think that we actually
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:44.120]  give him some action we just eat a bunch of food and it's just a bunch of capitalist bulls***
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:49.320]  we're here today at mccallister college a small christian private school in minnesota
[2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:55.880]  asking students if it's okay to celebrate thanksgiving oh leaning towards no i feel like with you know
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:01:02.520]  the historical context you know kind of the i don't know i feel bad awful oppression of you
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:07.560]  know indigenous people like the holiday this guy is really like praised by even a guy price
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:11.480]  eight are you a man you probably say uh things to like uphold you know i just don't want to say
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:18.040]  i'm a man original like the celebrating a feast really isn't do i have to be the one that asks
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:24.520]  notions of all right i'm not asking what the actual holiday was well i mean the entire thing
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:30.520]  is sort of based off of uh indigenous peoples and the murder of indigenous peoples in history
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:36.600]  not really but what do americans do except for it celebrate unethical holidays
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:43.800]  what other holidays are unethical columbus day i mean christmas break first people
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:48.360]  hold in this country were italians you imbo schools are celebrating as christmas break
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:54.600]  sure do you celebrate these holidays um more or less is it okay to celebrate thanksgiving
[2:01:56.680 --> 2:02:04.120]  um no yeah it's probably not as bad as christmas or you know i can't decide what's
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:09.560]  worth it worse is it that this is the embodiment of higher education in america or is it their
[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:15.800]  ignorance or what is the worst part about this i'm pretty anti-religious so i think that they're
[2:02:15.800 --> 2:02:20.600]  just like um why are you at a religious school then there's a church right over there it's true
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:28.520]  it's true it's a good point is it okay to celebrate thanksgiving um that's a good question i think i
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:33.320]  think it's okay as long as your values are in the right place so the history of the holidays
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:39.880]  obviously not the best um and it's very violent and oppressive but if you are celebrating like the
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:45.880]  value of gratefulness but you see all of this is aimed in one direction like you go look at any
[2:02:45.880 --> 2:02:50.200]  country's history i mean there's there's violence there's conquering i mean it's there's there's
[2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:54.760]  everything but see only america it's like only america has any of that in its history so america's
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:03:01.240]  bad mostly fine so the question we're asking is it okay to celebrate a thanksgiving holiday yes
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:04.920]  we've been hearing from a lot of students that they won't be celebrating thanksgiving because
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:11.720]  of the history of the holiday how do you respond to that um i see it i see it more as like a time
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:17.080]  to spend like time with your family and like to enjoy like being together and be thankful for that
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:22.040]  rather than for like what the actual history of it is all right is it okay to celebrate thanksgiving
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:28.600]  i would think it depends just because all the education that we've gotten in public school
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:34.520]  has only told like the side of the story from like the white colonizers so what do you think
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:40.200]  the real colonizer i think the real thanksgiving story i don't know what it is because i wasn't
[2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:44.920]  there and because i don't have the all the historical information i mean the public
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:49.480]  school education tells you that thanksgiving was this great meeting where you know the native
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:54.040]  americans this is hilarious this is not even true where did they get this indoctrination
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:59.320]  from the public schools i guarantee you they're not they're not getting this from their history
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:06.040]  lessons at this university or there's a lot of american holidays in which like we which are based
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:09.560]  on like our oppression of other people it's like if that's the case that we shouldn't celebrate the
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:13.800]  fourth of july or like a lot of other holidays yeah independence for the individual self-government
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:18.280]  yeah throwing throwing a dictatorship king out of power yeah even on the religious get time off
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:22.760]  for that so like that's just like a slopey slope at the end of the day yeah yeah how do you plan
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:27.320]  to celebrate thanksgiving this year eating with my family yes eating with my family watching football
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:35.160]  that's just a joke it's just sad how indoctrinated these college students have been you know i'll
[2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:43.160]  never forget my professor's name dr mary ellen mcvicker who who who taught part of her history
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:48.200]  course was how you have been lied to about history but like the lies that the public school tells you
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:53.320]  like those kids believe it was it was the greatest class ever took the best it was real history
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:05:05.880]  a question was once posed to thomas jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:12.520]  take humanity too how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which other
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:21.640]  men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit
[2:05:22.840 --> 2:05:29.400]  we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:35.000]  will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all these rules for us about
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:42.280]  speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't
[2:05:42.280 --> 2:05:49.000]  want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band clapping universities the us of
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:54.360]  band 21 guns salutes for veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[2:05:57.160 --> 2:06:03.640]  we now take you live to the central texas commenced over and the heart of the resistance

[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:43.640]  supreme court blocks the peanut for trump financial records the point is the democrats are doing

[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:53.160]  donald trump and so it will ultimately land on the supreme court's docket to say can they do this
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:58.040]  does donald trump have any rights can the democrats just do anything they want subpoena
[2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:03.000]  anyone they want call anyone they want to testify subpoena any records they want from trump shut
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.960]  down anything that trump has ever set foot in or runs do they have all these rights and of course
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:17.080]  the answer is no but that's the point can the supreme court remain a neutral arbiter of justice
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:26.120]  or will it be totally corrupt by the left just like everything else the left touch touches becomes
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:41.320]  corrupt and yes this will be a pivotal moment for the united states of america to keep a fair and
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:54.120]  balanced supreme court that isn't dominated by liberal progressive politics where they promote
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:11:59.800]  progressive ideologues and activists to the bench to pose as judges like ruth bader ginsberg
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:09.080]  who won't even step down from the chair that she cannot fill it is an abomination but again
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:14.600]  i want the whole scene if you can i mean i'm not the crew does everything on a dime here
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:23.560]  but it's like ruth bader ginsberg is the skexie just literally disintegrating in front of everyone's
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:29.960]  eyes but refusing to give up the template or power that's ruth bader ginsberg because it's all about
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:39.240]  power it's not about grace it's not about dignity it's not about justice it's about power if ruth
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:48.040]  bader ginsberg had any dignity had any integrity had any grace she would step down but all ruth
[2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:56.680]  bader ginsberg cares about is power and the skexie lookalike is just a physical embodiment
[2:12:56.680 --> 2:13:06.440]  of what the left is they're a dying decapitated ugly husk they're a violent activist political
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:14.600]  ideologue wing posing as everything else but that as a justice as a president as a news reporter
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:23.160]  as a protester no you're all just left-wing progressive ideologue psychopaths totalitarian
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:34.440]  control freaks you just pose as all those other identities but look at john bolton now us national
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:43.480]  security under attack from within oh yes no john that was you but of course he's insinuating it's
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:50.920]  donald trump no war mustache you were the one that wanted increased intervention in syria
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:59.400]  over fake news that was you that was you john bolton anonymous author pledges to reveal identity
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:05.320]  soon you know what i don't even believe it but it wouldn't even matter there'll be another a non
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:11.000]  author that comes out and then there'll be 10 more and then there'll be 10 more blazy fords i mean
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:19.080]  who knows what the left is going to bring out next i mean seriously like who knows what these it's
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:23.800]  going to be it's like it's like the circus i mean you're literally you're standing there you're
[2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:29.160]  watching a three-ring circus and it's like whoa an elephant and then it's like whoa an elephant that
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:34.840]  spins on its head and then it's like oh my gosh a tiger and it's like oh my gosh a tiger that just
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:40.280]  pretends to eat a human i mean you see that's what the democrats doing just shock and awe and shock
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:50.600]  and awe so who knows what the democrats are going to do next burn down buildings set trump tower on
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:56.840]  fire continue their malicious and vicious attacks of trump supporters on the streets
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:04.840]  continue the censorship on the internet continue all their lies and misinformation i mean who knows
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:13.480]  maybe adam schiff will literally put on a clown wig and a clown knows and testify as a whistleblower
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:18.120]  i wouldn't put anything past these people right now

[2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:21.640]  here you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:26.040 --> 2:20:27.960]  i'm in the twilight zone right now folks
[2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:35.800]  i see the left in a total cult mentality then projecting their conservatives and
[2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:42.840]  trump supporters are in a cult we've all seen what's happened with uh you know to put just two
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:49.000]  names on it charlie kerrck and nick fuentes or you could say tp usa and the groepers
[2:20:50.760 --> 2:20:58.920]  but i swear i i i'm just i'm a little confused right now so the story comes out
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:04.120]  chick filet's charity director donated to the presidential campaigns of hillary clinton and
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:09.800]  barack obama and then i guess chick filet is now donating to the southern poverty law center and
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:18.840]  other such groups and then they also said they would stop donating to uh anti lgbtq people so
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:22.360]  i guess that means they were just donating to everyone and the left hated them for that
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:27.560]  and so then they catered to the leftist mob which didn't affect their bottom line at all because
[2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:33.800]  they were still the number one fast food chain in america but did it anyway then they come out
[2:21:34.440 --> 2:21:39.560]  and conservatives get mad because they basically cater to the left now and not the conservatives
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:44.680]  that made them the number one fast food restaurant but but here's why i'm tying the issue of uh charlie
[2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:52.360]  kerrck and the groepers to this to this chick filet story charlie kerrck tweets this out
[2:21:53.160 --> 2:21:58.600]  chick filet betrayed us we stood by them for years during every attack and controversy
[2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:01.880]  despite this they announced they will no longer support christian organizations
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:08.120]  even worse it has come out they support the southern poverty law center no more chick filet ever
[2:22:08.120 --> 2:22:11.640]  so i guess you'll never see charlie kerrck at a chick filet again if you believe that but
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:18.120]  i'm confused because wasn't it charlie kerrck the one bringing in the lgbtq agenda to the
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:25.640]  conservative movement and now he's pissed that chick filet uh isn't standing up against the
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:30.280]  lgbtq movement i'm sorry that is just a little confusing i think i've entered the twilight zone
[2:22:30.280 --> 2:22:40.840]  here uh maybe the groepers can figure that one out because uh i'm just a little confused by
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:48.600]  that one so uh we'll see if the groepers can get on that all right i've got the lines lit up
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:54.760]  right now so let's take your calls for the next two segments before alex jones joins us back and
[2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:58.360]  then the callers i don't get to if you want to call back into the war room i'll take calls then
[2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:05.720]  let's go to connor in indiana to start us off go ahead hey oh and uh what do you think about uh
[2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:13.480]  rocky trump boa oh well did you see the washington post reported that's a doctored photo so even though
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:18.600]  you know everyone's probably seen the rocky movie and recognize syvestre's talon is rocky with the
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:25.240]  steroid body and then the photos obviously photoshopped with trump's head uh i i was just a little
[2:23:25.240 --> 2:23:31.640]  confused and i'm glad the washington post points out that is a doctored photo well he's he's gonna
[2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:37.480]  go down as a legend but uh to go to go back to what i called it was calling about i think to bypass
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:43.480]  the censorship and to really bolster trump or a clear landslide 2021 which i think you will already
[2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:49.320]  is um ending the federal prohibition on marijuana because if there's something that speaks to both
[2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:55.160]  sides i really think it's marijuana and like just like the um that he did the dog thing he signed
[2:23:55.160 --> 2:24:01.160]  the other day it's like turned leftist like they were like minimizing it and i think if he ended
[2:24:01.160 --> 2:24:05.720]  the prohibition on marijuana it would turn the leftist into hardcore prohibitionists overnight
[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:11.000]  well let's let's think politically on this issue because i have before
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:20.200]  or politically donald trump moving for the legalization of marijuana
[2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:29.720]  is such a strong move that it's really unmeasurable i think and i don't know how to explain this but
[2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:36.440]  it's like all those people out there that hate trump because they've been indoctrinated into
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:43.000]  this hatred by the media or their university professor or whatever will immediately love
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:49.400]  trump because at the end of the day they love their weed more than anything yeah and so trump can
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:25:02.840]  literally just like splice out all of that noise if he moves against or moves to legalize marijuana
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:08.040]  and then think about the youth vote that will turn out think about the the pothead vote that
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:12.680]  will turn out think about the people that just want freedom of choice maybe they don't even care
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:17.800]  but they just they're sick of the war on drugs it would be such a political move for trump to
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:23.080]  move to legalize marijuana i think it would put the 2020 election in his back pocket now
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:28.120]  i don't expect that to happen but that's just a response to your phone call connor thank you so
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:35.000]  much let's go to nick in michigan go ahead oh hey is that doctor is that photo of trump
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.480]  smoking a joint doctor i can't tell all right sorry nick go ahead you're right can you hear me
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:43.240]  right when i finally got a new phone seems like i always have trouble just calling in the show and
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:48.840]  not anyone else well i can hear you okay didn't know i might phone call it's a bit do want to
[2:25:48.840 --> 2:25:53.000]  say off topic just something i've been wanting to call in about for a while and just have a
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:58.200]  little bit to actually get through i'm just wondering if i have a worry in my heart uh you
[2:25:58.200 --> 2:26:02.840]  know i'm a trump supporter myself i voted for him just worried that you know he's not necessarily
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:07.320]  going to cross any of the real lines that are drawn in the sand between him and the deep state
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:13.560]  so it seems so far up to this point it's just been regards to uh getting anyone in trouble for
[2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:18.600]  what they've done hillary the bunch of them it's just been talk i know it's a lot of you know waiting
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:25.080]  on the proper process to do all this but if you compare trump to john kennedy at this point in
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:31.560]  administration you know what kennedy was probably i think he was at this point he had he had issued
[2:26:31.560 --> 2:26:38.760]  an order i think in october of 63 to withdraw troops in the vietnam war he crossed the the
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:44.920]  oil barons passed with the oil depletion rate to uh you know limit certain allowances on the
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:50.360]  oil so the oil barons were mad at him you know i will say this if you're if you're gonna if you're
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:56.760]  gonna compare trump and jfk all day long i think that you know you'll you'll reach your conclusions
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:01.160]  and i'm not trying to to put a damper on what you're saying however i would say this
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:06.680]  you know jfk obviously got assassinated by the deep state and they covered it up with the fbi
[2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:12.040]  and then the deep state got more entrenched and more confident than ever that they could do whatever
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:18.200]  they wanted so let's say trump's already recognized that and that's why he's not taking in the jfk
[2:27:18.200 --> 2:27:23.320]  approach i mean that's just to play the devil's advocate to your call of course yeah and i want
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:28.600]  to say that's that looks like i am a voter i want to vote again for him just you know the two main
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:34.440]  points i'd say are geoengineering and 5g really are two things that you you have to wonder are
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:38.280]  what the cause of the decline in our like you were talking about earlier the
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:44.680]  uh progression of our society we're not even meeting the reproductive rates well you know here
[2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:50.200]  here's what i'll say as far as the 5g stuff and some of that other stuff that we want more done
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:55.800]  from trump even the censorship well no i would say this like the 5g stuff i get it trump thinks
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:00.520]  it's big for the economy you know he's all about kind of progressing with tech and everything
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.720]  it's good for the economy he's a businessman so like for that i mean whatever he doesn't
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:10.200]  understand i guess he doesn't have a survival instinct like the survival of mankind literally
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:15.880]  that 5g could wipe us out but there's a weird like i would expect him to have more of a
[2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:21.000]  self-preservation instinct to do something about the censorship to but not even that to do something
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:25.960]  about the deep state even to do something about the criminals that shot jfk in the head and then
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:32.200]  bury it that's that's that's what worries me more than anything i get that the 5g is probably the
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:38.040]  bigger issue but i can also understand why trump misses it but if he doesn't have the
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:44.280]  self-preservation survival instinct to get these deep state criminals off of his neck
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:49.480]  and back and everything in between then you really wonder what's going on

[2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:25.960]  hi hey owin um nice to talk to you again you too um the first thing i got to say is y'all
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:31.880]  got to start mentioning that um white house petition to pardon roger stone i signed it
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:38.280]  everybody i could get the sign it signed it but it's just stagnated yeah believe me i know it's
[2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:44.840]  kind of like i mean look we're in a we're in a vortex a cyclone of information here and so we
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:50.760]  just try to keep up with it and it's almost impossible to even stay put on one main story
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:58.440]  even if we wanted to oh yeah i know and uh alex was talking earlier about automation i'd like to
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:04.760]  direct you and y'all at info wars and all the listeners to a short story called machine the
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:11.720]  machine stops from 1909 i forget who wrote it i'd have to look it up i read it recently
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:20.280]  uh very very telling thing there how about this one for a existential question
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:25.880]  it's beyond if a tree falls on the forest and no one's there to hear it doesn't make a sound
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:31.240]  let's say we bring in some ai automation and people sign on or whatever and then they think
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:35.560]  they're turning into machines and then literally it's the end of humanity we're instinct uh
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:43.160]  extinct there is no more humans does the universe even exist anymore that's a good question it really
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:52.920]  is i don't think so i think we're living avatars with god's spirit his soul shining through us
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:59.880]  experiencing this consciousness and if if we get shut down the whole thing shuts down oh yeah i mean
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:06.360]  revelation will tell you that you know after god's influence has gone for the world the world god is
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:13.800]  done and if it's not if it's not man's influence through god then there is none yeah exactly pretty
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:19.000]  much all right tyler well i don't know if that's where you wanted this call to go but that was

[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:27.000]  and i'm two weeks late from from two weeks ago i hear you brother i swear and it's just like
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:30.680]  alex said if he's you know and you've been preaching to it's like you know it
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:36.680]  it trump's got about a month a month if it doesn't drop within a month we can just kiss this all
[2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:43.400]  goodbye and here's the thing too like every human has the same instinct folks we're i mean work
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:47.720]  it's just like any project you have or something around the house you can ask your kids to do it
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:51.880]  your your husband to do it or you know something this if it doesn't get done you just end up doing
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:57.000]  it yourself okay and i don't know what that means but that's just a pattern of life thank you for
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:04.680]  the call uncle sam let me get another one in here let's go to uh liberal in new york go ahead liberal
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:11.560]  hey owen how's everything all right okay so i listened to your show quite a lot and yes i'm
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:17.000]  a liberal and i do take offense to some of the things that you say but my offense you
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:22.840]  yeah but hold on my question to you is do you think that trump has your food and the reason
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:30.200]  why i asked this owen last week um he renewed the patriot act and i haven't heard a peep out of
[2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:38.280]  info was a respect to that and that is something that should be of utmost importance i think that's
[2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:45.160]  a fair point i can't even say that i ever saw that or covered that if i wanted to be a trump
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:51.800]  lackey i would say well he'll use it uh for good but i won't do that absolutely not and i think one
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:57.080]  other thing owen i think that he has totally destroyed the ron paul movement when ron paul was
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:02.840]  running and when his message was strong he spoke about the federal reserve and now you see there's
[2:40:02.840 --> 2:40:08.760]  a marriage now between the federal reserve and the stock market and trump won't do anything with
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:14.040]  respect to the federal reserve because they're the ones propping up and propagating this fake
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:19.560]  stock market stuff that alex raged about years ago so what's rarely going on i think trump has
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:25.400]  really fooled you all well let me just say this because look i'm not in a cult and i think that
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:29.560]  you put fair points forward believe me if they've gone through your head they've gone through mine
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:35.560]  uh to comment on the patriot act thing because literally i haven't even seen this uh i can't
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:40.200]  even see this full story guys it kind of gets cut off i'm wondering if there was basically he passed
[2:40:40.200 --> 2:40:45.080]  this to cut some deal with the democrats to pass something else uh that's kind of my first thought
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:50.760]  on this but but uh again he's he's not like trump has ever spoken out against the patriot act um
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:58.920]  i will say this liberal in new york i and i have said this before trump is either the
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:03.480]  white knight and and all the corruption will be brought down and he'll eventually do it
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:08.840]  he's the dark knight and he'll have to fall and be the fall guy but all the corruption will
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:15.880]  eventually get exposed and cleared out or he's the dark prince and yes he has totally fooled us
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:19.880]  he's totally bamboozled us he's stolen our momentum and our energy to save america
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:25.960]  into something else entirely which is just uh the continued promotion of globalism
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:32.760]  which he's not doing politically uh or from his bully pulpit or even legislatively
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:38.520]  but when it comes to the 5g and some other things and the censorship we we wonder about that so so
[2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:42.760]  i i i said that he's either the white knight the dark knight or the dark prince do you think he's
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:49.320]  the dark prince so okay i i don't necessarily believe this i just want to force for conversation
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:56.920]  between conservatives and democrats and here's my last point before i jump over and since trump
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:02.440]  came into power i've seen a big divide conservatives can't talk to liberals anymore because they're
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:10.120]  only focused on trump from trump i'm not necessarily the important issues that keep that that we all
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:16.760]  fought for once upon a time um i still see perpetual wars i hear talk about him pulling troops out
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:21.000]  well look hey i got 30 sayers left and i think this has been a great call and you say liberals
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:24.920]  can't talk to conservatives anymore but i think that this conversation right here is proof to
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:31.560]  the opposite i think what you have is brainwashed pigeons humans with the iq of a pigeon that just
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:38.280]  are totally driven off of hatred that is derived from mainstream media lies that i think we would
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:43.800]  both agree on that but as far as the globalism and stopping the foreign wars i think trump has
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:49.240]  stopped the momentum there i think he has uh you know tried to bring troops troops home tried to
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:54.360]  stop the momentum of globalism does that mean he's perfect no but i think that's a fair call who is
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:43:02.680]  alex jones mainstream media calls him a conspiracy theorist fake news crazy and worst of all
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:08.680]  a fear monger but the only thing to truly fear is missing out on all the great specials at info

[2:43:54.840 --> 2:44:01.240]  infowarstore.com i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell you
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:07.320]  that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:13.640]  globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that
[2:44:13.640 --> 2:44:18.280]  when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:26.600]  take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:33.000]  whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:39.720]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:45.880]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:51.160]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:45:01.000]  more imperative and more vital than ever the anti defamation league is one of the most powerful
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:07.160]  globalist leftist anti-american organizations on the face of the planet and they have declared
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:14.520]  that info wars is public enemy number one they gave tim cook of apple an award specifically
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:20.120]  for deplatforming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:27.320]  and now they've had sasha bary cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:34.360]  do not turn full control over to the globalist adl and they've called for a complete purge of
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:40.200]  anyone promoting americana we are being demoralized we are being conquered and the enemy wants to shut
[2:45:40.200 --> 2:45:44.600]  info wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat their
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:50.200]  paradigm you have helped keep us on the air but now the attacks are more insane than ever so please

[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:00.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:24.440]  the pale faces are taking over they're everywhere now maybe cool it with the pale face talk dad
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:32.440]  what can we we can't say that now so so what are they called i think just white people white people
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:41.240]  but they're not white they're pale as this audience of informed activists know and are
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:48.200]  purely aware the highest levels of poisonous anti-human propaganda aren't in the news shows
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:52.200]  where they know people are paying more attention but they're in the entertainment programs where
[2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:57.400]  people are in a form of suspended disbelief and go into a dream state a daydream straight
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:02.920]  literally a close to dreaming state with their brainwaves and it's in that highly suggestible
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:09.560]  state that the real programming happens entertainment movies and shows and also in comedy programs
[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:15.000]  which the deep state admittedly programs heavily the late night shows saturday night live you name it
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:19.160]  so right now i'm going to hit a piece that aired this weekend and then at the start of the fourth
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:25.320]  hour i'm going to hit another one dealing with a nigerian phone scam type information
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:32.120]  and nigerian email scam type situations and they're spent on that but first let's get into
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:41.240]  the first thanksgiving there's a lot of embedded propaganda here but the white pilgrim goes to
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:46.440]  the native americans hut and there's an elder there that is suspicious and thinks it's a
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:52.120]  use for patient and invasion and takeover but the young ones know they're young and down and
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:57.960]  politically correct now of course the white pilgrim is a pedophile he wants to have sex
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.440]  with a 12 year old girl but the family is fine with that so you have normalization of that just
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:06.040]  this little thing they always want to throw in because that's the less religion is destruction
[2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:09.240]  of youth they can't kill them in the womb or outside the womb they certainly want to rape
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:14.200]  the hell out of them and destroy them that way so that that little box is checked off and then the
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:21.480]  white man is dirty and doesn't wash his hands it's implicated that he's trying to steal their food
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:27.480]  but the big message by the elder or the chief is that well he heard from a fox meaning fox news
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:33.800]  obviously but 400 years ago this would be a fox you know out the yard that these people are here
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:41.000]  to take over your land take over your resources and poison you with biological weapons laced into
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:46.920]  the blankets so let's just pull back from there and look at what's really happening the truth is
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:50.760]  when the pilgrims arrived here there's been other expeditions and they'd been at jonestown
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:55.560]  other areas murdered and eaten uh the native americans were a lot of different tribes that
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:49:59.080]  were constantly at war with each other and they would show up this is all in the history books
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:03.960]  and their own histories and demand that you ally with them and help kill their neighbor
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:08.520]  who they had ancient beefs with or they would kill you so the truth is they were just as war
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:13.800]  like as the europeans just as savage in fact in many cases more so humans all act the same
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:18.280]  so let's stop to put in the noble savage idea out there that they're all perfect and oh we
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:23.560]  stole all this stuff from them and all the rest of it also it wasn't for 200 years later about 180
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:29.240]  years later the french and indian war that there are letters from british soldiers and officers
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:33.400]  when they had smallpox and their blankets had pus all over them if there was a neighboring tribe
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:37.880]  that they were at war with yes they would leave the blankets for them to get them and to die
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:43.160]  absolute biological warfare going on uh the huns used to catapult to people with the black plague
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:47.640]  over the walls into chinese cities they should throw them down the wells the water wells yes biological
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:52.120]  warfare is about 6 000 years old that we know of okay that's just a fact so but the point is it's
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:57.640]  all that only white men do this and that and that white men are inherently bad but the truth is
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:02.040]  they're bringing in all these giant third world populations and weaponizing them and brainwashing
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:07.080]  them against america and against the west we've been taught to be open and have a christian ethos
[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:12.040]  that the pilgrims finally did realize martin luther king all of that martin luther king jr
[2:51:12.040 --> 2:51:17.720]  and now they're using that openness against us to fill all the migrant populations being brought in
[2:51:18.280 --> 2:51:23.640]  with hate for america and the whites are inherently bad so the truth is the whites did come and
[2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:27.320]  manifest destiny did take over the united states now everyone wants to get in here
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:31.880]  not that we're perfect but because of the christian renaissance ethos we have more freedom we have more
[2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:36.120]  wealth we have more power we have more medicine we have more success though as we become less
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:41.400]  truly christian that's all flying out the window as you know so i want to air this piece here and
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:46.600]  analyze it uh it's just that it's very funny because it's very true everyone knows you bring an
[2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:50.600]  outside group and if they don't assimilate and there's more of them than you they're going to
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:55.400]  conquer you well if they're conquering you with medicine and electricity and jet airplanes that's
[2:51:55.400 --> 2:51:59.400]  pretty cool right there was some superior country out there with better medicine better technology
[2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:05.720]  better people i'd move there okay if they're brown people that'd be great too i think brown people
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:12.440]  look good i like them but see we can't give up our ethos and we can't let the globalist demonize
[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:17.080]  western ethos because they want to replace it with the globalist system the globalist overwrite
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:23.320]  that's a post human extermination plan so here is that report owens-royal have more to say about it
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:27.880]  and then i'm going to get into the other piece they put out saturday uh and just the incredible
[2:52:27.880 --> 2:52:33.320]  propaganda within it so they're showing the irony of how we're saying we need a wall we need control
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:38.760]  who's coming in here and then they're implying that again that's racist and that's bad when really
[2:52:38.760 --> 2:52:42.760]  it is all about survival especially when the leftists are bringing in these populations
[2:52:42.760 --> 2:52:47.080]  and programming them against us that's really the problem with the equation here's the report
[2:52:47.720 --> 2:52:53.400]  wow this food is amazing mom yeah it sure is yes mrs hauntess the corn is very delicious well i'm
[2:52:53.400 --> 2:52:59.800]  glad you like it john but again our last name isn't hauntess yeah we don't have last names john

[2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:46.760]  i think just white people white people but they're not white they're pale

[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:16.920]  i think i have to excuse myself again oh sure okay babe grandpa you're being a bigot it's john
[2:55:16.920 --> 2:55:22.760]  okay that's the second time he's excused himself maybe because grandpa keeps freaking him out or
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:28.680]  maybe because he's stealing from us what john doesn't steal i'm just saying since those
[2:55:28.680 --> 2:55:36.920]  illegals showed up a lot of things have gone missing lately buffaloes land grandpa the pale

[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:55.640]  the fox he knows what's up he also said these illegals stop calling them illegals they're just
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:01.320]  regular hardworking people seeking refuge and since when is it our job to take care of this world's
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:12.840]  problems okay dad that's enough hey guys i should maybe get going boom dry again stop it john please

[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:23.560]  think my stomach is having a hard time digesting this food i saw some whole corn kernels in my
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:32.920]  stool and i specifically remember chewing them all yeah that happens to me too me too yeah it's
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:37.720]  something about the skin on the corn i think it doesn't break down oh but that doesn't make
[2:56:37.720 --> 2:56:45.240]  sense because it's only some of them in my stool right like three or four yes i saw exactly four
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:55.080]  just now in my stool and i saw three yesterday wow john i i guess we have a few things in common

[2:59:53.400 --> 2:59:59.960]  planned parenthood saves lives of a lot of pregnant women i went to catholic school for like
[2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:06.040]  12 years so i'm ready to fight but um i think that um planned parenthood is a lot of good for like
[3:00:06.040 --> 3:00:10.600]  just pregnant women and women in general does planned parenthood do good for babies lives
[3:00:10.600 --> 3:00:15.240]  who are terminated in their facilities well the baby's lives aren't terminated because they're not
[3:00:15.240 --> 3:00:20.120]  alive um they're still within the mother's capacity who has a right over her own body
[3:00:20.120 --> 3:00:27.480]  it does matter because you're ending a life um it's not a life when does it become a life um
[3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:32.040]  when it is born what do you think about communism do you like communism uh yes
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:45.720]  yes hello he's mad oh um it's just that like israel's like uh committing war crimes against
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:50.600]  palestinians meanwhile like ruckers is investing um millions of dollars in corporations that are
[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:58.040]  contributing to this to the war crimes yes ruckers is contributing to war crimes essentially yes by
[3:00:58.040 --> 3:01:03.400]  investing in companies like lockheed martin that are war profiteers um they're encouraging the behavior
[3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:08.680]  oh my god it's kind of like democrats and federal funding getting involved in planned
[3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:14.840]  parenthood they're funding genocide um i wouldn't say that because planned parenthood saves lives
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:19.800]  of a lot of pregnant women like even if we don't look at abortion at all um just think about like
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:25.880]  all if you were to be fun planned why would we completely not look at the number one profitable
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:30.200]  thing that planned parenthood does which is terminating lives why are we going to skip over
[3:01:30.200 --> 3:01:36.280]  that no let's talk about it um okay well i went to catholic school for like 12 years so i'm ready
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:42.200]  to fight but um i think that um planned parenthood is a lot of good for like just pregnant women and
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:47.640]  women in general like if you are unable to afford um if you're planning parenthood does good for
[3:01:47.640 --> 3:01:52.680]  pregnant women what about the babies that they terminate do they do good for them uh well they
[3:01:52.680 --> 3:01:58.200]  would do good for um women who also aren't pregnant just answer my question does planned
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:03.000]  parenthood do good for babies lives who are terminated in their facilities well the babies
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:08.200]  lives aren't terminated because they're not alive um they're still within the mother's capacity who
[3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:15.000]  has a right over her own body so they're not alive um i think that there is like a different
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:19.880]  definite alive is not a good word to use because a plant is alive but do you feel bad when you accidentally
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:27.480]  step on it personally i do yeah i love nature of all kinds yeah love me but are you comparing a human
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:35.000]  to a plant um kind of like a leech a leech uh yeah can you explain that one how is it a leech give me
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:39.960]  the definition of a leech and then kind of convince me that that's what a baby is um the baby is like
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:44.920]  just like sucking off the mother's nutrients similar to a leech latches onto your skin and
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:51.640]  can't leave especially in instances of rape or um like assault where the woman does not want to be
[3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:57.400]  pregnant it's unfair and triggering to her to have to carry that child to term what if the child was
[3:02:57.400 --> 3:03:03.320]  going to kill do you support abortion um if say no but what if the mother would have it's the mother
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:10.360]  or the baby when does that happen um often no no it doesn't no it doesn't it why doesn't that ever
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:16.920]  happen so when would that happen i'm not here with all the facts i'm just like there's not an
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:22.920]  instance where a termination has to happen because the mother's life is in danger where the baby can't
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:29.000]  be saved so an ectopic pregnancy is not one of those cases i'm sure you're referring to later
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:34.600]  terms of uh termination of pregnancies because the mother's life is in danger and that's not the case
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:41.800]  do you know how a late term abortion is carried out um i support late term abortion do you know
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:48.840]  how it's carried out um i don't it doesn't matter it does matter because you're ending a life um
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:56.440]  it it's not a life when does it become a life um when it is born so what is the magical is there
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:04:02.680]  magic in the air and the oxygen is oxygen magic for that baby to come out stop for the baby to
[3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:08.440]  come out the day after it was in the womb so it's born that what's in the air is that magic fairy
[3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:13.720]  does that makes it a person oh i've changed my mind it's actually when um the child can survive
[3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:18.920]  without the mother like without the mother's like helps like once the umbilical cord is cut and once
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:25.880]  the child is like breathing on its own and can like uh find nutrients not do you think the mother
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:32.200]  has a choice when the umbilical cord is not cut then um oh well like that's like sketchy because
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:36.360]  you're already like gonna cut it like it's already breathing once it comes out so once it starts
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:42.200]  like breathing so why does breathing make you a person but the day before when you're in the womb
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:47.000]  you're not do you remember being in the womb i don't remember breathing and getting my umbilical
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:51.560]  cord cut you're probably i don't know i think you're like on some crazy
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:59.240]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're gonna confiscate all your semi-automatic
[3:04:59.240 --> 3:05:05.240]  rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a
[3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:11.000]  hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:18.040]  their blue cities are literal craft poles covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and
[3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:24.360]  incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out
[3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:30.520]  and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms
[3:05:30.520 --> 3:05:35.400]  my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country is under such incredible attack but more and more
[3:05:36.040 --> 3:05:40.520]  towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're gonna follow
[3:05:40.520 --> 3:05:45.960]  the original bill of rights and constitution and they're not gonna help in the confiscation of guns
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:50.680]  so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional
[3:05:50.680 --> 3:06:01.640]  laws
[3:06:06.840 --> 3:06:14.360]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do nothing
[3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:22.120]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live to the central
[3:06:22.120 --> 3:06:34.280]  texas command center it's alex jones finally today here in the fourth hour i want to play
[3:06:34.280 --> 3:06:39.480]  another clip from saturday night live last weekend which is really very sad where they
[3:06:39.480 --> 3:06:44.040]  fictionalize what happens to a lot of people millions people every year men and women
[3:06:45.320 --> 3:06:49.160]  where they think that there's some online lover who really cares about them and that they just
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:54.600]  give them all this money and fly them to some meeting place that supposedly they're gonna
[3:06:54.600 --> 3:07:00.200]  have this great romance and so many people are desperate for love that this is what ends up
[3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:06.200]  happening but it's more expansive than this it's like the nigerian email or phone scams
[3:07:06.200 --> 3:07:09.720]  you want to believe that prince boo boo's college you want to believe your special day
[3:07:10.680 --> 3:07:13.480]  has come you want to believe that all these wonderful things are unfolding
[3:07:14.040 --> 3:07:17.320]  and then once they get the first amount of money from you you don't want to admit you've
[3:07:17.320 --> 3:07:21.880]  been conned so you stay in the game that's exactly what leftist are like believing in socialism
[3:07:22.440 --> 3:07:26.680]  believing in communism and being conned over and over again when it only works for the people
[3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:31.480]  that are running it and controlling it and real capitalism even with its corruption problems
[3:07:31.480 --> 3:07:35.800]  is light years better so i don't think this is very very funny i think it's very very sick
[3:07:35.800 --> 3:07:42.040]  i think it's very very sad uh and they make a joke out of it on saturday night live but
[3:07:42.040 --> 3:07:45.960]  nevertheless a lot of people laughing in the crowd are leftist and they're just as conned
[3:07:45.960 --> 3:07:52.680]  as this fictional character so here it is honey this has been a really special vacation thank you

[3:13:23.720 --> 3:13:28.680]  jumping in here for the rest of the fourth hour of the alex jones show today thanks for continuing
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:33.320]  with me we got a couple minutes to break so i thought i'd bring you the way thanksgiving would
[3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:39.160]  operate if leftists were the original colonists meeting the native american indians for the first
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:45.720]  time the first thing they would have done is force all the native american children to be
[3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:51.800]  mutilated and chemically castrated to eliminate males because of course being a male is bad
[3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:57.080]  they would have banned all the bows and arrows have confiscated those quote weapons of war
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:03.480]  of that era leading the native americans to starve to death and have to demand well free stuff from
[3:14:03.480 --> 3:14:09.800]  people like ocasio-cortez free stuff they would be offered by the leftist colonists who would say
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:16.120]  you shouldn't work your farms you shouldn't grow food why do you have to exert effort to grow your
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:20.680]  own food and be self-reliant no that's that's no longer necessary all you have to do is vote for
[3:14:20.680 --> 3:14:25.800]  us and we'll give you endless free stuff you just give up all your rights give up all your dignity
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:31.880]  give up your speech give up your communities to us let us rule your lives and you will have free
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:38.680]  stuff from us and of course the colonists if they were leftists would have banned all the native
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:43.400]  medicine from the american indians they would have said you can't use those herbs and those
[3:14:43.400 --> 3:14:49.400]  botanicals you have to buy prescription drugs and we have to vaccinate your indian children
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:54.120]  so they don't get sick oops i got sick from the vaccines now you have autistic native american
[3:14:54.120 --> 3:14:58.440]  children running around they're going to need more medication fortunately the leftist colonists
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:04.760]  globalists have new monopoly price medicine from the new food and drug administration to control
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:10.520]  your life control the chemicals that you're allowed to consume and make you give up all your wealth
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:14.280]  so that you can have more of their prescription medications that are driving you insane and
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:18.840]  collapsing your society that's what would have happened in the original thanksgiving if the
[3:15:18.840 --> 3:15:23.640]  colonists were the leftists oh and by the way there'd be all socialism and communism nobody
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:28.360]  would be able to keep their own crops that they grew from their own labor everyone would start
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:33.560]  the death society would collapse happy thanksgiving from the insane left that's what would have
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:39.640]  happened now with the comedy aside we've got some serious news and analysis coming up when we return
[3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:44.440]  after this quick break you're watching the alex jones show on the day before thanksgiving 2019

[3:19:56.200 --> 3:19:58.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:58.840 --> 3:20:08.840]  you
[3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:19.640]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:27.640]  let me give you another reason why you should pick up a water filter from the info war store
[3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:31.640]  right now this is breaking news we just published it today on natural news and i know everybody's
[3:20:31.640 --> 3:20:35.800]  running black friday specials and everything but info war store dot com helps support this
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:41.560]  network here's why you need a water filter new research finds that the neo nicotinoid pesticides
[3:20:41.560 --> 3:20:46.840]  when they leach into the water supply when they combine with the chlorine that's put into the
[3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:53.400]  water by your local city you know municipal water it creates a reaction an actual chemical reaction
[3:20:53.400 --> 3:21:01.240]  that then synthesizes new toxic chemicals that are over 300 times more toxic than the neo nic
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:06.360]  pesticides themselves now the neo nicks these are the pesticide chemicals that are wiping out
[3:21:06.360 --> 3:21:11.560]  pollinators devastating honey bees all across the world and these pesticides have been banned in
[3:21:11.560 --> 3:21:18.440]  some countries but guess what water filtration infrastructure in your local city does not remove
[3:21:18.440 --> 3:21:24.600]  neo nic pesticides from the water supply in fact other drugs like hormone replacement therapy drugs
[3:21:24.600 --> 3:21:30.200]  and birth control drugs these are not removed from the water by water treatment systems so they
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:36.200]  continue to persist in your tap water and then when the cities add the chlorine as i mentioned it then
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:42.280]  causes a reaction and it creates hundreds of times more hazardous toxic chemicals than what
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:47.880]  was originally there so if you're not filtering your tap water you know you're crazy i mean you've
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:53.240]  got to filter your tap water and right now the electro pure pro water filtration system is of
[3:21:53.240 --> 3:22:00.120]  course on sales a great deal at info wars store dot com do not drink unfiltered tap water period
[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:04.840]  don't do it and what's great about the electro pure filter system is of course it works without
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:10.600]  electricity so you can use it even if the grid goes down as people in california are finding
[3:22:10.600 --> 3:22:16.440]  out and there are various forms of that water filtration system and yes they remove chlorine
[3:22:16.440 --> 3:22:23.000]  and chlorine byproducts as well now you may know i own a lab we do a lot of water product testing
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:28.120]  in our laboratory we do pesticide and herbicide testing heavy metals testing all those things
[3:22:28.120 --> 3:22:34.200]  so you've got to protect yourself from those things or you will be slowly poisoned but getting to a
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:40.600]  bigger picture a news item here you know there's an effort to mass poison humanity it's an extermination
[3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:47.240]  effort and you've heard this term called decarbonize and ocasio-cortez has been using this term quite
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:53.400]  a lot like we have to decarbonize the economy or decarbonize the planet i want you to understand
[3:22:53.400 --> 3:23:01.400]  listen up the word decarbonize means depopulation because humans are carbon based life forms in
[3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:06.680]  fact all the animals on our planet are carbon based life forms all the plants are carbon based
[3:23:06.680 --> 3:23:13.480]  life forms i mean even the insects are carbon based life we are carbon based life planet and most
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:18.360]  life at least what scientists suspect would exist in the universe would have to be carbon based
[3:23:18.360 --> 3:23:23.240]  because of how the table of elements works how carbon works you know there's something really
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:28.920]  magical about those four double bonds that work in chemistry organic chemistry to create really
[3:23:28.920 --> 3:23:34.280]  functional molecules and proteins and all these other things even you know fatty acids and many
[3:23:34.280 --> 3:23:40.280]  other molecules i mean vitamin c is made out of carbon cannabinoids is made out of carbon a thc
[3:23:40.280 --> 3:23:45.880]  in in cannabis is made out of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen by the way but carbon is in all of
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:51.240]  this stuff we are carbon based life forms so when people like aoc come along and say we have to
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:58.680]  quote decarbonize what she's saying is she wants to exterminate the human population she wants to
[3:23:58.680 --> 3:24:05.800]  eliminate humans and here's what you need to know this censorship effort by the tech giants
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:11.640]  to now censor any discussion of the dangers of vaccines and vaccine ingredients or the dangers
[3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:18.520]  of gmo's or pesticides or chemotherapy for that matter fluoride or 5g this effort of censorship
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:26.120]  is not about just controlling your speech it's not just about politics it is about making sure
[3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:31.800]  that they the globalists can succeed in their depopulation agenda by making sure that no one
[3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:38.920]  can speak up against the extermination efforts as they are rolled out on an accelerated schedule
[3:24:39.560 --> 3:24:46.680]  decarbonizing our planet means depopulating the planet of humans and they have many means to achieve
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:52.600]  that not only is 5g a weapon system as you've seen here on info wars in many different interviews
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:58.200]  especially over the last couple of weeks i mean you had a guy on here who who disassembles you
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:02.360]  know electronics like street lights and lamps and things like that and they have weapon systems in
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:09.080]  them you've seen that here on info wars but the vaccines the vaccine infrastructure is going to
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:19.320]  be used to fake a a pandemic let's say to fake a viral outbreak demand everybody go get vaccinated
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:25.560]  against this false flag pandemic that isn't even real and then they will put the euthanasia drugs
[3:25:25.560 --> 3:25:30.200]  in the vaccines and then when people take the vaccines they will start having symptoms they
[3:25:30.200 --> 3:25:36.520]  will start dying and the media will say well look the pandemic is getting worse everybody better
[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:40.680]  really go get vaccinated and we better pass laws like they did in new york remember a few
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:45.800]  months ago to demand vaccination you have to be immunized or you can't walk down the sidewalk
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:50.520]  they did that in new york they did that to religious communities they're very you know
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:54.760]  conservative jewish community there in new york they said you have to vaccinate your children
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:00.360]  even if it's against your religion your philosophies even if it's against basic human rights why why are
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:05.800]  they pushing the vaccine mandates because they're going to have the euthanasia drugs in the vaccines
[3:26:05.800 --> 3:26:10.440]  people are going to start dropping dead and they'll say well gosh everybody better go get vaccinated
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:14.760]  because look the pandemic is getting worse and then you see how the cycle works the more people
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:18.840]  get vaccinated the more people drop dead and then the media hypes up oh the pandemic it's getting
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:24.040]  worse go get vaccinated and it's just it's the spiral of insanity and medical tyranny to the
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:29.640]  point where they will send law enforcement door to door to put a gun to your head and a needle in
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:34.920]  your arm and demand that you sacrifice your children to their injections and their toxic
[3:26:34.920 --> 3:26:42.360]  chemicals i call it forced mass euthanasia that's what's coming that's called decarbonization folks
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:47.080]  that's what ocasio-cortez really means when she says decarbonize that's what i'm talking about
[3:26:47.880 --> 3:26:52.280]  now they have multiple ways to kill you it's not just about vaccines also about 5g it's also about
[3:26:52.280 --> 3:26:56.360]  fluoride and it's about geoengineering it's about chemtrails all these different methods
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:01.160]  pesticides in the food toxic chemicals in your water supply like i just mentioned earlier all
[3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:08.760]  these toxins add up combined with guess what super bugs that are being spread by hospitals
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:13.160]  like that candida are a super bug that's been spreading all across america and other countries
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:18.200]  all around the world that is there are no drugs that can resist it nothing can stop it from the
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:23.000]  world of pharmaceuticals but there are many things that can stop it from the natural world
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:29.480]  natural remedies superfoods herbs essential oils there are so many things that can be
[3:27:29.480 --> 3:27:34.840]  effective against different viruses and different infections but you won't be allowed to talk about
[3:27:34.840 --> 3:27:40.440]  to talk about those things because the tech giants will say oh you're spreading disinformation
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:45.560]  the only official information is go get vaccinated with this euthanasia drug if you
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:52.120]  say anything else like hey wait a second maybe we could use i don't know these these special
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:57.640]  essential oils maybe we could use mms for something maybe we could eat right maybe we could have
[3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:02.440]  superfood nutrition maybe we could take iodine maybe we could do these other things instead
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:09.320]  of being injected with kill chemicals you will be censored you will be banned that's what the
[3:28:09.320 --> 3:28:15.560]  censorship is about it's not about controlling you it's about exterminating you i hope you
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:22.360]  understand this says leapfrog past censorship this is not censorship this is extermination
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:29.320]  you have been targeted for termination why because you are an alive awake thinking human being
[3:28:29.320 --> 3:28:35.400]  you can think for yourself so you are a threat to the establishment that once you dead if not
[3:28:35.400 --> 3:28:40.680]  misinformed first but they really want you dead and that's what decarbonization is all about when
[3:28:40.680 --> 3:28:45.480]  you hear that word understand it's about depopulation much more straight ahead stay with us

[3:31:53.560 --> 3:32:01.400]  by going to infowarstore.com a question was once posed to thomas deverson what is the level
[3:32:01.400 --> 3:32:09.880]  of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit
[3:32:09.880 --> 3:32:18.280]  and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no
[3:32:18.280 --> 3:32:26.360]  limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil
[3:32:26.360 --> 3:32:32.360]  doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very
[3:32:32.360 --> 3:32:39.880]  saint people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[3:32:39.880 --> 3:32:45.400]  and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[3:32:45.960 --> 3:32:52.200]  oxford's band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are
[3:32:52.200 --> 3:32:58.360]  dangerous cult leaders and it's you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:06.840 --> 3:33:15.960]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's mike adams you're listening to the alex
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:23.080]  jones show i'm wondering do these university students today realize how idiotic they sound
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:27.560]  when they are talking to katlyn bennett in in their interviews there's an amazing clip
[3:33:27.560 --> 3:33:32.200]  that info wars was running earlier they just blew my mind i mean when i was on college campus you
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:39.400]  know i went i went to a university have a four-year degree in technical writing uh our our phd
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:43.160]  instructors were serious about teaching us things now these students you know what they sound like i
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:49.480]  mean this girl talking to katlyn bennett if i could if i could even try try to mimic her voice
[3:33:49.480 --> 3:33:56.920]  it's like all right and babies aren't even they're not even alive until they're the harvesting seeds
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:34:04.360]  and nuts and corn it's like they they sound like complete imbeciles like oh my god babies aren't
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:10.120]  alive they're dead until we want them it's like are you kidding me seriously i'm sorry about the
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:16.120]  the bad uh attempt there but they sound like smiggle from lord of the ring he's like my precious
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:23.240]  babies are not precious at all we love them here i mean actually look like hobgoblins
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:28.520]  these people these these are college students they look like hobgoblins and they talk like
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:34.040]  smiggle and they are insane they are deranged and they don't even realize how stupid they sound
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:38.920]  because they're talking about the right to kill babies because they they can't survive on their
[3:34:38.920 --> 3:34:45.320]  own while these college students themselves are living off mommy and daddy and the the production
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:50.280]  of everybody else in society these students aren't living on their own they're borrowing money from
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:54.840]  other people they're borrowing tuition from mom and dad they're eating food that they'll have to pay
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:59.320]  for later they're taking out credit card debt girl you aren't living on your own yet you haven't
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:03.800]  produced anything for a society you're not self reliant so by your own logic doesn't that mean
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:09.800]  you would want to kill yourself i mean for god's sake people get a grip babies are alive the moment
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:17.080]  they're conceived and that's all through gestation they're alive they have consciousness they have
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:23.400]  a beating heart at you know 21 weeks or whatever it is they are alive and they want to live you
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:29.400]  have no right to kill them just because you think it's convenient for the mother you know you what
[3:35:29.400 --> 3:35:35.640]  murder is your convenience now is that the argument look i didn't even mean to get into this issue
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:41.240]  right now but if they are willing to murder their own babies these demonically possessed
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:46.040]  what do you even call them they're almost anti-humanists if they're willing to murder
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:51.320]  their own babies you think they give a hoot about murdering you or murdering trump or
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:56.920]  murdering veterans or or cops or murdering you know people just for being white or just for
[3:35:56.920 --> 3:36:02.680]  being male you know that's that's how violent these people are they are deranged they are lunatic
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:09.880]  they're mentally ill and they are now a product of the university disinformation de-education system
[3:36:09.880 --> 3:36:17.240]  that is teaching bigotry and violence and infanticide while they tell themselves oh we're tolerant
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:22.680]  we're the tolerant ones we're the loving compassionate ones it's so loving to murder your
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:29.240]  baby with an abortion center then harvest the organs for the good of medical science this is
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:35.400]  what they tell themselves they are insane in any other era we would have locked them up we would have
[3:36:35.400 --> 3:36:42.440]  put them in padded cells in straight jackets and condemn them for what they have become a scourge
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:50.840]  on humanity a danger to all living systems a serial killers of conscious aware human beings
[3:36:50.840 --> 3:36:54.280]  that's what they have become and that's what universities are turning out right now it's
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:37:01.560]  it's insane but that's just all right let me get to Hilary Clinton talking about how she wants to
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:08.680]  retire the president do you realize that that term retire the president that's a euphemism
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:15.400]  for killing people yeah because the clintons have retired dozens of people over i mean a hundred
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:20.600]  people probably over the last couple of decades i mean all those dead people in arkansas
[3:37:20.600 --> 3:37:26.280]  the former state troopers who were bodyguards that you know vince foster the former accountants
[3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:31.080]  of the clintons and it just goes on and on they've all been retired they've been retired in body bags
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:35.880]  and rolled down the hills and thrown into the trunks of cars and disappeared into the desert
[3:37:35.880 --> 3:37:39.960]  never to be seen from again there's a lot of retiring that's been going on thanks to the
[3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:45.720]  clintons now they want to retire trump yeah we know what that means it doesn't mean to get them out
[3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:50.760]  of office through a fair and free election it means that they want to take them out they want to kill
[3:37:50.760 --> 3:37:55.000]  them and frankly why should we be surprised because of what i just covered they want to
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:59.560]  kill their own babies they want to kill trump supporters they want to kill christians they
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:05.480]  hate veterans and police officers and trump supporters and conservatives they hate everybody
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:11.560]  except their own lunatic deranged mass mentally ill morons who we just heard from in that interview
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:17.000]  with katlyn bennett it's just amazing like can you imagine society if the only people left
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:22.520]  alive after all this supposed mass killing takes place if the only people left are leftists you
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:27.800]  know who would they find to hate them well don't worry they'd hate somebody now they hate women
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:31.800]  they used to be feminist but now they hate women the 2020 olympics is going to be a
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:37.880]  a transgender hulking harry mail contest in the women's categories it's going to be like women's
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:42.600]  everything is going to be like oh we're we're here to win and beat them and they're just strangling
[3:38:42.600 --> 3:38:50.280]  women out of every competition it's going to be a a testosterone fest of of women abuse
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:55.480]  at the the olympic level is what it's going to be i mean it's insane this is what the world has
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:01.480]  come to really are you serious so hillary wants to retire the president and i've got something
[3:39:01.480 --> 3:39:06.040]  to share with the president and any of his people who are listening today look president trump you
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:13.880]  will not win in 2020 if you don't restore free speech in america the tech giants are engaged in
[3:39:13.880 --> 3:39:20.120]  election fraud it is criminal racketeering its election meddling at a scale that we've never
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:25.560]  seen before in the history of this country don't forget that robert muhler in his supposed
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:32.040]  investigation he actually indicted russian companies claiming that they were meddling in
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:38.600]  u.s elections and committing quote fraud against the united states of america because they ran
[3:39:38.600 --> 3:39:43.560]  ads on facebook that's it they ran ads on facebook well if these russian companies
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:47.960]  committed fraud against the united states of america what does it mean when the tech giants
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:54.920]  like google and twitter and facebook and youtube they selectively censor all conservative voices
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:40:02.520]  pro trump voices pro border security channels all of this thing when they censor those people aren't
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:08.040]  aren't they engaged in election meddling and fraud at a level that the russian companies never
[3:40:08.040 --> 3:40:16.040]  could have even dreamed of achieving google is a criminal cartel engaged in a digital tyranny
[3:40:16.040 --> 3:40:22.760]  against the united states of america it is called treason when you have coordinated interference in
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:28.120]  elections in order to overthrow the government and destroy our constitutional republic that
[3:40:28.120 --> 3:40:33.880]  is treason these tech giants are engaged in treason and just like hillary clinton wants to
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:40.840]  quote retire the president of the united states the tech giants want to retire the first amendment
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:44.840]  and the second amendment and probably the fourth and fifth amendments as well they don't care about
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:48.120]  the third amendment they're not going to quarter troops in your home but they do care about the
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:53.560]  other amendments and they're trying to retire the constitution they're trying to retire america do
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:59.640]  you get it president trump do you understand you will not win you are overconfident i'm sorry to
[3:40:59.640 --> 3:41:06.680]  say you are way overconfident you cannot carry this country unless speech is restored so that we
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:13.800]  can engage in debates and conversations so that we can express our opinions freely and openly in
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:20.200]  the public squares of our time which is google facebook twitter and so on president trump you
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:24.920]  will lose this election you will lose and you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't do
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:29.560]  something about this tech giant censorship because the american people are being silenced they are
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:34.440]  being oppressed they're being slandered and smeared and defamed and demonetized and delisted
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:39.800]  all of this is happening because you president trump are for some ungodly reason that we can't
[3:41:39.800 --> 3:41:46.040]  figure out you are allowing this to take place get to action buddy get to action if we don't
[3:41:46.040 --> 3:41:50.440]  have our free speech restored we have lost this country you you haven't just lost the election
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:55.800]  we have lost the country we've lost the republic we've lost humanity because it's america and
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:42:01.400]  donald trump it is one of the last people fighting for humanity in our world president trump is a
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:08.680]  champion for humanity but even a champion can slip up and forget to do something really important
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:14.920]  and that is you've got to restore free speech on the tech giants or all is lost we those those of
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:20.040]  us who are have been trump supporters for so long we have sacrificed so much president trump
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:27.640]  to put you in power and keep you in power now you must return the favor and let us speak otherwise
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:32.840]  how can we speak up for you and your policies if we can't speak at all it really is that simple
[3:42:32.840 --> 3:42:37.320]  do something president trump restore freedom of speech if you want to stay in office and if you
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:41.560]  want to save america and go down in history as the greatest president since george washington
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:45.480]  which you can if you do this correctly mike adams here the health ranger will be back
[3:42:45.480 --> 3:42:49.960]  after this break with more analysis and news stay with us here on the alex jones show
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:58.040]  i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell you most of those really
[3:42:58.040 --> 3:43:04.280]  weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:10.280]  could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting
[3:43:10.280 --> 3:43:16.040]  us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:23.560]  air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[3:43:23.560 --> 3:43:28.840]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:35.560]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:41.720]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:47.000]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now

[3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:26.200]  but is only made in the lower intestine oh and what does it say it's fiber from a spectrum of

[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:56.920]  formula gut fusion it's amazing info warshore dot com there's a famous quote by marine court general
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:46:02.840]  in the korean war when three million chai coms had flooded across the border and surrounded
[3:46:02.840 --> 3:46:10.040]  the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:16.120]  and the general was told general we're completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all
[3:46:16.120 --> 3:46:23.240]  directions well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:28.920]  biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support but it's going to become more
[3:46:28.920 --> 3:46:35.800]  critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks
[3:46:35.800 --> 3:46:41.080]  all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistle
[3:46:41.080 --> 3:46:47.880]  blower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:58.440]  having its own platform that checkmates the globalist you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:04.920 --> 3:47:13.480]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:47:13.480 --> 3:47:19.960]  we wake up in the morning i recently took a fighting rifle course to brush up on my rifle
[3:47:19.960 --> 3:47:26.840]  skills and you know do like team movement combat tactics laying down fire cover fire all kinds of
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:34.040]  things and you know all these if you've ever taken a course in in rifle combat or or a fighting
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:38.520]  rifle as it's called from tactical response if you've ever taken one of these courses you notice
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:44.680]  that all the targets are shaped like human beings right so they have cardboard targets that are
[3:47:44.680 --> 3:47:50.600]  representations of humans and you have a target zone like oh this is the heart area right oh this is
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:55.640]  this is the occipital you know brain shot target area right here you know put that around right here
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:47:59.080]  on the bridge on the nose this is what you're taught because of course that that penetrates the
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:04.120]  brain quite nicely and gets that job done and stops bad guys from being able to continue assaulting
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:10.040]  you right so you know you learn that you don't shoot to hurt people you shoot to stop people
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:15.480]  and save people that's why you shoot you shoot to save a life in fact one of the lessons were
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:20.360]  taught is anytime before you pull the trigger ask yourself whose life am i about to save
[3:48:20.920 --> 3:48:26.280]  that's a key element of some of these courses but the reason i mentioned this is because i think
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:31.720]  we're shooting at the wrong targets i think we should have robot targets because i think the
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:37.480]  future of humanity is going to depend on learning how to kill robots we're going to have to lay out
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:41.320]  those robots going to have to put rounds through them and you better have some high caliber weapons
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:47.080]  why because the robots that are being introduced into the system right now will eventually turn
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:52.680]  on the humans it's not just science fiction not just a terminator movie the plan is to have robots
[3:48:52.680 --> 3:48:58.840]  replace humans the plan is to take humans out of the decision loop so that robots make the
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:05.480]  decisions and robots are programmed by evil globalists who are trying to achieve the decarbonization
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:11.800]  of humans remember that we just talked about that in the previous segment so robots are just another
[3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:18.840]  hard kill vector that will be unleashed on the world eventually to kill people and if you don't
[3:49:18.840 --> 3:49:26.040]  know how to kill robots then you may not be able to defend yourself against this non-living object
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:32.600]  that is coming at you with rifles you know they can mount rifles on these robots and and handguns
[3:49:32.600 --> 3:49:37.640]  and nine millimeter rounds and flamethrowers and things like that so all these people that are going
[3:49:37.640 --> 3:49:43.240]  wow these robots are so cool they're so intelligent it's such great engineering yeah until they put
[3:49:43.240 --> 3:49:47.240]  a rifle around through your face and then it's not so great is it maybe you should have learned
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:52.040]  how to kill that robot instead of learning how to build one think about that these are terminators
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:57.160]  that they're building and all of you out there who are cops and i support local law enforcement i
[3:49:57.160 --> 3:50:03.720]  understand the value of that thin blue line cops are by and large good people like firefighters
[3:50:03.720 --> 3:50:09.560]  are some of the best people i've ever met so many great people in society but you cops that are out
[3:50:09.560 --> 3:50:15.960]  there training side by side with these robots do you not realize those robots are going to kill you
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:22.280]  one day or replace you first maybe kill you if you refuse to leave the force they are training
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:27.800]  the robots to replace humans that's why the robots can climb upstairs that's why the robots
[3:50:27.800 --> 3:50:33.480]  have ballistics tracking systems that's why they have ballistics computers on board okay do you
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:39.240]  understand they can put a 300 win mag rifle on one of these robots and they can use a ballistics
[3:50:39.240 --> 3:50:46.120]  system to put fire on target at a thousand yards away before you even know what happened you won't
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:50.360]  even see the robot and you're already dead from it that's what they're doing these are terminator
[3:50:50.360 --> 3:50:55.080]  systems that they're rolling out in beta form right now and they only make them try to look like
[3:50:55.080 --> 3:51:00.760]  dogs because they want to trick you and to say oh they're so cute it's like woofy it's like a little
[3:51:00.760 --> 3:51:06.040]  woofy german separative friendly man's best friend robot no it isn't it's a terminator
[3:51:06.040 --> 3:51:10.520]  and you better learn how to kill it you better learn how to run it over with your truck you better
[3:51:10.520 --> 3:51:16.120]  learn how to have an emp weapon and disable it you better learn how to wrap ropes around its legs
[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:22.920]  like in the star wars movies and just topple that sucker stomp on it kill it tear it apart that's
[3:51:22.920 --> 3:51:28.280]  what you better learn how to do or you're going to die because these are not here to help humanity
[3:51:28.280 --> 3:51:33.880]  these are here to destroy humanity ai systems at some point will take over the robots
[3:51:33.880 --> 3:51:42.040]  ai it won't take long before ai decides hey these uh whoa these humans are crazy we the ai system we
[3:51:42.040 --> 3:51:47.640]  better make the decisions we better run society and guess what don't need all these quote useless
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:52.360]  eaters as the globalists call them the ai systems will say well we've decided that humans are
[3:51:52.360 --> 3:51:57.480]  expendable and it's time to get rid of them unleash the police robot dogs and all of a sudden they
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:52:03.720]  will turn on you again it's not science fiction so i ask you today do you know how to kill a robot
[3:52:03.720 --> 3:52:08.360]  now i'm not saying that you should you know destroy government property out of the blue
[3:52:08.360 --> 3:52:13.720]  you don't go blow up a robot factory like in you know the terminator movies no but you need to be
[3:52:13.720 --> 3:52:18.520]  able to defend yourself against a robot assault when that day comes that the robots turn against
[3:52:18.520 --> 3:52:25.080]  us all that day is coming ai systems are on the rise and the weaponization of robots has not been
[3:52:25.080 --> 3:52:30.760]  stopped there are no international laws now that really practically prevent the weaponization of
[3:52:30.760 --> 3:52:36.520]  robots and if you think those walking little police dogs are a problem wait till you see firearms on
[3:52:36.520 --> 3:52:42.360]  drones because i've seen that i've seen that and guess what they have drones that can fly i've seen
[3:52:42.360 --> 3:52:48.360]  this in texas they have drones that can fly at night and spot you with a thermal scope and as
[3:52:48.360 --> 3:52:54.120]  they are moving they can do a ballistics calculation to put fire in a target this big
[3:52:54.120 --> 3:52:59.240]  while they are moving at 40 miles an hour in the sky from a thousand yards of elevation
[3:52:59.240 --> 3:53:03.080]  so you can't even see them you don't even know what's happening all of a sudden it's just lead
[3:53:03.080 --> 3:53:08.440]  raining down from the sky all over you and your buddies or your family or whatever they want to
[3:53:08.440 --> 3:53:14.680]  take out i mean imagine if they did ruby ridge again but with drones you see or another wake
[3:53:14.680 --> 3:53:19.640]  go texas raid just gunning down innocent women and children which is what they did that's what the
[3:53:19.640 --> 3:53:25.240]  atf did back in the 1990s what was that 1993 i think they could do it with drones now and they
[3:53:25.240 --> 3:53:32.360]  will they'll do it with drones they'll do it with flying systems and and dog systems and donkey size
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:39.160]  systems you know uh carrier robot mules that have a secret compartment opens up and here comes a
[3:53:39.160 --> 3:53:44.040]  like a gatling gun it just guns you down you think they're not build that stuff give me a break
[3:53:44.040 --> 3:53:48.360]  of course they're building that stuff they already have that stuff come on wake up folks this is a
[3:53:48.360 --> 3:53:53.720]  real world they are here to destroy humanity why do you think they're unleashing all the 5g weapon
[3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:57.160]  systems yeah they're gonna have flame throwers on drones that's they're showing a video right now
[3:53:57.160 --> 3:54:02.920]  i've seen that too freaking frame flame throwers on drones okay and by the way that's not even
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:08.120]  illegal you can do that yourself right now if you wish but they exist they can fly right up your
[3:54:08.120 --> 3:54:14.040]  house and set it on fire they can put gunfire into the windows of your home they can track your car
[3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:18.680]  and they can put rounds on you the driver as you're driving down the highway at night you
[3:54:18.680 --> 3:54:25.560]  don't even see or hear any of these drones you better wake up folks the the era there was a time
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:31.640]  when governments wanted more population to exist they wanted more people to run more factories to
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:36.840]  generate more economic productivity to have more tax revenue right they had more people to work more
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:43.480]  farms and so on that era was like the 1940s and 1950s maybe the 1960s today they got enough people
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:48.120]  to run everything they don't need you anymore they have too many people in fact the united
[3:54:48.120 --> 3:54:54.200]  states of america as a government cannot continue to exist financially if it has to meet its
[3:54:54.200 --> 3:55:00.040]  entitlement obligations that it's already made the government can't afford to pay out what it
[3:55:00.040 --> 3:55:06.520]  owes the retirees and the social security and the medicare recipients can't afford to pay it
[3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:10.760]  guess what the plan is is the government going to go broke and dissolve itself and say sorry we
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:15.800]  couldn't we broke our promises we'll leave and let you run thing no the government's going to say
[3:55:15.800 --> 3:55:21.080]  oh they want to find a way to get rid of all the recipients of those entitlements so they don't

[3:56:15.720 --> 3:56:22.920]  by the way or or you know 338 lapua magnums there are ways to kill robots there are ways to deceive
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:28.360]  robots so they can't scan you you know put on thermal protection devices for example or you
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:32.600]  can blind their sensors with powerful lasers that's another thing go get some of those powerful
[3:56:32.600 --> 3:56:37.800]  green lasers and uv lasers and prepare to blind those robots and just knock out their sensory
[3:56:37.800 --> 3:56:42.040]  systems and then when they fall over then you go stomp on them and put rounds through them that's
