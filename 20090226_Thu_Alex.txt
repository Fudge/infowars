[10:08.520 --> 10:14.520]  recession slashing taxes no tax increases because when Kennedy cut federal
[10:14.520 --> 10:20.880]  taxes by 50% the treasury amount of money coming in doubled people spend more
[10:20.880 --> 10:25.960]  money in the economy explodes they want to kill the economy they know what

[10:36.200 --> 10:40.080]  this is Bloomberg plans to apply the same small government policies when he
[10:40.080 --> 10:43.480]  becomes Israel Prime Minister as he did six years ago as finance minister then
[10:43.480 --> 10:49.840]  his tax and spending cuts helped lift the economy out of recession they may be
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.480]  less suitable this time around the Likud party leader who has until April 3 to
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.120]  form a coalition faces a shrinking economy growing budget deficit and a
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.880]  frozen corporate bond tax the recession in the US and Europe has clobbered
[11:02.880 --> 11:05.720]  Israel's exports which account for about half the gross domestic product in the
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.360]  country whose economy is smaller than Singapore's his only fiscal tool for
[11:10.360 --> 11:15.880]  the government is a budget drawn up in August installed in the parliament the
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.560]  Knesset Israel must take steps in the spirit the US and Europe to allow even
[11:20.560 --> 11:25.720]  bigger deficit said AV Ben Bassett a professor of economics at Hebrew
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.840]  University in Jerusalem the situation requires a change in policy and his
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.480]  plans are huge tax cuts but the United States won't be getting those me you'll
[11:35.480 --> 11:43.200]  get $15 and something every two weeks I guess and then all the carbon taxes and
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.760]  regulations and attacks on the middle class which will then just shut down
[11:46.760 --> 11:54.600]  their businesses you'll lose your job but hey it's fun Reuters reports financial
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.080]  crisis sparks unrest in Europe we're getting to that Bernanke again spurs
[11:59.080 --> 12:02.760]  talk of bank nationalization because they got to drive that bank stock down more
[12:02.760 --> 12:06.320]  so they can consolidate it got a bad mouth that economy and engage in
[12:06.320 --> 12:13.440]  financial terrorism Obama forecast 1.75 trillion deficit this year and he
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.520]  wants the biggest supplementary funding to the over one trillion dollar
[12:17.520 --> 12:22.600]  defense budget up from 600 billion with a supplemental of 800 plus billion
[12:22.600 --> 12:32.320]  dollars Obama's war machine needs 800 billion for 2009 supplemental that's on
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.400]  top of it so I guess the defense budget with some other added things will be
[12:35.400 --> 12:43.400]  1 trillion 900 billion dollars Ron Paul grills Bernanke you can't reinflate the
[12:43.400 --> 12:47.840]  bubble I'm gonna play that clip a little bit later octuplet mom I knew this was
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.520]  coming fears hospital may not release babies and then in the article they say
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.480]  yeah the hospital's looking at using the CPS because maybe she can't take care of
[12:55.480 --> 12:59.160]  a baby see I mean it's all about just first they demonize the woman in the
[12:59.160 --> 13:02.600]  news and say how dare I have all these children it's hurting the economy as if
[13:02.600 --> 13:08.160]  children on our future and don't fund the economy later and I knew they were
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.960]  setting her up for this so they'll have a big public event for you to sell having
[13:11.960 --> 13:17.480]  the state take your children CIA adds economy to threat updates I mean they're
[13:17.480 --> 13:21.240]  the ones Wall Street founded the CIA out of skull and bones are the ones running
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.160]  all this so they've got a now grandstand as our savers get involved
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.440]  domestically Princeton physicist tells Congress Earth is co2 famine which it
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.040]  is increase will be good for mankind business and media institute and a
[13:34.040 --> 13:40.080]  powerful member of the liberal MPs of all people was challenging the leader of
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.600]  his party because he's a scientist he says humans not causing climate change
[13:43.600 --> 13:50.080]  look at Hitler and he ties it into Hitler I think very well done I've got
[13:50.080 --> 13:54.160]  all these photos and images we were just looking at yesterday and today of Obama
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.000]  all over the world shown as the Christ is Jesus he's now more popular in polls
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.440]  than Jesus meanwhile this is the type of fluff they're feeding the public out of
[14:05.440 --> 14:09.600]  the sun sex mad Russian died after guzzling a bottle of Viagra pills to
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.920]  keep him going for 12 hour orgy with two women pals is the kind of stuff they
[14:14.920 --> 14:24.400]  put in the news distract the public so that is some of what is coming up today
[14:26.320 --> 14:36.200]  major newspapers like the London Times and others in the 1776 period wrote
[14:36.200 --> 14:39.480]  about how horrible it would be if we were allowed to set up our own country
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.160]  outside their banking system and how horrible it was that later a decade
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.440]  later with the Bill of Rights that there was a second amendment and that if the
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.120]  idea of people being able to be armed spread the surface of Europe would no
[14:54.120 --> 14:58.400]  longer be slaves now remember the first gun laws were against blacks in this
[14:58.400 --> 15:02.400]  country after they were freed they began buying firearms and defending
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.480]  themselves from the lynchers and the slave masters and the people who wanted
[15:05.480 --> 15:08.880]  to burn them out they would get jealous whenever blacks started their own
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.200]  businesses despite a lot of oppression and things that went on there were a lot
[15:14.200 --> 15:20.880]  of lights like the majority that worked happily with blacks and so some of the
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.080]  first big cotton gen operations and tanneries and businesses were owned and
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.920]  run by blacks and they'd burn them out they'd kill them and the blacks started
[15:32.920 --> 15:38.520]  fighting back so they passed laws to take their guns and of course Native
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.440]  Americans were disarmed slaves are disarmed you know Pol Potts has turned
[15:42.440 --> 15:48.160]  your firearms in public turns them in he slaughters 35% of Cambodia's population
[15:48.160 --> 15:50.840]  in the next few years
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.520]  Obama to seek new assault weapons ban but when you read the ABC news article and
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.720]  more see they're gonna call it a reauthorization of the assault weapons
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.240]  ban but they're going to physically ban them he wants that new power in the
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.040]  bills they've introduced we've read those bill numbers on air it's in the
[16:11.040 --> 16:20.920]  Obama deception film it'll be done Sunday hallelujah and it's happening I've
[16:20.920 --> 16:27.080]  got a clip of Obama it's on YouTube where he says look I'm for reasonable gun
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.120]  control we're not gonna ban all your guns overnight we're just gonna do it in
[16:32.120 --> 16:39.440]  steps and they want a shooting war they want a physical fight they know that
[16:39.440 --> 16:45.520]  there's a large percentage of gun owners who will not turn their guns in and
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.760]  they want dead cops and dead military and dead citizens you know what Holder
[16:51.760 --> 16:54.040]  does in here and I told you they were gonna do this it's in the security and
[16:54.040 --> 16:57.800]  prosperity partnership plans that judicial watch sued two years ago and
[16:57.800 --> 17:02.840]  got said in game blueprint for global enslavement they stayed in there they're
[17:02.840 --> 17:06.800]  gonna use the collapsing economy and economic crises and influx of refugees
[17:06.800 --> 17:13.240]  from Mexico to bring in the SPP and now they're saying oh we've got to have a
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.440]  continuous border with Mexico and Canada we've got to merge the two you'll have a
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.720]  inner North American Union passport they've now rolled that out people are
[17:21.720 --> 17:26.480]  getting it has a tracker chip in it the Mexicans are to be given it the
[17:26.480 --> 17:30.560]  Canadians are to be given it and because they made drugs illegal it's a
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.360]  $400 billion industry and as I told you three years ago in Selle Castillo
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.160]  former head DE agent down there they were training Los Zetas and others under
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.920]  CIA control to go in and go after the four sub cartels and a few other mini
[17:42.920 --> 17:47.960]  cartels who only had about 30 40 depending on which numbers you look at
[17:47.960 --> 17:51.520]  percentage of the cocaine and heroin trade out of Mexico into the US that's
[17:51.520 --> 17:56.120]  the major conduit and so they started a war with the drug cartels knowing that
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.200]  it would totally bring Mexico down and then that the martial law would be

[25:43.760 --> 25:47.400]  but the establishment gives a counterfeit of that they say that's what
[25:47.400 --> 25:51.600]  they're doing but really they're creating division like Attorney General Eric
[25:51.600 --> 25:56.200]  Holder very wicked man coming out and saying Americans are cowards racially
[25:56.200 --> 26:03.800]  that was to re-inject racial tension because they don't want us to unite
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.600]  they want us to keep on fussing and fighting
[26:08.040 --> 26:13.280]  Obama to seek new assault weapons ban the ban expired in 2004 during the Bush
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.160]  administration the Obama administration will seek to reinstate the assault
[26:17.160 --> 26:20.800]  weapons ban that expired in 2004 during the Bush administration Attorney General
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.840]  Eric Holder said today as President Obama indicated during the campaign there
[26:25.840 --> 26:31.360]  are just a few gun related changes just a few that we would like to make and
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.840]  among them would be to reinstate the ban on the sale of assault weapons holder
[26:35.840 --> 26:43.480]  told reporters now remember right before he became chief of staff congressman
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.600]  Rahm Emanuel introduced bills to basically ban everything I mean folks this
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.360]  is happening right now holders said that putting the ban back in place would
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.160]  not only be positive move by the United States it would help cut down the flow
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.400]  of guns going across the border into Mexico why don't you defend the border
[27:00.400 --> 27:05.960]  trader most of the guns don't come from here that's why we need guns they got a
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.000]  gun ban in Mexico and look how they're falling apart like Chicago and New
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.360]  York and DC and you know that you want lawlessness so we've got to come to you
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.640]  and beg and be your slaves for protection just like the mob threatens to
[27:19.640 --> 27:22.680]  burn down your grocery store if you don't pay in protection money you're a
[27:22.680 --> 27:26.600]  mobster you're a dirty gangster
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.640]  it would help cut down the flow of guns across the border into Mexico which is
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.640]  struggling with heavy violence along drug cartels along the border I think
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.560]  that will have a positive impact on Mexico to minimum holders said at a news
[27:43.560 --> 27:48.200]  conference on the arrest of more than 700 people in a drug enforcement crackdown
[27:48.200 --> 27:52.440]  on Mexico's drug cartels operating the US they only arrest their competition by
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.040]  the way that's all this is publicly the globalist run a war with US troops in
[27:56.040 --> 28:01.160]  Columbia for over a decade trying to get the goodies the State Department
[28:01.160 --> 28:04.480]  travel warning issued February 20 2009 reflected government concerns about the
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.960]  violence so see how the news integrates what's happening in Mexico as if the
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.640]  Second Amendment did this when no one is allowed to own a gun but the corrupt
[28:13.640 --> 28:19.320]  scumbag police and military of Mexico you want to be a slave you're going to
[28:19.320 --> 28:26.160]  be folks some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels
[28:26.160 --> 28:33.200]  have resembled small unit combat with cartels employing automatic weapons and
[28:33.200 --> 28:41.040]  grenades set holder as if grenades are being sold in businesses this is pure
[28:41.040 --> 28:47.600]  horse crap the drug cartels mainly have heckler and coke machine guns from
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.760]  Germany that sold the military and then sold by the military the drug gangs
[28:53.280 --> 28:58.240]  resemble small unit combat with cartels employing automatic weapons and
[28:58.240 --> 29:03.280]  granados the warning said large firefights have taken place in many
[29:03.280 --> 29:06.320]  towns and cities across Mexico but most recently in northern Mexico including
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.200]  Tijuana Chihuahua
[29:12.040 --> 29:17.000]  Juarez at the news conference today holder described the discussions with
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.840]  Mexican counterpart about the recent spike in violence I met yesterday with
[29:20.840 --> 29:25.840]  Attorney General Medina Mora of Mexico and we'll discuss the unprecedented
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.280]  levels of violence this country is facing because of their enforcement
[29:29.280 --> 29:33.320]  efforts he said so he comes out and says we got a pass gun bans in America
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.360]  because of Mexico's we can live just like they do with a bunch of potbellied
[29:37.360 --> 29:41.040]  government scum ruling and taking everybody's property and just
[29:41.040 --> 29:45.840]  dominating everybody so we can live like people do in Chicago and New York and
[29:45.840 --> 29:55.560]  DC yeah piece of trash we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.560 --> 29:59.360]  and the GCN radio network

[33:23.360 --> 33:27.880]  danger to society they did the same thing they did to Randy Weaver they kept
[33:27.880 --> 33:32.880]  saying his buddy that you know mediment gun shows oh just sell me a shotgun just
[33:32.880 --> 33:36.560]  please sell me a shotgun he's a school teacher former police officer former DEA
[33:36.560 --> 33:41.080]  agent and he said okay here's the ship here's the rival boom they busted him
[33:41.080 --> 33:44.240]  turned out that that was staged they had to drop that case and they charge him
[33:44.240 --> 33:48.720]  with something else this is how they operate it's how they roll and he told
[33:48.720 --> 33:52.000]  us more than three years ago those YouTube videos and Google videos are
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.560]  everywhere I got out of the time to do this listeners it really helps us when
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.160]  you go out you heard the shows you remember them and find the shows from
[33:59.160 --> 34:05.160]  years ago where we say they're training CIA paramilitary Mexican commandos
[34:05.160 --> 34:10.160]  billions of dollars in south Texas to launch a huge drug war to take over the
[34:10.160 --> 34:16.560]  remaining cartels they mean to bring down Mexico and collapse it exactly what
[34:16.560 --> 34:24.160]  we told you is happening again because Celica still I was the most high-ranking
[34:24.160 --> 34:29.000]  DEA agent he was over about 50 officers in Central and South America he was over
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.840]  at all and he saw them flying the cocaine out of Alapango Airport and he
[34:33.840 --> 34:38.760]  blew the whistle he's been on Nightline you name it he's testified before
[34:38.760 --> 34:44.240]  Congress and they told him about a year and a half ago he on here he said yeah
[34:44.240 --> 34:47.520]  they've been threatening me they've been calling me they told me we're gonna get
[34:47.520 --> 34:55.400]  you then he exposed to the BATF in Texas gun shows where he sells his books on the
[34:55.400 --> 34:59.120]  weekend just to educate people he exposed that they have hidden cameras in
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.120]  the gun shows trying to set people up for not even breaking the law and they
[35:03.120 --> 35:08.520]  told him we're gonna get you so the Castillo we're gonna get you and when
[35:08.520 --> 35:12.400]  they pulled him over in the setup sting they said how dare you say the government
[35:12.400 --> 35:16.200]  deals the drugs you're going to prison
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.440]  you know any police that are in denial about the fact that over 80% of the
[35:23.440 --> 35:26.840]  heroin and cocaine brought into this nation is brought in by the CIA or by
[35:26.840 --> 35:34.440]  their licensed couriers then to be money laundered there's constantly ships
[35:34.440 --> 35:40.960]  and 18 wheelers and jets crashing full of cocaine and heroin and marijuana
[35:40.960 --> 35:47.600]  heroin you name it it's all over the news I mean there's so much of this stuff
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.040]  they're shipping over directly in CIA aircraft that there's been many cases of
[35:51.040 --> 35:57.880]  them crashing in the US and in Mexico and in Latin America you understand we
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.960]  have drug dealing criminals that run the government they want your guns they
[36:02.960 --> 36:10.640]  want to dominate you they want a tyranny they're gonna bankrupt the economy so
[36:10.640 --> 36:14.160]  bad that all the Kool-Aid drinkers are gonna be given government ID cards that
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.320]  government credits are put on as Homeland Security announced years ago and
[36:19.320 --> 36:28.240]  you're gonna have most the public on the government payroll with fiat money this
[36:28.240 --> 36:33.880]  is the equivalent of a Nazi slash Soviet slash Mal takeover but of the police
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.160]  and the military and the state say we know what you're doing we know your
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.440]  criminals we know your foreign bankers we know you don't even pay taxes you're
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.520]  so corrupt we know you're a private Federal Reserve and we just beat that
[36:45.520 --> 36:48.040]  drum and we know you're gonna folks I'm telling you right now I'm sure but
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.120]  they're gonna stage terror attacks soon I will be very surprised if they don't
[36:53.120 --> 36:57.840]  stage something big by the end of this year and then it's gonna be just full
[36:57.840 --> 37:03.120]  out federal worship on TV the terrorist hit us we're doing what we have to and I
[37:03.120 --> 37:07.920]  think it's gonna be al-qaeda type terrorists you operatives are gonna go
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.720]  into shopping malls and schools I think it's gonna be hundreds dead now just
[37:11.720 --> 37:15.840]  exposing this may stop it but all of their attack patterns their pre-programming
[37:15.840 --> 37:21.000]  their drills their ops tell me that is one of their main programs they've got
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.240]  that operation locked and loaded and pointed at the people's head Aaron
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.720]  Zelman just preservation firearms ownership head believes that Larry
[37:30.720 --> 37:33.840]  Pratt has told you he believes that I had congressman on that said they think
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.960]  they're gonna pull something but people in the know know that they stage most
[37:38.960 --> 37:45.000]  these things then they get copycats going after they hype it I don't want
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.840]  to explain something to the military and police and others even if you're
[37:47.840 --> 37:51.640]  reprobating I know most of your good that even if you're evil and want to go
[37:51.640 --> 37:55.600]  along with this you're gonna be hurt in the process as well this is gonna hurt
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.360]  your family and they are gonna take your pension funds just just know that if
[37:59.360 --> 38:02.920]  you stand up to these bankers and say no with this Psyop they're running we will
[38:02.920 --> 38:06.800]  defeat them but you got to have courage and you got to commit I don't want to
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.120]  hear you can lose your job I don't want to hear you can lose your business I
[38:10.120 --> 38:13.200]  don't want to hear what your neighbors think what the pastor think do you know
[38:13.200 --> 38:16.600]  all the things I've gone through the attacks the physical attacks the death
[38:16.600 --> 38:22.480]  threats the dirty tricks the money I've turned down you know with huge networks
[38:22.480 --> 38:26.440]  offering me incredible amounts of money a decade ago and then just a few years
[38:26.440 --> 38:35.600]  ago to join the new order team you know how many affiliates I lose because I
[38:35.600 --> 38:43.480]  won't mince words I won't back off I am committed to this and if you would just
[38:43.480 --> 38:50.680]  commit and get past your cowardice we would defeat the new world order overnight
[38:50.680 --> 38:57.720]  when they continue so they're hyping that Mexico's collapsing where they have a
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.000]  total gunband for the slaves that's what they call them down there the ruling
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.640]  elite of Mexico or mainly European go read the names on their Congress it's
[39:08.640 --> 39:17.800]  green and Swartz and it's incredible the name they have for their people down
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.440]  there is the cockroaches that that's what the racist government you know all of
[39:23.440 --> 39:28.240]  them six foot four six foot five white guys been down there you know Maximilian
[39:28.240 --> 39:34.960]  the German Empire the Austrian Hungarian Empire ruled Mexico Mexico I packed the
[39:34.960 --> 39:40.560]  United States during World War one they began an attack in World War two for
[39:40.560 --> 39:49.280]  Germany it's globalist run period meanwhile the European Union crowd that's
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.480]  what they were then even in the 40s attempted coup d'etat is here in the
[39:54.480 --> 39:59.720]  U.S. attempting to lead the Marine Corps to overthrow the government but the
[39:59.720 --> 40:07.200]  Marine Corps commander Major General Smedley Butler blew the whistle on it
[40:07.200 --> 40:12.920]  and it was good men that stopped this it was Fox Fallon I would even say is a
[40:12.920 --> 40:15.800]  good person but when they wanted him to stage terror attacks on his own ships a
[40:15.800 --> 40:19.520]  year ago when they wanted him to move the carriers in the missile range of
[40:19.520 --> 40:38.480]  Iran he resigned as the head of sitcom so let's continue if you cop out on this if
[40:38.480 --> 40:43.160]  you make excuses on this if you cower and don't give the maximum effort for
[40:43.160 --> 40:49.000]  liberty you will be destroyed don't you understand this isn't even courage this
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.160]  is self-preservation all you can do is fight all you can do is say no all you
[40:56.160 --> 40:59.120]  can do is resist
[41:02.200 --> 41:11.600]  continuing at the news conference today holder described his decisions
[41:11.600 --> 41:15.400]  discussions with Mexican counterpart about the recent spike in violence I
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.680]  met yesterday with Attorney General Medina Mora of Mexico we discussed the
[41:19.680 --> 41:22.240]  unprecedented levels of violence this country is facing because of their
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.880]  enforcement efforts yeah the drug war they admit the drug war is causing this
[41:26.880 --> 41:33.080]  holder declined to offer any time frame for the re-implementation of the assault
[41:33.080 --> 41:36.840]  weapons ban however now remember how a hundred and fifty plus years ago how the
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.720]  British brought down China within two decades of bringing opium into the
[41:40.720 --> 41:44.120]  country that was banned using the fact that it was illegal to buy off local
[41:44.120 --> 41:47.960]  police in the Custabulary they took over the port cities then with the US
[41:47.960 --> 41:51.200]  French the Dutch everybody else they went in and broke the country in ten
[41:51.200 --> 41:58.280]  parts because of the civil war caused over the opium money this is order out
[41:58.280 --> 42:04.760]  of KO order out of chaos they know exactly what they're doing the drug war
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.760]  will destroy America the bigger it gets more people on drugs the more people get
[42:10.760 --> 42:17.320]  killed more cops get killed the bigger the presence it's something as I said
[42:17.320 --> 42:20.640]  that the president talked about holder declined offer any time frame for the
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.000]  re-implementation of the assault weapons ban however it's something as I said the
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.520]  president talked about during a campaign he said there are obviously a number of
[42:27.520 --> 42:30.800]  things that are that have been taking up a substantial amount of his time like
[42:30.800 --> 42:33.720]  overthrowing the banking system and totally taken over the US yeah soon as
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.440]  that's done they're gonna move on your guns that have been taking up a
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.240]  substantial amount of his time and so I'm not sure exactly what the sequence
[42:41.240 --> 42:50.680]  will be you hear that in a brief interview with ABC News Wayne Lafayere
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.080]  president of the National Rifle Association said I think there's a lot
[42:54.080 --> 42:58.160]  of Democrats on Capitol Hill cringing it Eric Holder's comments right now but
[42:58.160 --> 43:00.840]  see they're rushing to get the machines in where you don't have a vote anymore
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.120]  so it won't matter daring his confirmation hearing a holder told the
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.400]  city's district committee about other gun control measures that Obama administration
[43:07.400 --> 43:11.560]  may consider and see they're gonna call it a reauthorization is open span but
[43:11.560 --> 43:15.680]  the Brady Center and violence policy center are saying they're gonna bundle
[43:15.680 --> 43:21.680]  basically a semi-auto bands of all handguns and rifles into it
[43:21.680 --> 43:25.960]  national registration psychological testing to own a gun no more owning a
[43:25.960 --> 43:31.440]  gun if you've ever had a misdemeanor or been to a shrink bands on old-fashioned
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.960]  ammo you have the new stamped ammo just total control this is a quote from
[43:37.960 --> 43:41.640]  Holder I think closing the gun show loophole that's banning you being able
[43:41.640 --> 43:45.560]  to sell a gun to your neighbor I think closing the gun show loophole the
[43:45.560 --> 43:48.360]  banning of cop killer bullets he always said like there's cop killer bullets
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.400]  like all bullets aren't cop killer that's to manipulate the police oh the
[43:52.400 --> 43:56.600]  holder wants to protect the law enforcement like they did it okay see
[43:56.600 --> 44:02.840]  they protect you they love you I think closing the gun show loophole the
[44:02.840 --> 44:06.480]  banning of cop killer bullets and I think that making the assault weapon
[44:06.480 --> 44:11.640]  banned permanent would be something that would be permitted under heller that's
[44:11.640 --> 44:16.680]  the Supreme Court decision see cuz that's the Supreme Court decision actually
[44:16.680 --> 44:20.280]  said they can restrict guns they said oh you have a second right for us to ban
[44:20.280 --> 44:25.040]  your guns holders said referring to the Supreme Court ruling in Washington D.C.
[44:25.040 --> 44:27.520]  versus heller which asserted the Second Amendment as an image was right to own
[44:27.520 --> 44:34.520]  a weapon the assault weapons ban signed into law by President Clinton 94 ban 19
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.640]  types of semi-automatic military-style guns ammunition clips with more than 10
[44:37.640 --> 44:41.000]  rounds a semi-automatic is a quintessential self-defense firearm
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.160]  owned by American citizens in this country La Pierre said I think it is
[44:45.160 --> 44:49.400]  clearly covered under the heller and is clearly I think protected by the
[44:49.400 --> 44:56.240]  Constitution the first comment on here on ABC news story says well that didn't
[44:56.240 --> 44:59.600]  take long did it the logic of holder statements really escaped me how will the
[44:59.600 --> 45:02.560]  ban of so-called assault weapons to civilians in the US have any impact on
[45:02.560 --> 45:06.160]  Mexican drug wars no impact at all no it'll make it better so we can live like
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.800]  to do there no impact at all none sure it's easy for Mexico to blame us for
[45:10.800 --> 45:15.720]  their failings up well it is the government the US did fund them with
[45:15.720 --> 45:24.760]  billions of dollars to start the war to shut down their drug dealing competition
[45:26.120 --> 45:31.240]  they have been doing it for years by definition no semi-automatic or any kind
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.120]  of assault weapon it is made up term that is bantered about with no thought
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.120]  behind it now there's total thought behind it's almost like oh hold your
[45:39.120 --> 45:43.600]  oh Clinton oh bush they're so stupid wanting this assault weapons ban they
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.200]  don't know what's going on they don't know what's happening I mean and they've
[45:47.200 --> 45:50.560]  got the American people trained where the average person if they're at your
[45:50.560 --> 45:55.720]  house and see a gun case they get scared like like like it's full of rattlesnakes
[45:55.720 --> 46:02.160]  and 14-foot cobras and in vipers and then and then all of this meanwhile your
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.760]  cars every year kill 35 40 times depending on the year what guns do
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.120]  swimming pools kill five times on average what guns do and most people being
[46:10.120 --> 46:13.080]  killed by guns or criminals in dating homes or drug dealers shooting each other
[46:13.080 --> 46:18.040]  up a citizen sees cops in paramilitary black masks with sub machine guns and
[46:18.040 --> 46:24.720]  they go oh I feel so safe oh yes oh oh but they see another slave with a gun
[46:24.720 --> 46:29.320]  they're like you're a slave you're not supposed to have a weapon and just like
[46:29.320 --> 46:35.000]  black house slaves in the United States 200 years ago if they saw a slave with
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.680]  even a knife or a mallet or a hickory stick or any type of weapon they would
[46:38.680 --> 46:43.120]  run in and say the slave the slaves got a weapon the slave the slaves got a
[46:43.120 --> 46:49.720]  weapon you are gelded you are domesticated you are cowardly you will
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.160]  be usurped you will be enslaved you will be robbed you'll be nailed to the wall
[46:54.160 --> 47:01.680]  until you actually grow up and be men and women out there every day I see
[47:01.680 --> 47:10.640]  articles where a woman calls 9-1-1 I saw one just this weekend where a woman
[47:10.640 --> 47:13.400]  called 9-1-1 it took the police 15 minutes to get there by the time they
[47:13.400 --> 47:18.000]  got there she was murdered I mean somebody starts busted in my house my
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.040]  wife just goes the instant access pistol safe that's in three rooms she has the
[47:23.040 --> 47:28.280]  revolver in seconds and she just relaxes calmly points at the center mass and
[47:28.280 --> 47:39.080]  opens fire until the firearms discharged that's it all these people buying in a
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.320]  hundred thousand two hundred thousand million dollar safe rooms and concrete
[47:43.320 --> 47:49.280]  with their own ventilation to hide out somebody starts coming to my house I
[47:49.280 --> 47:53.040]  just calmly like a robot go get the firearm so you gotta do it just relax
[47:53.040 --> 47:58.360]  take a deep breath and just open fire you know that woman with that chimpanzee
[47:58.360 --> 48:01.240]  that two hundred pounder you know a hundred pound shamp is as strong as a
[48:01.240 --> 48:04.480]  five hundred pound man in shape
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.760]  two hundred pounder that means it had the strength of a thousand pound man with
[48:10.760 --> 48:14.720]  two percent body fat ripped her nose off ripped her eyes out ripped her face off
[48:14.720 --> 48:20.880]  of course it was on a psychotropic always you know it's not normal you know the
[48:20.880 --> 48:27.320]  insert of those drug says causes psychotic breaks and delusions every
[48:27.320 --> 48:33.040]  mass shooter we've seen has been on it every case has been on it I've talked a
[48:33.040 --> 48:35.720]  lot of police when they pull up in a house in Houston or whatever in a naked
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.240]  woman's dancing on a roof slicing her breast off with butcher knives or a
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.760]  woman cuts her baby's arms off or drives their kids in the water they're always
[48:42.760 --> 48:48.400]  on it always because it's a hallucinogen and yeah you may have two or three years
[48:48.400 --> 48:52.280]  of good trips fucks putting you in a dream but you're gonna have that bad
[48:52.280 --> 48:59.640]  trip and then it floods the brain and triggers through the serotonin reuptake
[48:59.640 --> 49:06.960]  inhibitor system huge imbalances and then aggression hormones flood the
[49:06.960 --> 49:13.120]  brain do they try to stop people taking this no 20% of the public's on it now
[49:13.120 --> 49:16.200]  and under the new freedom initiative that Bush passed they say in there they
[49:16.200 --> 49:23.160]  want half of America's school children on it half and then they give the kids
[49:23.160 --> 49:26.960]  death education you know if you look at the number since federally funded death
[49:26.960 --> 49:30.160]  education began in schools first at Littleton Colorado at Columbine's
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.720]  first place it started they teach the kids about death how to commit suicide
[49:33.720 --> 49:37.880]  and then suicide explodes because they're teaching 10 11 12 13 year olds how to
[49:37.880 --> 49:41.400]  hang themselves how to shoot themselves then they put them on Prozac they tell
[49:41.400 --> 49:44.360]  them when you're depressed people don't commit suicide they teach them how to do
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.360]  it they kill themselves the social engineers know exactly what they're
[49:49.360 --> 49:57.360]  doing they know exactly what they're doing instead of taking your 12-year-old
[49:57.360 --> 50:01.160]  out and letting them fish and crawl around in creeks and build things in the
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.440]  shop or make models or spend time with them you put them in front of a TV five
[50:04.440 --> 50:09.240]  six hours a day you feed them coke a cola with all the caffeine and cocaine
[50:09.240 --> 50:13.080]  derivatives in it you let them eat all the crap they feel like crap they watch
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.600]  TV they go to school they're on hormones that make them go into puberty when
[50:16.600 --> 50:20.360]  they're eight years old they're all upset and freaked out you put them on speed
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.240]  you put them on Prozac then the school teaches them how to commit suicide then
[50:25.240 --> 50:30.200]  it just gets worse and worse and worse because you're in the world you're in a
[50:30.200 --> 50:37.760]  psychological warfare grid you're having eugenics carried out against you now
[50:37.760 --> 50:41.000]  they're gonna stage terror attacks they're gonna stage mass shootings you
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.200]  can bet your bottom dollar on that sooner rather than later we got to get the

[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:11.240]  the soviet op the chinese communist op the pole pod op
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:16.360]  the latin american ops they just haven't fully moved against us because we have
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:20.680]  the second amendment i don't want this

[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:27.880]  them off we can wake more people up but it's going to take
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:33.560]  maximum effort and facing the facts of how serious and grave
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:40.680]  and dire our situation is walker in china you're on the air
[1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:44.680]  hey alex first can you hear me okay yeah you're scott your computer phones
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:48.600]  breaking up a bit go ahead walker okay two points
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.800]  uh the first one is just a kind of a tangential point
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:54.760]  um my girlfriend here i've lived here about a year and a half
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:58.360]  and what and i've brought up the new world order and uh you know the
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:03.000]  new order narrative to her on several occasions and she told me that uh
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.280]  in her high school textbook now she was in high school back in
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.920]  oh one oh two uh during their political class whatever that means
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:14.680]  uh they read about the new world order and how it was a it was a good thing
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:17.800]  now she couldn't offer me any more details and i've asked her to retrieve
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.200]  the text let me just tell you let me just tell you
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.360]  there are hundreds of textbooks college high school middle school that we know
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:28.840]  of in the last six months we posted i think three different textbooks
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:31.880]  that are being used in middle school and high school with the names with the
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:35.800]  blow-up saying world government the bankers will rule you they know best
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:39.480]  second amendment is evil uh carbon taxes are wonderful
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:43.480]  and so just google textbook covers new world order or textbook covers kim
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:46.680]  trails there's a bunch of textbooks they teach high school students
[1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:51.720]  the government is spraying an aerosol in the air to form clouds to protect you
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.160]  from solar radiation because the ozone layer is dead
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:58.520]  and and you know so so see for the children they
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:01.960]  time magazine for kids that they give out free and most public schools
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:06.360]  has said in two issues that we know of your parents are backwards it literally
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:08.840]  says in foolish they don't know the future and how
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:12.440]  great it is to get a chip but you're trendy and awesome
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:17.800]  i mean sir it is like a science fiction nightmare dystopia
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:20.520]  so so yeah the kids they tell them we're spraying you
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:24.200]  yeah we're gonna tax you we're gonna take your guns now come line up the
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.160]  police dogs are coming you know it is it is just
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:31.880]  reeducation brainwashing camps and the parents are busy
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:35.880]  having no idea what's even going on but uh go ahead
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:39.320]  sure we have and and of course and i'm aware of those things going on in the
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:42.520]  u.s but it was strange to me because she grew up in
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:46.040]  the middle of nowhere in Sichuan here in china
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:50.200]  so it kind of uh... sir it's all unified china russia they're all in it
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:54.040]  together okay okay the second point is kind of a more
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:57.240]  a surface point but uh and this has to do with obama
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:01.960]  and um kind of the brzezinski influence um and this has to play and this is
[1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:05.640]  because i'm living in china so i'm aware of the uh the heightened
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:08.280]  kind of state of tension now that obama is in office
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:11.800]  and that you know the media plays up that it has to do with their human rights
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:16.040]  and the trade and all this other stuff uh i don't buy that i think it has
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:19.400]  i think obama is the africa candidate
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:24.120]  in that um uh you know it's been especially this is helped by the dubious
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:28.280]  veracity of its citizenship but china has made a lot of inroads into africa
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:31.560]  and they go sir it's in the ran corporation it's everywhere
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:36.760]  it's in the obama deception it's african like north com sent com south com
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:41.160]  they are space com they are saying they have already moved massive troops in
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:43.560]  africa they're building bases everywhere
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:46.360]  and yes they need they need him to be the front
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.920]  to allow the domination of africa okay great well that's all that's all i have
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:52.520]  to say alex thanks for all your good work
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.200]  no i'm glad you brought up very key points anything else
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:02.200]  uh no that's it thank you walker forest in california forest you're on the air
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:07.160]  oh yes sir alex jones um i want to say that
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:11.720]  all these people in organizations that serve
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:16.840]  the side of tyranny and human enslavement what they need to understand is
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:21.320]  that other than they get screwed to like you said before many many times
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:25.480]  it makes me think of of a gangster movie when we have a gang of criminals
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:29.000]  and then the boss guy takes out everybody else
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.840]  so but basically well what does the joker do in the latest batman the dark
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:35.640]  night he always kills his helpers after every job
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:42.840]  that's what they really do exactly and see see i'm telling why they did this
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:47.480]  in every nation cambodia china russia everywhere when they do this
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:50.120]  when the british would use a group to overthrow a country they would then kill
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:53.240]  them off going back 300 years the dutch would do it too
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:57.400]  they know that the group that helped bring them to power the foot soldiers
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:15:01.400]  know how to overthrow know how to take action and have avarice
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:04.840]  and so the first thing they do once they set up a total tyranny is they want the
[1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:09.080]  first group they kill just like with the nazis in the night of the long knives
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:15.160]  you know 40 000 people in a week you know erinst rom the head of the sa the
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:19.400]  first group they kill is the people that brought them to power 40 000 people in
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:22.840]  one week and they grabbed erinst rom that first night took him in a jail cell the
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.360]  ss walked in and he said why why are you doing this he said i love hitler i've
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:29.480]  known him ever since you know started the nazi party in the uh...
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:32.840]  in the 20s and and they said we're gonna kill you now and he said
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:36.760]  then kill me i worship hitler this is on record he goes high old hitler
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:39.640]  as they shot him in the chest with the luger go ahead
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:45.560]  exactly yeah and and about taxing cars and people
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:49.960]  for driving that is just the most unamerican thing i i can think of
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:54.040]  because i mean america is about freedom and being able to travel
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:58.280]  and you know if if there's hard times in one area people move to other areas
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:01.400]  where there's more opportunity and uh...
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:05.640]  you know having having checkpoints uh... in in states so people got to pay you
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.200]  uh... toll to get in i mean it's a yes all about
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:13.160]  keeping people locked in and uh... and the pentagon says that this is a
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:17.080]  military design grid
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:20.680]  yeah man we i just i all of us now we just gotta
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:24.280]  and they go oh we're just going door to door and blocking off the town and
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.040]  going and searching people's cupboards and and under their beds and stuff in
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:31.240]  their closets i mean what's the big deal so north com says they're going to
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:34.120]  use us against the american people in the army war college says it
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:39.240]  it still doesn't exist we're doing it but doesn't exist
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:42.600]  yeah i mean you all go to the heart of the matter
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:46.280]  because you all don't have any agenda you just
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:49.720]  you're you're about the highest common denominator we have we have an agenda
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:52.520]  it's liberty and freedom and and defeating tyranny
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:55.960]  right i mean and then see when when the
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.760]  uh... elite to talk about their their god you know what happened you know being
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:04.200]  the light or whatever what they're talking about is like shining the
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:07.160]  brights and people faces you know so they so they can't see where it go
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:11.080]  that's a play on words the that's why they worship black sun and i appreciate
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:16.440]  your call for us the the most secret symbol is the black sun
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:19.720]  it's a counter people ask well why do they call christ the morning star but
[1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:23.080]  then lose for the morning star well he's the counterfeit of that
[1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:27.480]  see see they expropriate art type all images that are good like the rising
[1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:31.560]  sun in the morning they expropriate that symbol and create a black sun
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:36.120]  why why is one of their greatest totems the owl
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:41.960]  you know lileth because it can see in the dark it is a bird of prey that can
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:44.600]  see in the dark we are in darkness they are illuminated
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:47.960]  we're like blind guinea pigs that have had our legs and arms chopped off being
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:51.720]  dropped into boa constrictors
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:55.480]  the points michael and mass you're on the air
[1:17:55.480 --> 1:17:59.720]  hey how's going alex i had two points i wanted to bring up this time
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:03.640]  um first off i listened to ron paul
[1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:08.120]  the other day grilled ben bernicke and while you know it's nice to see
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:12.040]  him give him a little lesson i gotta say i'm kind of getting
[1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:15.480]  a little sick and tired of hearing the same thing over and over again and
[1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:19.240]  you know let me just say i burned dvds i hand them out i confronted the mayor
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:22.680]  of boston you know what i mean i talked to police on a daily basis so i'm not
[1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:26.200]  just whining you know what i mean what i want to see
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:31.400]  from uh uh ron paul next time he has bernicke
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.560]  i mentioned this before why can't he just start embarrassing these people you
[1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:39.640]  know what i mean the the brain the main reason why the american people are
[1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:44.680]  still listening to the globalists is because the globalists still have this
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:49.640]  aura of yeah we have to call them out as criminals that need to be arrested
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:53.240]  like the state senator did yesterday and ron paul
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:56.440]  loving to death and i've told him this you know privately
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:00.280]  he is just too much of a gentleman too much of a nice guy they attacked him in
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:03.720]  the media i think if he'd have been more aggressive and more hardcore
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:07.960]  uh that that he would have had a better chance of winning
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:11.320]  and you know he does keep bringing up the point he he has laid out that it's
[1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:14.600]  all staged imploding so he's getting a lot of credibility right now
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:19.400]  uh but um you know it's not just a ron paul alone it's for all of us to carry
[1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:22.280]  the message i agree sir maybe uh maybe Dennis
[1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:25.800]  kucinich uh might be a better candidate i remember what he did to cash car
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:29.480]  well kucinich is good on a lot of issues but he is a socialist
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:32.920]  and he is for second movement restrictions certainly can i just mention

[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:23.160]  funding because when i when i busted the police's chops about uh
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:26.600]  something here he mentioned oh we've been doing this for years we got federal
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:30.280]  funding back you know when the when the democratic national convention was
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:32.520]  there so i just thought that was funny but anyways
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:36.680]  yesterday i'm leaving work and i pulled into uh i walk into the silver line
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:39.960]  station at the world trade center here in boston and
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:43.800]  they had a table set up about five or ten police officers told them
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:47.160]  and they had this little computerized device on top of it so so i walk up to
[1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.920]  him you know and i do this all the time i'm a slave talk to
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:55.400]  in america oh yeah alex you would have loved the faces these guys are giving me
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:00.280]  it was incredible talking to them oh yeah you know they don't talk to slaves oh yeah i'm

[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:18.440]  and i had to write thousands of different things that make it false alerts so that's
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:23.480]  their little excuse to search everybody going on the train yeah and so i just kind of like
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:26.600]  laughed and said you know whatever you guys are ridiculous and
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:30.360]  walked away but then when i got to soul station i started talking to somebody
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:34.040]  the police officers and i said look do you guys ever get concerned
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:37.160]  that this is all just you know illusion they're just trying to keep everybody
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:40.360]  scared so that you know they just put you out there you know where there's
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:45.640]  certainly no threat and he just kind of you know smiled and was like well you
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:48.920]  know that's your opinion i'm not here to talk about you know people's political
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:54.680]  opinion is just like these police officers are so or welly it like it pinned down
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:58.520]  in that orwellian mindset where like you know it's not even double think it's
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:02.040]  just don't think in the first place now that's called
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:08.360]  that's called crime stop yeah in 1984 you don't even have a thought that could
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:12.440]  question the state because that's al-qaeda ish that's goldstein ish that's the
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:15.000]  secret brotherhood ish thank you for the call
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:20.200]  brent in washington welcome another new order command base go ahead
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:26.920]  now it's how you doing today pretty good hey listen uh i've got the why i say i
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.320]  got the answer the scriptures had the answer to a lot of this new world order
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:35.560]  problem and and what have you that you the problem is if we push people towards
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:38.760]  the churches most of them are nothing but fema fronts now
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:43.880]  publicly the brainwash so but yes the scriptures are the answer the problem
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:47.480]  is the scriptures are twisted and aren't taught in the devil church
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.640]  that's right that's right and it's it that the base foundation of that
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:55.880]  devil's church is right there in revelations chapter 17 and 18 the whore
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:01.080]  these churches the catholic church and all the other harwick daughters that it
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:04.760]  talks about is the whole organized religious system
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:08.760]  basically if you got any church operating under a 501c3
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:12.920]  that you're part of the harwick church system well i know that it
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:16.520]  it violates the first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:20.360]  establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof but 50
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:23.720]  years ago now about 58 years ago they tricked the churches oh it's just a
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:27.960]  form you sign and then they become a charity and now they're under federal
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:31.800]  regulatory control and now they're being publicly co-opted
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:36.360]  and yes every major domination serves the new world order now
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:39.880]  yeah and that's i came out of that but anyway back
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:43.400]  back to the source of the or the answer to the problem
[1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:46.520]  i believe the scriptures are very clear that the
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:51.240]  the ultimate answer to our problem today of this invasion of the new world
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:55.080]  order and the global masters is the second coming
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:58.680]  to christ that's our and you know we talk about ron paul
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:03.560]  we talk about well bill cooper i mean the list goes right on down
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:09.480]  line yeah let me just say this to you
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:12.760]  people in nazi germany thought hitler was the antichrist it was into the world
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:16.280]  they told founding fathers stand down roman's 13 god's will
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:19.400]  and i see the church is going praise the lord they're chipping people it means
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:22.440]  the end is here and then there's this cop out about a
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.880]  pre-trip rapture it's all a big distraction and diversion
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:29.640]  and people cop out on that and say oh jesus is coming back
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:33.480]  you know he's going to fix it well why didn't the why didn't the prophets get
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:36.520]  you know stand down and you know and and do it ceasar said why were they
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:39.720]  killed why were they in prison why were they tortured why was why did they
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:44.280]  see christ you're supposed to fight evil and if you're not
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:48.120]  then your tree is not bearing any fruit at all and you know
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:51.480]  faith without works is dead so that when the bottom line here is
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:55.240]  i see the problem emanating out of the christian churches i see them
[1:28:55.240 --> 1:28:59.000]  as a bunch of smiley face painted trollops and minions
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.360]  and they people go to church to find other people to hook up with to have sex
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:06.680]  they go to church to have fun and make business deals
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:09.240]  they go to church to worship the government and most of their preachers
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:13.160]  are on the payroll and the new world or churches are saying jesus is coming
[1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:18.600]  praise the lord nothing has to happen just put your faith in jesus and we
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:21.800]  don't have to do anything we're about to be out of here and they're not going to
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:26.760]  be out of here what do you say to that i agree i used to believe when i was in
[1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:31.000]  the harrow church system i believe that the uh look you know that they taught us
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.880]  for years that we were going to have a
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:36.840]  pre-tribulation rapture and we didn't have to worry about anything
[1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:40.440]  i i do not agree with that matthew 24 verse
[1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:45.240]  29 pretty much nips that in the bud tell us that verse when we come back and

[1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:57.320]  and then he saw a government drug dealing in elepongo the cocaine being loaded
[1:33:57.320 --> 1:34:00.120]  on the c-130s he blew the whistle he's testified

[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:08.200]  and he's gotten death threats and and he said a few years ago the information
[1:34:08.200 --> 1:34:11.400]  he was bringing out now that he'd been threatened for exposing the fact that
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:15.000]  the batf through color of law without warrants
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:19.400]  terrorizes the gun show owners all over texas and it's all over the country

[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.960]  you know in the back room or up in the ceiling watching everyone and trying to
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:32.600]  set folks up for no reason in private transfers of firearms
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:35.240]  and they threatened even said you know we're going to get you for this
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:39.560]  and they did set him up once that was beaten court they some of again i want
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:43.560]  to talk about this case because it's coming to a head here's the
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:48.280]  headline out of the news out of the narco news
[1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:54.280]  prosecutor claims iran connor whistleblower is a danger to society
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:58.280]  but before we get into that celly i've been interviewing you
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:02.760]  for close to a decade now remember whole time flies
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:06.120]  four years ago having you on air and then again three years ago then again in
[1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:09.800]  two years ago and then and i got separate intel on this everything he said
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:12.360]  checked out and then you know somebody over the years and
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:17.000]  talked to other people that have worked for the cia
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.200]  now like mr reed who's in my police state to the takeover who was at the other
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:24.360]  end of elopango in mina with oliver north and bill clinton with the cocaine
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:27.320]  coming in and he was the whistle only went after him
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:31.960]  and he's on record he wrote clinton bush and the cia
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:36.520]  but uh everything he said is checked out i mean i remember
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:39.480]  having celly on
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:44.520]  five and a half years ago when we'd only been on a wreck six months and he said
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:47.880]  they're using death squads and tens of thousands of people out of
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.640]  latin america to run the death camps in iraq and he said they're
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:54.040]  torturing them all this and then that all came out and then it came out
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:56.040]  mainstream news this was not in the news at the time
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:36:00.600]  they were using death squads down there and so that's why i pay attention to
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:05.320]  what celly says the school teacher now
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:10.200]  and uh his job is of course a lot of trouble now they try to set him up on
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:15.640]  a firearms selling deal selling somebody who set him up
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:20.440]  just legally private transfer but they selectively say that's illegal
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:24.840]  and celly going back four years ago said the maxico is going to collapse by
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:28.120]  design they're going to put in a right winger after
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:32.200]  vasante fox leaves and i mean this is before we'd heard a
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:35.560]  calderon he i mean he it's all on video i even had
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:38.760]  even studio this is all out on the web this is there i need somebody to go
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:41.720]  edit this new interview with that and it'll show that we predicted all the
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:44.920]  time to go pull it upward do it myself we're too busy here but in
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:48.200]  listeners you can because i mean proof is in the pudding of what we say
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:50.760]  coming true because we have all these great sources that i've vetted over the
[1:36:50.760 --> 1:36:55.240]  years and i appreciate celly being patient to
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:59.240]  come on i just want to lay out how important his sacrifice is
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:01.800]  a lot of folks have died but imprisoned been set up to bring you this
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:05.640]  information now
[1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:10.040]  celica stillo said that they were training wassettis
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:13.640]  right out of the mexican military the cia to go after the four other drug
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:18.280]  cartels that only have about 30 percent or less 35 or less
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:21.880]  of and i've seen other studies on this of the drugs that aren't being laundered
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:26.040]  by the cia through the banks so these are uncertified drug dealers just like
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:29.240]  the park had to be killed and attacked richard grasso head of the new york
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:32.440]  stock exchange the time publicly went to columbia met with the head of the
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:34.200]  park and said invest with us we won't invade
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:39.400]  they said no stay invaded that's a double set of rules openly saying
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:42.920]  invest your money with us and so there's been a covert war down
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:45.320]  there for close to a decade and he said they were going to do it in
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:49.160]  mexico designing the fall of mexico for
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:53.000]  basically to then bring us into north american union then the spp documents
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.680]  came out and that's exactly what they were planning they said through crises
[1:37:56.680 --> 1:38:00.760]  we will get our north american union and now the border is under martial law without
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:04.200]  a state senator on confirming that the national guard is there
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:09.640]  the deaths are now in the thousands every month it is just insane
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:13.080]  and celica stillo was right about all that and now they're trying to sit into
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:16.200]  prison no criminal record up until the time they
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:19.960]  set him up vietnam vet sniper police officer dea
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:24.120]  highly decorated celica stillo i want to get into your plight
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:29.640]  but first just recap what is happening with mexico right now any new added data
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:35.240]  you're down there on the border and um where this whole agenda is going with
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:39.400]  obama and the rest of it okay basically oh first of all thanks for
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:44.280]  having me once again uh alex and i certainly appreciate what west is doing
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:47.800]  for me here um the thing about it in mexico i
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:51.400]  said it several years ago that the united states is going to try to take over
[1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:54.760]  mexico whether they'll use drug trafficking or
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:58.840]  corruption or whatever you want to call it and that's what they're moving into
[1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:01.720]  now you know you got to remember mexico's got some of the best mineral
[1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:05.640]  rights and gas you know petroleum you name it they
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.280]  have it uh in mexico so it's one of the less resources of
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:15.000]  of the fuel economy that we're having today but the on the drug cartels the
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.880]  thing about it that most if not the major drug cartels are working
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:24.760]  for the mexican military and that's where everybody's so confused about
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.440]  fighting the cartels and so forth but the the bottom line
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:35.880]  it is the cartels they are uh are supporting uh weapons going into mexico
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:40.440]  as as a reason uh you got to remember also that mexico for the first time has
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:45.080]  admitted that they have a paramilitary group now and this is where some of
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.000]  these weapons are coming in yes they are fighting some members of the drug
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:53.480]  cartels which are freelancing and not following the rules so that's where you
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:58.040]  have to make the problems but in mexico what they're doing the military is going
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:03.880]  in and taking all this property land home from everybody else
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:07.720]  offering them a a very small percent of what the value is and then
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:11.560]  whatever money they get they bring into the us to london
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:15.080]  and and that's exactly what's going on in mexico if you see you don't see any
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:19.880]  major drug cartels bosses being killed you do have a couple of
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:23.000]  guys that uh that are being exodited but they're they're
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  no big deals i mean it's it's it's just outrageous what the
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.200]  mexican government is doing all right let me stop you right there
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:32.680]  countless high-level officials the head of drug
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:35.400]  interdiction all of them caught with billions of dollars literally one guy
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:38.520]  at his house had was something like six hundred million dollars
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:42.280]  us dollars in his basement and the whole thing was just filled with cash and you
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:46.280]  know a giant mansion uh i was down in mexico a few months ago
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:50.520]  in uh yucatan and uh you know went down there
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:54.840]  to do some snorkeling take a few days off with the family and i said last time i
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:57.640]  was here in costa maya there were always fishing boats and i've been down there
[1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:01.480]  twice before they said yeah all fishing has been banned and they're taking all
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:04.600]  the local people's property that have paid for it and even had taxes
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:08.680]  and the town was basically empty now and then i talked to other towns people and
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:12.120]  they said yes so i googled it and i knew that under the un
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:16.280]  biosphere moves in the 80s they pushed most the indigenous in chiapas and other
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:19.720]  areas off of their cornfields they've been there for thousands of years but
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:23.080]  didn't have deeds up to mexico city and then to the uh
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:25.880]  maquilador is up on the border the staging ground
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.320]  but yes the mexican trips are now everywhere you go there's mexican
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:33.000]  trips they're shoving people around they're done they're just literally
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:37.640]  robbing and squeezing wanting a revolution and there's been rebellions
[1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:40.520]  as you know silly the public doesn't know us reporters have been machine gun in
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:43.880]  front of everyone but that's only makes it in foreign news
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.800]  uh i mean you said in the past they plan to cause a revolution there
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:51.000]  to then have an even bigger clamp down can you explain that
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:54.920]  well yes basically what they're doing is once again they're forcing people out
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:41:58.760]  of their lands uh people that live there make their lives for many many many
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:01.560]  years and basically they realize that the real
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.560]  estate is huge uh sometimes bigger than the drug
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:10.360]  uh trafficking that's occurring and and doing it legally taking those lands
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:13.240]  away uh the problem that the mexican military is
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:17.720]  having right now is trying to longer the money to the u.s banks
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:21.640]  but say for example a couple of months ago three hundred million dollars just
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:25.720]  came in into one account here in in south texas
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:28.920]  uh belonging to the military where they are actually
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:32.200]  laundering the money to different bank accounts and
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:36.040]  there is a huge amount of money coming coming out of out of mexico
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:41.880]  and into the u.s and uh there certainly are trying to put a dog a
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:46.280]  dog and a pony showing up on the face of this thing that
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:50.040]  that it's out of control completely in the u.s i think just governor prairie
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.640]  just said yesterday there they're bringing in thousands of uh national
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:58.440]  guards into the borders now mind you what happens is when they come in here
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:03.640]  there are going to be scrimmages because it is the mexican military that's
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:08.120]  involving the drug trade so there will be firefights along the river
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:11.240]  oh i mean we've talked to folks who fly their planes and shoot video along the
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:14.040]  border the mexican flatback trucks come up
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:17.480]  load the drugs on other trucks drive it across i mean our criminal government
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:21.320]  knows that uh they've now had the new attorney general
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:24.840]  eric holder announced that they want to basically ban most our guns in the u.s in
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:28.280]  the name of not having them shipped to mexico but we know where the guns are
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:31.640]  really really coming from down to mexico the military on record
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:35.960]  has bought four times the arms they need for personnel and they just sell them
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:40.600]  directly to the drug cartels the big ones that are cracking down on the baby
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:45.160]  cartels how's the war a comment on that and then how's the war
[1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:49.880]  going against the mini cartels well this is what's going on there's
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:54.360]  playing a room for everybody to make money that that is what the drug
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:58.760]  trade has spent for many many many years but you gotta remember when you see
[1:43:58.760 --> 1:44:02.040]  those big docking pony shows on the newspapers
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:06.200]  of hundreds of uh ar-15s and handguns and so forth
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:09.800]  you gotta remember that on the background you see the m
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:16.440]  204 grenade launchers uh the the ammunition the 204 ammo the 40 millimeter
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:20.280]  mic mic what they call them uh they're used for grenade launchers
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:26.280]  those are all u.s military issue cases of grenades i mean
[1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:30.520]  thousands of cases of grenades those come from a u.s military doesn't come
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:35.080]  from a gun store in south texas it comes straight from the military our
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:38.360]  u.s military and i found that to have happened
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:42.200]  before doing your rank contra investigation when they were the u.s
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:44.920]  government was supporting the conscience i personally
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:49.720]  seized the warehouse full of u.s munitions u.s grenades
[1:44:49.720 --> 1:44:55.480]  u.s m16 and when i brought u.s guns to investigate to trace the ammo
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:44:59.240]  and the weapons uh the defense department of defense
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:03.960]  put a stop to the investigation and this is key you said on record here on this
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:06.840]  show four years ago and then three years ago
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:11.480]  that there was a massive military buildup with the Pentagon
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:15.640]  training in south texas and other areas and giving him grenades
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:19.000]  and military weapons now those are showing up that was in abc news but
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:23.160]  they say the grenades are from gun chops again i mean the article implies
[1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.600]  that and says we've got to ban your guns in america because there's grenades
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:29.800]  i mean then that's how dumb the public is they talk to us like children
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:32.760]  explain to me the players here and i want to get into your plight selly
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:36.760]  uh because you know uh by way i need to give you my my office number because
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:40.680]  uh uh west uh you know called me up here and said can you have
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:44.920]  selling on when you need help i need to give you my producers number
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:48.280]  so that you don't have to go running around town calling people you've known
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:52.520]  uh to get him to call here you know it's but i mean we'll talk about that later
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:56.840]  the point is or i should be my cell phone number but but the the issue here is
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:45:59.000]  selling because i didn't know you were going to court this soon
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:02.040]  uh and maybe i'll hold you a little bit over and maybe move key back because
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:05.480]  this is so important or maybe have you on after he you know i would love to go
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:09.800]  back uh elix and just having a sitting uh with you at
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:13.720]  studio and i'm willing to do that anytime you have to go up there i'll
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:17.160]  drive up there and and do that because i think it's very important
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:21.880]  with the issues in mexico that's happening our bands in our weapons
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:27.800]  and i need to explain to the public about the the myth of the ar-15 is going
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:31.480]  into mexico and there's something really big that the american people need to
[1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:35.080]  know about those weapons which is really against the government
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:38.920]  and and they need to be educated on that stay there but but but but
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:42.760]  my last question on the subject you said they were planning to foment an
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:47.000]  implosion and arming paramilitary forces through the pentagon
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.640]  many school of america trained people down there as well
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:53.400]  so explain to me the battle configuration we know we have the big drug
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:56.600]  cartels backed by chase manhattan city bank and others
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:46:59.640]  they're down there wanting to consolidate the drug war
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:04.120]  uh wanting to knock their competition out so they can even jack up prices higher
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:08.440]  um a how is that war going is it four or five
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:14.440]  mini cartels uh they're fighting and you know so and they can bust the myth that
[1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:18.680]  oh they're this is happening as calderon is fighting the drug dealers
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:22.360]  no he's trying to consolidate the drug trade so specifically what's the master
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:27.320]  plan the master plan is real simple uh if you go to monorail
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:31.720]  novellion that's like the headquarters for all the drug
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:38.680]  trafficking um gun smuggling uh stolen vehicles operations and
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:42.840]  they are actually 200 what they're called officinas
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:46.440]  offices and they're run by different crime syndicates
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:53.080]  including the military and out of those 200 you have maybe 10 major
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:57.640]  uh criminal syndicates that run the whole operation and say you're coming to
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:03.400]  new uh uh novellorado i mean um novellion uh monorail area
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:08.120]  with a shipment of cocaine coming from central america uh there are codes
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:13.560]  there are barcodes you have to tag as the checkpoints and that will verify if
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:17.640]  you're a legitimate uh drug traffic or you're not and if you're not
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:21.240]  they kill you they take the drugs same thing with the money
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:25.080]  the money is coming from the us into mexico
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:29.320]  the same thing it is a very huge operation but it's mostly run
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:34.760]  by the mexican military and remember that they have now black water well
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  which is now known as these uh uh into mexico uh being part of the
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:44.920]  money laundering operations that we have back in the 80s uh with the bcc
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:49.000]  i banks uh it went as far as that now the drug
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.560]  cartels of mexican government the mexican military has now purchased
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:59.080]  several banks in spain which just implemented one of those banks
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:05.000]  into south texas so this is huge this is nothing that the uh the mini cartels
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.600]  are right no no this is drug trafficking at large
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:12.520]  by the by the mexican government and supported by the u.s
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:17.480]  um yes and it's so industrialized it's barcodes it shipments 400 million
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:20.840]  dollars conservatively a year yeah i mean so it's just totally
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:24.440]  industrialized and i've even talked to people on the in the military in the
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:28.680]  u.s with those surveillance blimps and they say they're told the guy behind
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:33.240]  him an intelligence officer stop that don't stop that stop that don't stop
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.160]  that and they'll have planes coming in that are flashing a code i mean this
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:44.920]  this is industrial level this is massive absolutely absolutely and it's a
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:48.360]  and you know it's not going to stop either so what is the war the war is
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:52.280]  them knocking out the baby cartels exactly the baby cartels because there
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:55.560]  are plenty of room for everybody to get rich down in Mexico
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:00.280]  and in the u.s uh like i said we have more banks in south texas than we do
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:04.200]  circle case with seven eleven uh so needless to say
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:09.080]  um the banking system is thriving on on the drug trade
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:13.400]  and i've always said alex if we were to stop drug trafficking today
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:18.600]  our banking system could collapse absolutely so we are we come back i want

[1:50:36.840 --> 1:50:40.040]  all of this well we know i told people months ago they're
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:43.240]  going to use the implosion in mexico for gun control here and they're doing it and
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:47.480]  i mean on the news it's fully auto you wanted to comment on that too
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:52.680]  m16s with the grenade launchers and grenades this is not from the gun shop
[1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:55.800]  but everything has to be blamed on our precious second amendment

[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:26.600]  specifically exposing other setting people up at gun shows you told newspapers
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:31.080]  that you testified to that went into court cases exposed it
[1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:36.280]  and they threatened you they did set you up tell folks what's happening to you
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:41.160]  okay the latest thing Alex is the fact that I had a court hearing last week
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:44.760]  and basically my new attorney filed a motion
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:51.800]  for me to stay out on appeal and of course the the government responded
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:56.680]  to the motion and they cited that I was a danger to society
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:00.520]  and basically what they did was the the a usa in the case
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:05.160]  the got up there and made the outrageous allegations once again
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:08.520]  which he has been doing for the past several months
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:11.880]  and basically the judge wouldn't have any part of it
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:17.800]  and he cited my record and that I was not a danger to society
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:22.600]  although he did deny the motion for me to stay out on appeal
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:27.400]  my attorney was was very well read into the fact that she asked for an extension
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:30.440]  for myself surrender so the judge went ahead and did that
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:34.040]  and gave me to maybe june or july to self-surrender again
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:36.920]  but at that time period there's going to be a motion
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:40.840]  attached to it to where I should try to remain
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:46.280]  on an appeal and but basically what I'm trying to do now Alex I need financial
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:50.280]  support from the public because I need to hire an attorney
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:54.520]  that's going to file civil rights violations against the government
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:59.240]  and I have the proof and the evidence to for that and I need to file that
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:02.920]  and I I need to do that in the next couple of months and I need to get
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:07.160]  hired an attorney to do that for me because the violations under under the
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.240]  fourth amendment and under the 16th amendment
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:14.760]  and they did violate they made a false arrest I mean knowing the fact that it
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:18.120]  that it wasn't warranted and they filed a criminal
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:22.120]  complaint with false information so that's a violation of my constitutional
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:25.400]  folks that don't know it was a gun case of a private
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:30.200]  transfer of a firearm a firearms exactly you know
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:33.800]  another guy bought the guns and he sold them to me
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:38.840]  and they knew that there is a constitutional law case called Pope
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:42.600]  versus US that says he was not a prohibited person and I
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:46.200]  wasn't a prohibited person so there was no arrest there but yet
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:48.920]  they manufactured an evidence by saying that I had
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:53.560]  fired with a convicted felon and they named the guys individual and guess what
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:57.640]  that guy still sells guns at the gun show with a license Alex
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.480]  with a license so they they manufactured that evidence
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:05.480]  and and it was false it was burgery well for folks that don't know the feds
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:11.480]  admit they have thousands per state of felon
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:14.840]  informants who have never even seen people before
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:17.800]  and they'll just come in and say they saw you commit a murder anything
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:21.800]  I mean this is how the federal courts work yeah and and that's what it is but
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:24.520]  what it is this is bought me some more time to

[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:23.240]  their house a resolution very strong resolution
[2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:26.040]  declaring state independence against gun confiscation
[2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:30.440]  martial law we had uh state senator brogdon
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:33.480]  on yesterday who has a mirror of it in the senate
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:38.040]  have a very good chance of passing it in the senate now a majority of states
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:42.760]  have introduced or are passing uh this uh type of legislation
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:46.200]  have a headline up on info wars dot com covering
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:50.120]  that right now so representative charles key thank you uh for what you're doing

[2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:58.200]  be with you again thank you you better tell us what's going on
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:09:02.360]  well we're just uh i'm just getting flooded from by emails and people all
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:04.840]  over the country and in our state and even
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:09.560]  few legislators there's the list is growing i think it's about 30 or so now
[2:09:09.560 --> 2:09:12.920]  it looks like it's just going to keep growing of states that have filed a
[2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:16.040]  tenth amendment resolution or something like it
[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:19.080]  and i'm really encouraged i think things are moving in a good direction
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:22.920]  right now in our country at the state level
[2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:27.800]  well that said i'm sure you know that the attorney generals announced they are
[2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:31.240]  going to in introduce soon an expanded assault weapons
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:34.520]  band and they've got gun registration gun bands in
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:38.360]  their psychological federal testing i mean they're moving quick so it's it's
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:41.400]  a good thing the states are moving to block it
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:45.800]  yes and you know i'm getting tired of this i think what the people need to do
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:50.200]  and i think state legislators need to do we need to face up to the fact
[2:09:50.200 --> 2:09:53.960]  that we have people in office at the federal and state level
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:58.840]  that are violating the supreme law of the land and other laws for that matter
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:01.960]  and we need to call them what they are their law breakers
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:06.280]  they are the ones that are breaking the law no one wants to really say that i
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:09.720]  don't find any great pleasure in saying that in
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:13.400]  you know addressing this problem in this way but i think it's time that we do
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:17.480]  that because we can't continue to give ground
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:21.800]  away to those that will violate the supreme law of the land
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:26.200]  and put up laws that are in violation of it and really are no laws at all
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:29.640]  you can't have a supreme law of the land that says
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:34.280]  and lays out what every level of government and individuals within the
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:38.040]  government can and cannot do and then allow those individuals to then
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:40.600]  violate that and just make it up as they go along
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:44.200]  well we know what they're doing we know in the jesse trying to do
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:49.720]  a murder case we have via the lawsuit this is made national news
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:52.760]  his internal memos that the attorney general his deputy attorney general
[2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:56.520]  under clinton covering up and saying this is a national security matter of
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:00.360]  this okc thing we've got to pull out all the stops this is like a d-day
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:04.200]  operation this is national security highest level
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:09.080]  we got to cover this up now this is a really nasty character
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:13.000]  well you know we can fix these problems in this country there's so many examples
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:16.520]  in oakland city bombing cases are very good one to thank god for jesse
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:20.520]  try to do people like him that won't let go and they keep fighting this
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:24.120]  thing and dig more and more evidence out but there's more than enough evidence
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:28.040]  for the people to see that their government is out of control
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:31.480]  you know the difficulty is knowing that uh there's a lot of good people in
[2:11:31.480 --> 2:11:34.680]  government there are and probably a lot more than there are good there's no
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:38.840]  question about that but you keep putting these pieces in place
[2:11:38.840 --> 2:11:42.920]  of laws and regulations and in the in the bad players
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:46.600]  in the government and you allow an opportunity for
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:50.520]  people to take advantage of it you know i heard a guy on a radio show that was a
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:53.720]  call in just a few days ago and he was talking about
[2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:57.000]  his father-in-law who was born in 1900 died in
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.200]  1999 he was 99 years old german lived in germany all his life
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:06.280]  lived through both world wars and this son-in-law was asking him
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:10.760]  as the son-in-law was doing a doctorate and putting a paper together he
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:14.200]  interviewed him for that paper that he was preparing and he asked him what it
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:18.600]  was like between the two world wars world war one and world war two and
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:22.040]  among some of the things he said he said that the father
[2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:26.520]  he was an attorney by the way he said you know people knew it was coming
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:29.720]  but what happened is once they got all these little they took all these little
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:32.280]  incremental steps and got these laws in place
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:35.880]  it made it very very difficult almost impossible to stop it
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:39.240]  because people allowed it to happen step by step
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:43.240]  and it's easy for us to think in a defeatist way and sometimes we as
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:46.680]  christians will even think well it says in the bible that in the
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:50.360]  end times this that or the other you know whatever scenario whatever
[2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:53.960]  interpretation and then think in terms of well it's
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:58.200]  going to happen there's nothing we can do to stop it or it's too hard to stop
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:03.240]  that's just defeatist thinking we we must overcome that kind of thinking
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:07.000]  and stand up to these things that are going on in our society
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:11.960]  because um you know we can stop this from happening we can do it peacefully
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:15.800]  without any kind of violent action needing or having to be taken later on
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:18.920]  down the road and i agree the united states really is the only place ever
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:22.680]  that had you know the closest you can get to true freedom and liberty
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:25.480]  and had never been done before and we did it here and look how
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:28.600]  it's just more dirt this country doesn't have that much resources compared to
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:31.720]  mexico or other places that you know are enslaved
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:35.640]  it was because that spirit of liberty and that trailblazing idea and that idea
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:39.560]  that uh of entrepreneurial spirit and so many other
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:43.720]  things that that adventurer spirit that this
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:46.200]  country became so wealthy so all the evil
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:49.560]  moved here to take over that engine and now they've done that they're trying to
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:53.480]  secure the robbery of the hijacking they've committed
[2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:56.680]  and they're so openly criminal i mean it's turning out that most of obama's
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:14:01.160]  administration just doesn't even pay taxes and and uh that is his chief of
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:04.040]  staff and the head of the treasury and they just don't care
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:09.240]  and they're openly setting up youth brigades and spy forces and fema camps
[2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:12.440]  i mean but thank god the states are moving to
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:15.800]  block it and and if the people get excited about this and take action
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:20.840]  there's nothing that can really stop us well and here's what i think is another
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:24.760]  uh point of information that should be encouraging to people
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:28.360]  and if they will take advantage of it it can pay a lot of dividends
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:31.720]  the fact that there's a lot of good old state legislators out there
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:35.320]  some of them are more knowledgeable than what we we think or know and some of
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:37.960]  them are not but they're pretty good people
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:43.080]  and if we if people will go and and educate them will communicate with them
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:46.360]  or just give them the support in a lot of cases give them the support let them
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:50.200]  know you're there and that you want them to take these actions like
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:53.240]  oppose real id act and other things like that
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:58.040]  uh support constitutional legislation and a return to the constitution
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:01.000]  they will stand up and do that if people will just
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  back them up exactly what happened is good people stood down and said oh
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.280]  america's fine we won world war two we're the good guys and the evil just took
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:10.920]  over if we just stop sucking our thumbs and stop
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:14.600]  saying it's too big a problem and having this defeatist attitude
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:18.520]  we can't take things back but if we don't folks some of the worst
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:21.800]  criminals in history are now in control of our society foreign banks are
[2:15:21.800 --> 2:15:24.520]  openly looting us and now we've got you here today
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:28.120]  you got the resolution passed in the house tell us how that fight went
[2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:31.640]  and then now it's going to the senate and the state senator your colleague
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:35.000]  told me yesterday on air that it looks like it's got a good chance of passing
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:38.280]  so so tell us how that process of passing state sovereignty
[2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:41.880]  a declaration what's in it and then now where it's going how we carry the you
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:44.200]  know we've got the ball down to the one yard line
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:49.000]  and uh you know we got one down here how do we get across it
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:52.840]  well here in oklahoma it's in good hands over the senate with senator brogdon
[2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:56.120]  he's going to punch it on over the goal line over there that it's done
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:15:59.000]  and i think that's going to happen in the next couple of weeks
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:02.760]  uh it will probably the first state to pass it out of both bodies
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:07.240]  um so it's moving down the road real well we captured the republicans captured
[2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:10.360]  the senate and so that puts us in a much better position
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:14.360]  to be able to pass legislation like this people are becoming more
[2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:17.880]  aware and informed but i'm talking again about legislators
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:21.160]  um the people here in oklahoma there's some organizations that have come
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:24.760]  together and just individuals that have come out to
[2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:28.840]  uh lobby and inform their legislators about their interest in the tenth
[2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:32.360]  amendment resolution and other legislation that they're either
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:36.120]  for against because it's uh you know it's it's protecting their
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:40.600]  rights or it's uh opposing laws that are bad for their constitutional rights
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:44.760]  and those groups those groups have become pretty powerful here in oklahoma
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:49.080]  i know other states can do the same thing it's right people just organized
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:52.920]  and uh we'd be we'd be willing to help them right here in oklahoma these groups
[2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:57.800]  myself there's a lot of folks that are doing a great job in oklahoma
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:17:01.400]  and if you don't have something going in your state you can easily get
[2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:04.120]  something going and get a lot of people to think alike
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:07.720]  you know together and start lobbying your legislature it'll pay off
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:14.440]  resistance is victory resistance is victory and that's what's so scary
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:17.160]  about this is that people don't realize the power
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:19.880]  they have and when i interview representatives from all over the
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:23.560]  country i mean all over the nation the east the
[2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:27.800]  south the west the central states i mean these are democrats and
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:30.360]  republicans and they know about the fema camps and they know the bill
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:34.760]  numbers they know about the pd-51 they know about the gun confiscation they
[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:37.880]  know about the new world order they know the foreign banks are taking over
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:41.080]  they know and i and they tell me that the word is
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:46.200]  spreading fast and folks that's the countries of leadership
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:49.960]  that now fully know we have a criminal federal government
[2:17:49.960 --> 2:17:53.560]  and if we just put it wind in their sails
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:56.920]  on the good ship of liberty we are unstoppable i'm telling you
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:18:00.280]  the education levels high enough now that if they pull a false flag
[2:18:00.280 --> 2:18:04.120]  or whatever to try to attack the states or you know poses our savers to bring
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:06.600]  in martial law i don't think it's going to work
[2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:09.960]  and but the but the foreign banks are going for broke they've engaged in so
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:13.400]  many crimes now they've got to bring in a total police state
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:18.600]  to secure their bill their ill-gotten gain can you speak to that sir
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:23.000]  well i think uh... again i think if people will
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:26.680]  work at the state level of what their state legislators their house members
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:29.560]  and senate members that's going to pay big dividends
[2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:33.560]  i just came out of a meeting with our assistant floor leaders
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:37.480]  uh which i'm one of here in the house and we have a weekly meeting we review
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:41.320]  legislation things that are going on to talk about various topics
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:45.400]  and we had some good discussions about some of these kinds of issues including
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:51.400]  the real idea act and biometric and uh you know privacy issues and things like
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:55.400]  that and again legislators are just like
[2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:58.280]  people that you work with every day and deal with every day
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:03.080]  they just need the information they just need good solid information
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:07.000]  and they need some alternatives instead of i don't think there's anything wrong
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.800]  with being against stuff but you know you hear people come out and say
[2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:12.680]  well you guys are just against things all the time well
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:16.200]  okay if that's a problem for some people let's give them some alternatives in
[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:19.240]  addition to being against like the real idea
[2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:23.240]  let's tell them what the alternative is that would be better and there are some
[2:19:23.240 --> 2:19:26.760]  good alternatives out there that how about we're how about we're for
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:30.040]  the right to keep our arms protect ourselves we're for sovereignty we're
[2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:34.520]  for saving the republic we're for not letting offshore banks

[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:10.520]  senators in oklahoma because they're going to be taking
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:14.680]  this up in their committee maybe this coming week and then on the floor right
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:16.920]  away as soon as they pass it out of committee
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:20.360]  once it passes the senate it does not go to the governor it's done
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:24.920]  it's passed it's law so we need to put the pressure on the senate
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:28.600]  let them know that the people really want this they want to pass it they want to
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:32.280]  pass it soon yeah folks the bill number in the senate
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:39.320]  it is the same bill it's hjr 1003 and randy brogdon does have another bill
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:45.640]  that uh is over there it's sjr 10 so mine that's already passed
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:48.440]  it is on a little kind of on the fast track is
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:56.360]  hjr 1003 his bill is sjr 10 and he said they may try tricks
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:25:59.640]  uh because they think that you guys have the votes in the senate tricks
[2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:04.040]  parliamentary tricks to shoot it down what are those tricks
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:09.880]  well i didn't get to hear the interview but um you know the they can try to
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:12.680]  you know there's different little procedures you can
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:16.600]  you can pull um kind of caught me off guard on that one and they can attach it
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:21.800]  to other bills that aren't popular yeah uh i i'll be surprised if they do that
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:24.760]  but i i'll believe anything anymore but i just don't expect that's
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:27.400]  going to happen and especially if people will continue
[2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:30.760]  to call an email we've gotten so many and i appreciate it so much
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:33.800]  but we can't slow down that we've got to pick it up
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:36.840]  take it up to another level i don't think they'll do it i think people are
[2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:39.960]  starting to get the opinion i'm getting comments from legislators
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:43.240]  in oklahoma just left and right they're they're being
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:47.880]  you know put your foot down on the pedal so never mind them breaks let it all
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:53.080]  hang out because we got a run to make yeah
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:57.800]  yeah things are going well let's just keep it up take it up to another level
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:02.600]  absolutely son put your foot down on the pedal never mind them breaks
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:06.040]  because the globalists are coming but i i think this preemptive
[2:27:06.040 --> 2:27:09.320]  letting the feds know and i agree with you we've got to point out
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:12.600]  i mean have you read how many of his administration don't even pay taxes and
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:15.960]  just thumb their nose i mean these people are out of control
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:19.160]  and that's where we're going when you ignore the constitution
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:22.920]  when you ignore the supreme law of land in other words when you don't have
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:27.800]  a set of rules and laws that are above everything else
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:31.160]  it's the rules call the rule of law when you don't have laws that everyone has
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:34.360]  to follow and they're the same for everyone
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:38.680]  they're not a different set for the leaders or the elitist or the
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:42.120]  politicians and another set for the people then
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:45.480]  things work well that way but when you don't have that when you have that
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:49.160]  violated then what you devolve to is you don't
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:52.840]  involve the leaders that do whatever they want to do then they have these laws
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:27:55.640]  that they apply to us whenever they want to apply them
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:27:58.840]  and that's where we're going is we're practically there
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:02.120]  and if the people don't stand up and put their foot down
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:06.360]  and stop this it's just going to be it's going to be like chaos
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:10.760]  and the enemy is testing the water they were about to pass a flatulence
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:14.200]  tax on all farm animals for and then there was so much pressure they backed
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:17.960]  off they were setting up their nap to superhighways they've backed off for
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:20.920]  now but then people say well they're back again
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:25.000]  yeah it's an eternal fight the cost of liberty is eternal vigilance

[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:24.840]  tailor it down to dna but they do have systems that they can beam you with it
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:28.760]  off and on from one of their surveillance blimps and then you get cancer
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:31.880]  yes and that's very similar to what you're speaking of but now they've got it
[2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:36.120]  to where they can as long as they have a dna sample and i you know when i think
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:40.600]  of what he said last night i think of you know you you're very well publicized
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:44.440]  the fact that they've been taking blood samples from babies at birth
[2:35:44.440 --> 2:35:47.480]  basically since 1973 i think you said
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:50.680]  yeah the the austrian statesman said for 44 years
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:53.640]  we have the government documents it's from since
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:57.880]  since 36 years ago all over the western world and it's held in united
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:01.960]  nations and cold spring harbor eugenics laboratories publicly
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:05.560]  yes so so i mean it is being held by those
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:08.760]  that openly say 80 percent of us at least need to be killed
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:12.280]  yes at least more than they illegally did it i mean it's admitted it's illegal
[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:15.400]  that they just did criminal they're criminals yes they step right out in the
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:18.840]  open they they of course it's uh their same old saw these days where they're
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:22.760]  looking at it from is they have the brute force they can do anything they
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:27.560]  want to do they have the means with which to enslave mankind they feel in
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:31.880]  their minds i believe as we speak here they can let it they can let the hammer
[2:36:31.880 --> 2:36:36.760]  down anytime that's their attitude and they have an agenda for to fulfill
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:42.040]  and uh it gets into deeper things as to why they don't move faster but i
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:44.840]  believe at the top there's god he controls them
[2:36:44.840 --> 2:36:49.080]  but alex when it comes to this as well as chemtrails and when it comes to
[2:36:49.080 --> 2:36:53.240]  uh these so-called cell phone towers that they have constructed which also have
[2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:57.880]  this capability okay darpa has openly said uh this was in the
[2:36:57.880 --> 2:37:02.520]  baltimore sun eight years ago and then i saw it again a few months ago
[2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:07.080]  that they are darpa is testing towers but they said just to calm the public
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:10.920]  during emergencies they've got frequencies i mean this is mainstream news
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:15.080]  we know we're in 2009 boys and girls and i mean that sounds like freedom having
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:17.960]  mind control towers i appreciate your call i mean that's
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:21.480]  reasonable these are nice people thank you mark

[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:10.920]  comments are all i'm going to say is this out of the hundreds and hundreds there's
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:15.880]  like 60 pages now of comments the majority of the people
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:20.360]  that are writing in comments i can tell by what they're saying
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:24.520]  that they are they're not gun nuts and you know and all this
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:29.240]  but they are educated people and they read other things and listen to other

[2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:54.360]  hey thanks for being there alex thank you i do have one question though you say
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:58.200]  always to question things and and uh... secondly most important follow the money
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:03.320]  trail i'm wondering what happened to uh... the c a f r
[2:43:03.320 --> 2:43:09.000]  proposal by by uh... walter buren why if congress is so supportive of of
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.800]  instituting all these resolutions they don't bring these two-thirds of the
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:15.240]  money they have available into supporting things that are are going to
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:17.560]  support the constitution and bring back
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:22.680]  uh... the resolutions that they are are say say they're supporting well we need
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:27.400]  to get my film comprehensive annual financial reports exposed out to people
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:30.680]  the state legislatures not the congress federally
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:35.480]  uh... are being educated by us right now and so you need to educate them about
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:38.040]  the double set of books some of them know a lot of them don't the committee
[2:43:38.040 --> 2:43:39.640]  chairman a lot of people do
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:43.720]  and we do expose the scam and call for criminal investigations of the banking
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:46.600]  and state and federal and county financing systems
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:51.880]  and that's what we call for here okay so how can we best support that
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:55.080]  uh... what uh... uh... education
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:43:58.600]  that i think you need to know you know i think you need to write your own
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:00.600]  article with basic facts or
[2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:04.520]  send them links to them uh... my film free on google or youtube
[2:44:04.520 --> 2:44:07.800]  uh... and go to the legislature bring them a copy
[2:44:07.800 --> 2:44:10.840]  and you know it it's it's all part of this awakening
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:14.440]  uh... process just like charles key said we need to point out just simply these
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:16.120]  are criminals in the federal government
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:19.560]  these are lawless thugs who are breaking the law
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:22.600]  point out they are the criminals they are illegitimate i mean
[2:44:22.600 --> 2:44:27.160]  they're ridiculously criminal right out in the open
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:31.400]  everything they're doing that's my point you know that key and and other people
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:34.520]  that are supporting these these resolutions
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:39.400]  knowledgeable about that the cfr uh... funds available or are they
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:42.600]  look i'm not on the searcher sir i'm not on the president i appreciate your

[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:54.760]  and worth trying as hard as we can so you need to call them

[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:37.160]  uh... the research for this really began when uh... when we started doing the
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:40.520]  research for part one and we were interviewing
[2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:44.520]  uh... kind of our chief expert a guy named buff perry
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:48.120]  and uh... buff perry has very close uh...
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:52.520]  associations with the rorick museum and this guy nicholas rorick at least the
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:55.720]  memory of rorick in the history of him and his family
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:47:59.240]  and his affiliation with the fdr administration
[2:47:59.240 --> 2:48:02.440]  and all of the links between rorick fdr
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:06.520]  henry wallace who was the secretary of agriculture and who became the
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:11.560]  vice president uh... and then of course all of their links to manly p hall
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:16.440]  uh... who's you know considered the the masonry's greatest philosopher and so
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:19.880]  on but all of these guys were interacting with each other
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:23.560]  in the nineteen twenties and thirties in the years prior
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:27.400]  to fdr making the decision to put the great seal
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:31.320]  uh... on the back of the dollar bill and then to overhaul the whole design of the
[2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:33.960]  dollar and to come in with all the intricacies
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:35.560]  that are now there
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:39.320]  and when these guys this is a public ritual uh...
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:42.600]  putting this on the dollar bill had been the secret seal for a long time
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:44.760]  they believe this meant that uh... that
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:49.320]  of great part of their new order new world order had been built
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:52.680]  well that's any that's the way that it comes across if you read the official
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:54.760]  history from the state department
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:56.760]  and we document it in the film
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:00.120]  the account that the state department gives on the history of the great seal
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:02.600]  and it it going to the back of the dollar bill
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:06.760]  uh... talks about how henry wallace side and wallace apparently at least in the
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:07.720]  account
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:10.120]  acts as though he'd never seen it before
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:13.640]  and he thought it was very powerful and of course he was a thirty second degree
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:14.800]  mason
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:16.960]  and so he brought it to fdr
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:20.080]  was also a thirty second degree mason at the time
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:24.080]  and fdr reacted to it as though he had never seen it
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:25.360]  and they both
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:29.360]  believed that the new order of the ages the novice or to cichlorin
[2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:32.640]  and fdr's idea for the new deal
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:34.560]  uh... were one of the same thing
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.120]  and now they're saying we're on the verge of a global new deal
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:41.080]  which is a global bank ruling the united states
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:44.120]  and every other country in the world this is being trumpeted everywhere so
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:48.000]  it's key to study this to understand now they believe they're finally bringing in
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.200]  the final world government
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:55.160]  and they're repeatedly associating barack obama with fdr and they're calling
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:56.880]  him the next fdr
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:00.520]  and he said three times in his in his acceptance speech in his swearing
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:01.760]  instance speech
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:05.000]  the new age is here
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:08.240]  yeah he's continually making reference to the new ages
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:11.720]  it's almost like they're totally letting their hair down at this point
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:15.880]  and uh... and just just coming out with it but yes this is what they've planned
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:17.160]  to do all along
[2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:19.160]  and they're becoming more and more
[2:50:19.160 --> 2:50:20.560]  uh... open about it
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:23.960]  now of course this new age means most of us are going to be killed
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:27.000]  but right now everybody's giggling and happily running down to the guillotine
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.080]  is not having an idea that uh...
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:33.200]  but but let's go to the film we come back of this is very exciting the film is
[2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:34.280]  excellent

[2:54:45.160 --> 2:54:48.240]  message of america's beginnings volume three eye of the phoenix secrets of the
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:53.320]  dollar bill you know I shouldn't even really ask a lot of questions and I've
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:54:56.120]  researched this but you guys have gone to another level of that in different
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:54:59.960]  perspective just just break down the basics and then let's go through what
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:04.360]  this I is what the new world order is you know why they put it on the dollar
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:08.440]  bill and then how this ties into Obama today and then I go through some of the
[2:55:08.440 --> 2:55:15.760]  film itself it's just amazing you guys go ahead you've got the floor go ahead
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:22.280]  David well the we we show that the same you know that the same message that we
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:29.160]  thought that we that we just went that we told in riddleton stone is shown in
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:32.880]  the in the medium of the dollar bill and that is that the masonic you know
[2:55:32.880 --> 2:55:43.760]  fraternity you know back in 1776 in that area or in that era decided to to
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:49.800]  establish America as the new Atlantis as a nation that would gradually lead the
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:54.000]  rest of the world into the you know into the new world order and then stage
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:56:00.400]  their their masonic messiah that's the that's the message on the of the street
[2:56:00.400 --> 2:56:04.040]  layouts and the paintings and the sculptures of Washington DC as we told
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:08.000]  in riddleton stone and that's the message on the dollar bill you know all
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:12.480]  the symbolism of the one dollar bill it's the same message it's the same
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:19.680]  story and regarding the the currency itself and at the end of this video we
[2:56:19.680 --> 2:56:25.160]  show that the the eagle on the back of the dollar bill was really the Egyptian
[2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:32.320]  phoenix bird and and of course that bird at the at the appointed time you know
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:38.640]  dies and it's it's it's expected to die and its body burst into flame and out of
[2:56:38.640 --> 2:56:44.240]  the ashes come a new phoenix bird and we show that you know our belief that the
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:49.280]  that the that the dollar bill was designed to be as the phoenix phoenix
[2:56:49.280 --> 2:56:54.800]  bird and at the end of the of the period go into destruction and dissolve and out
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:59.240]  of that destruction will come the global currency in the global new world order
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:04.360]  and then Albert Pike wrote this in the 1760s and 70s founder of the Klan
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:09.080]  Confederate General Grand Commander Manly P. Hall wrote this and I talked to
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:13.000]  Masons and they don't even know about this I mean they're not being secretive
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:16.800]  they just deny it and can't believe it because they're porch masons and now
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:24.320]  we're here the destruction your take on this Chris Pinto well I think the the
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:28.000]  important part about the symbolism of the phoenix especially as it pertains to
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:33.320]  FDR's administration is that Manly Hall was the guy who was writing all of this
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:38.720]  stuff in his books he was the one who was describing the American Eagle as an
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:43.320]  Egyptian phoenix bird that it was a cleverly disguised phoenix and and all
[2:57:43.320 --> 2:57:48.360]  of the symbolism that goes with it now FDR right after the bombing of Pearl
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:54.200]  Harbor apparently sent emissaries to Manly Hall's library to microfish all
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:57:59.920]  of his materials and the chief things that Hall was writing about during that
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:04.480]  era were had to do with the secret destiny of America and how secret
[2:58:04.480 --> 2:58:09.080]  societies had planned America as the new Atlantis and and it was going to
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:15.360]  develop into this one world democratic systems supposedly and this was all what
[2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:19.480]  you know FDR seems to have been influenced by because he's talking about
[2:58:19.480 --> 2:58:24.440]  the destiny of America in his writings well so we've got a break back in one
[2:58:24.440 --> 2:58:29.440]  minute we see the same thing from of course Woodrow Wilson writing the book
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:33.000]  The New World Order and then before he died saying I was con it's all a scam
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:37.280]  it's evil you know he because they suck in people about how loving and good it
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:41.440]  is but at the end they find out it's a very dark God

[3:00:18.360 --> 3:00:30.800]  okay David Bay Chris Pentum I have the Phoenix Seekers of the dollar bill you
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:36.400]  were continuing on Chris with the destruction of the United States the
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:41.160]  rise of world government please continue yeah it's just very interesting you know
[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:45.400]  I've been I've been reading articles just about the planned destruction of
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:49.080]  America in fact there was that book I think about 10 years ago by James
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:54.400]  Wardner by that title and I remember when I first started hearing about this it
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:59.800]  sounded too incredible to be believed you know a family member of mine you know
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:03.920]  called me who had been skeptical about this and then talked about watching a
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:09.560]  video presentation that dated back in 1995 where somebody was talking about the
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:14.600]  financial situation America and how that they were planning the destruction of our
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.640]  economy and it seems too incredible to be believed but then when the housing
[3:01:19.640 --> 3:01:24.200]  market crashed and then you have China and France coming out calling for global
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:29.800]  currency and a new world order and then Henry Kissinger coming forward and
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:34.600]  talking about how Obama's positioned for the establishment of a new world order
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:38.960]  it says though everything is happening right on cue right according to some
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:44.560]  greater plan and I think the symbolism we we talk in at great length about the
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:50.200]  you know the esoteric symbolism of the symbols on the dollar bill and what they
[3:01:50.200 --> 3:01:57.280]  may well have meant to men like Hall to Nicholas Rorick to Henry Wallace and
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:04.320]  FDR and that collectively they would have symbolized this destruction of a you
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:09.440]  know of a phoenix that then leads to a rebirth and that by destroying America's
[3:02:09.440 --> 3:02:14.760]  currency and possibly America itself I mean there was just yesterday Glenn Beck
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:20.960]  on Fox News had a quote that was sent out by Rupert Murdoch I don't know if you
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:24.280]  guys caught this but it was very interesting now we caught it about how
[3:02:24.280 --> 3:02:29.200]  that's a new order is upon us right where we know that is upon us well
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:36.080]  government you know I don't want that it does not exist sees him right but it's
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:40.520]  just incredible how everybody is just stepping forward as though they they
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:47.600]  all know what what is supposed to happen right on cue and and now the you know
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:52.760]  things move forward but yeah that's that's generally but we're talking
[3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:57.520]  about an eye of the phoenix is all of the undercurrent for these things and how
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:03.160]  they materialize through the 20th century we we sidestep carefully because
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:07.320]  a lot of the debates about the dollar bill have to do with the founding fathers
[3:03:07.320 --> 3:03:11.480]  of America and what the founding fathers intended and that's very difficult to
[3:03:11.480 --> 3:03:16.080]  discern when you when you focus on the great seal and trying to figure out what
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:20.800]  they intended for the symbolism there because you had 14 different men that
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:26.240]  worked on three committees and then all of their work was handed over to one
[3:03:26.240 --> 3:03:31.320]  man Charles Thompson who then comes up with the final seal design and he
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:36.400]  submits it to Congress in a written form it's just a written description he had
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:40.520]  some preliminary sketches but ultimately it was all just written down
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:45.880]  Congress approved that and then you had these realizations of the seal that came
[3:03:45.880 --> 3:03:51.080]  about but they were all slightly different but the the formal design the
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:54.960]  one that you know we see on the internet and the people write about and talk
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:04:00.120]  about that has all of this precision to it and this masonic and occult imagery
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:05.960]  that was made formal during FDR's administration that's where things like
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:12.160]  the stars above the eagle's head went from being just a loose star field into
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:18.840]  a hexagram with a circle around it like the star of David and so on and then so
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:23.720]  we've got one of our you know occult experts Doc Marquis who comes in and
[3:04:23.720 --> 3:04:29.600]  explains the series of hexagrams that he finds come back a long segment putting
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:32.400]  your time to talk when come back we'll break this down but you're reading the
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:37.200]  Bible Solomon seal that's not the star of David it's the seal they sealed it
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:41.240]  you know the the devils with or the or the genies whether you believe in this
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:45.880]  or not that's what they say and they believe these symbols have power need
[3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:50.960]  to be need to be shown like the Washington monument the big phallus in
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:54.960]  in the capitals of the breast of the goddess with the goddess you know capping
[3:04:54.960 --> 3:04:58.640]  them and they're and they're bringing all of this in we'll talk about their
[3:04:58.640 --> 3:05:03.600]  fruits when we come back have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo

[3:08:20.800 --> 3:08:31.400]  Alex Jones this film also deals with these theosophic societies that just
[3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:36.920]  carry on the ancient Babylon mission religion who are searching the world
[3:08:36.920 --> 3:08:41.080]  for their Christ and they claim that many different people have been this
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:46.240]  Maitreya one of them that they announced was their leader in the 2030s 40s 50s
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:50.320]  is the guy that you see in the new zeitgeist addendum and then all the
[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:53.320]  symbolism and that's we also a lot of these groups now coming into the
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:57.240]  Patriot or Awakening movement and they say that this you know this Christ is
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:01.680]  coming and the churches have been you know prepared for that they've been
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:04.280]  told support Israel no matter what Israel does but the Bible says the
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:09.400]  Antichrist will be there first posing so this is just amazing deception that's
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:12.600]  going on a lot of people then say well you know the Babylon Mystery School
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:19.400]  people kind of planted the Bible as ideas to be a type of predictive
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:23.120]  programming to where this will be manifest but but if you really read
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:30.240]  deeper this is a another counterfeit lie they're putting out and expanding on
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:36.760]  that they believe that they need to get rid of the majority of the world's
[3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:40.720]  population so if you look at the fruits of the New World Order and the high
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:45.320]  level nations which is one arm of this very horrible fruits very very
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:50.160]  horrible things they do incredible human degradation and they rationalize it
[3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.960]  saying it's the balance you know it's it's bringing balance to things but
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:59.680]  continuing with our guest chris pinto and david bay the makers by the phoenix
[3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:05.040]  and again incredible film continue chris pinto and then david bay along these
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:11.600]  lines breaking down the film and let's go back into the film itself in the end
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:17.320]  what these people in their own writings say they believe I think a lot of it
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:20.960]  what we really tried to show you know in their writings you were talking about
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:27.040]  the connection with theosophical society and during this time there were you had
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:31.880]  Henry Wallace who was the secretary of agriculture becomes the vice president
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:37.840]  later on and he was a member of the theosophical society and with him his
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:43.320]  spiritual mentor a guy named Nicholas Rorick who's been sort of erased from
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:48.240]  modern history books but was a very central figure back in the 1920s and
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:54.280]  30s and was very closely associated with FDR's administration and he was seen
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:11:00.000]  to be the the successor of madam blavatsky who had founded the theosophical
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.080]  society in the late 19th century and his wife in fact Helena Rorick had
[3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:12.920]  translated blavatsky's book the secret doctrine into Russian so they were very
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:17.160]  very closely affiliated with the society and they ended up forming their own
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:21.960]  new age group called the Agni yoga society and so on but Rorick was this
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:28.240]  celebrated international figure he was a painter he was a philosopher and so on
[3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:34.600]  he was very deeply involved in the occult and as a result Henry Wallace who
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:39.760]  was his his pupil his disciple became deeply involved in the occult as well
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:44.400]  and Rorick spent years of his life traveling through eastern countries
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:50.680]  through Tibet and so on looking for looking for Shambhala this legendary
[3:11:50.680 --> 3:11:55.720]  you know paradise like kingdom but also looking for signs of the coming of the
[3:11:55.720 --> 3:12:02.200]  Christ you know the the the fifth Buddha the matreya and this was a central
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:06.920]  doctrine in the whole theosophical belief system but you had major figures you
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:11.640]  had guys like Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru the first Prime Minister of India that
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:16.800]  were both involved in theosophy yeah Thomas Edison the great inventor who
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:20.880]  was a member of the House of Theosophy and so on so there were a lot of
[3:12:20.880 --> 3:12:26.640]  intellectuals and and and the the group itself was very political it formed the
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:32.960]  underbelly of the League of Nations of which Rorick is credited for for having
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:37.560]  been an inspiration of and then subsequently when you know that was
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:42.320]  dissolved and the UN came together Rorick is credited you know his whole
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:47.520]  philosophies and so on about world peace and world brotherhood he was through his
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:54.040]  artwork and his writings amalgamating all the different cultures of the world in
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:12:58.600]  his paintings and so on you know so he's combining Jesus and Buddha and
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:13:04.360]  Krishna and Muhammad and so on and and relying upon these universal archetypes
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:09.040]  as being you know different parts of one in the same thing now this is just their
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:11.840]  front though I mean specifically studying I mean you go into that some of the
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:16.400]  film there's this very dark side and you find that dark side at the top of the
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:23.960]  pyramid oh yeah oh yeah yeah the I think the the dark side comes in well
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:28.680]  for me anyway the dark side comes in with this artifact that Rorick claimed to
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:34.640]  have this the stone that was delivered to him and that we revealed through the
[3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:39.160]  course of the film was a stone that was said to have fallen from the crown of
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:45.400]  Lucifer the archangel and we talk about the how the underbelly of theosophy is
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:50.600]  really the worship of Lucifer Satan declaring that Lucifer is the true God
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:57.600]  and Madame Blavatsky and her writings had talked about the belief of the
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:02.520]  theosophists which was ancient Gnosticism which is goes back to the
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:07.840]  Garden of Eden and she uses this phrase demon s dayus inversus meaning the
[3:14:07.840 --> 3:14:14.040]  devil is God inverted and they switch the roles of God and the serpent in the
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:19.280]  Garden of Eden and they declare that God who created Adam and Eve was really a
[3:14:19.280 --> 3:14:25.640]  devil because he forbade man to partake of the tree of knowledge and the serpent
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:32.160]  was really an angel of light Lucifer who came to redeem mankind by getting him
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:36.000]  to partake of the tree of knowledge okay so they say they're so loving and good
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.400]  why do they will love slaughtering and killing and whole populations why I
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:44.920]  mean I guess the mother earth needs that well because they're a luciferian
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:51.320]  we you know we show that the that both thought that both seals are Luciferian
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:57.520]  and Egyptian in origin and Kerry and then when when when our we have a couple
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:03.680]  of experts that that break down the symbolism on both sides and and we
[3:15:03.680 --> 3:15:09.200]  prove we just prove that that that the symbolism of the dollar bill is Luciferian
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:15.400]  that you know to its very core you know what what was really interesting to me
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:23.600]  is that is not the Nicholas Rorick who who is a channeler and a mystic channeler
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:28.800]  spirits and his wife was doing but it wasn't you know I wasn't so surprised
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:34.640]  that he believed that this stone contained Lucifer's power and that he who
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:40.360]  held it would would have that power and that power could move the world into the
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:45.000]  new world order but what was interesting to me is that Henry Wallace who is
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:50.240]  secretary of agriculture and vice president under under FDR believed the
[3:15:50.240 --> 3:15:55.320]  same thing and then meanwhile meanwhile David Bay you have Hitler part of the
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:16:01.280]  theosophic society running around trying to find different artifacts and and
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:04.520]  one of you's got a phone short whoever's moving that I just may have to switch
[3:16:04.520 --> 3:16:11.360]  phones that the he had to run around and get all these amulets and talismans and
[3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:15.880]  the and the shroud of Turin and the in the the spear that pierced Christ's
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:21.280]  side in the holy grail and Tibet Nazis digging things up and Tunis and running
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:24.880]  around whether people believe that this stuff's real or not the lunatics
[3:16:24.880 --> 3:16:28.800]  running things I've been to Bohemian Grove I snuck in there I mean that
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:34.880]  skull and bones they really do believe in this please continue yeah well you the
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:41.160]  the thing we try to try to bring out in this or you know in this video is that
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:50.240]  FDR was extremely was extremely you know much like Hitler in the fact that he
[3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:54.960]  that that he believed in the same things and in and in and he was sending
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:17:02.760]  Nicholas Rorick all throughout you know the the Far East to to discover many of
[3:17:02.760 --> 3:17:07.200]  the same things as Hitler and so did Stalin and so did Lenin and so did the
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:14.120]  British royalty right and then Tony Blair today skull and bones all of these
[3:17:14.120 --> 3:17:19.840]  groups are completely and totally obsessed with this exactly exactly but
[3:17:19.840 --> 3:17:26.920]  you know people do not realize the from the deep occult religion for the lack
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:31.080]  of a better term of the FDR administration from FDR down to Henry
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:37.680]  Wallace and and well look at Lincoln at seances and channeling he did his wife
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:43.000]  is especially deep into that yes look at look at Ronald Reagan yeah I mean it's
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:17:50.400]  Hillary he he bragged that she had seances with with Eleanor Roosevelt I
[3:17:50.400 --> 3:17:55.200]  mean there's all this the Rorick's were so deep into this though I think it's
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:00.040]  interesting they were so deep into this that they were claiming in their diaries
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:04.880]  that they were having objects materialized from the spirit realm they
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:09.880]  were having coins and other things from the spirit realm come into their seances
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:14.320]  and then very serious I mean these are people who are international figures
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:19.280]  that are impacting world government and they're claiming that these spirits are
[3:18:19.280 --> 3:18:25.520]  sending things from the other side to them so so they they these were not
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:29.920]  light-hearted accounts that were given these people were were deeply involved
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:34.480]  in the worship of Lucifer and they're in control of the nuclear weapons the
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:38.600]  bio weapons they're getting everybody's DNA admittedly to create race specific
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:41.960]  bio weapons right they're in control today and they are going to kill a lot of
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:52.520]  people folks yep continue so that's that that that I felt was a very important
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:56.720]  thing to prove because a lot of people I've seen some Christian ministries even
[3:18:56.720 --> 3:19:02.240]  trying to defend FDR as possibly being a Christian because he'll make you know he
[3:19:02.240 --> 3:19:06.240]  made certain speeches at Christmas or this kind of thing talking about the
[3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:10.640]  birth of Christ and whatnot and not realizing that as a Mason and as
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:13.560]  somebody deeply involved in all this stuff he would have a completely
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:21.200]  different view of of who Christ was and what he represented and so on and and
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:27.080]  also the the strong Masonic connection with his entire administration with him
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:35.480]  with Wallace with the the secretary of Treasury with a guy named Lewis Horch who
[3:19:35.480 --> 3:19:41.560]  was financing Nicholas Rorick and built this huge building for him he had
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:47.120]  government positions there with FDR and he was a 33rd degree Mason all of these
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:51.600]  guys were deeply involved in this Chris Pinto David Bay got a break let's come

[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:37.680]  reaching down when the man comes around one of the biggest issues I've noticed
[3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:43.440]  is that the occultist the rose accruesians all these groups basic same
[3:24:43.440 --> 3:24:51.800]  religion run the atheistic agnostic groups the humanist groups and also have
[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:54.720]  infiltrated all the seminaries they brag about it in their books as you men
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:25:01.160]  know and they're obsessed with discrediting true Christianity but then
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:04.560]  you know they're a bunch of occultics why do they accept all the other
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:08.120]  religions except for that but but I mean that's a whole another question I want
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:10.960]  to run through some of the other characters in the film but also want to
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:14.520]  spend time on how they from your research how they plan on destroying the
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:17.840]  United States and then rebuilding it to bring in their new world order but please
[3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:27.320]  continue with our guest David Bay and Chris Pinto okay I think one of the guys
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:30.520]  is listening to the radio over the internet delay that's probably David
[3:25:30.520 --> 3:25:35.720]  Bay let's go back to Chris Pinto crush you there yeah I'm here yeah I'll go
[3:25:35.720 --> 3:25:45.000]  ahead okay yeah we again I have a Phoenix is part 3 part 1 we wanted to
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:50.520]  talk about the foundation of America you know going back to England and and this
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:55.000]  is the birth of the new Atlantis and viewing it that way what's in it what
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:59.160]  was interesting to me was discovering that the very first history of the
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:03.800]  great seal that was written was written by a guy named Charles A. L. Totten in
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:09.840]  the 19th century and he was an American Army officer and he had when he's
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:13.400]  writing about the great seal he's writing about the mysteries that are
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:16.280]  associated with the founding of our republic and there's a lot of them
[3:26:16.280 --> 3:26:20.880]  there's a lot of really you know interesting mythical fairy tales that
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:25.480]  are told about angels visiting George Washington and mysterious figures
[3:26:25.480 --> 3:26:30.320]  coming from out of nowhere and doing certain things to you know inspire the
[3:26:30.320 --> 3:26:35.760]  signers of the Declaration of Independence Providence Providence exactly
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:41.000]  or so they would call it but not necessarily all of them but Totten in
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:44.680]  his history of the great seal writes about it and he talks about the birth of
[3:26:44.680 --> 3:26:50.000]  America and he says specifically that he believed it was the fulfillment of what
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:55.680]  Sir Francis Bacon had called the new Atlantis so he ties it all together in
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:01.760]  his history and one of the things that we talk about in the film is the one of
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:06.160]  the mysterious origins or said to be origins of the great seal some people
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:09.760]  have argued that you can't really know where the great seal came from because
[3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:14.640]  so many fingers were involved in it in designing it and so they put forth this
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:19.560]  notion that it came from the spirit realm that it materialized and there's
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:25.000]  actually a history that's documented in a book Founding Fathers Secret
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:30.240]  Societies by Dr. Robert Heronimus now the the the account might not mean
[3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:34.280]  anything except for the fact that Heronimus is the leading expert in
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:38.680]  America and probably the world on the history of the great seal he's the guy
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:43.400]  whose research is used by the State Department by the White House it was
[3:27:43.400 --> 3:27:49.440]  given to Anwar Sadat years ago before he was assassinated when Sadat was
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:52.680]  inquiring about the great seal because he saw the pyramid and he thought there
[3:27:52.680 --> 3:27:59.120]  was some connection between Egypt and America as a result and anyway so Dr.
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:05.600]  Heronimus records this history where Thomas Jefferson with John Adams and
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:08.720]  Ben Franklin were supposedly trying to come up with a design for the great
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:15.520]  seal and in their frustration Jefferson goes outside and some mysterious
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:23.920]  figure in a dark cloak comes out of nowhere and has this something in a
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:28.240]  satchel and he hands it to Jefferson and he says I know you've been struggling
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:34.600]  for a you know to come up with a design here it is and Jefferson supposedly
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:39.600]  opens this pack up and and there's the design for the great seal of the United
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:43.280]  States and he goes rushing in tells everybody about it and when he comes
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:50.080]  back this mysterious figure is gone and it's a it's a really bizarre account but
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:54.360]  it's a recorded account and there are people who to this day claim to believe
[3:28:54.360 --> 3:28:58.280]  that that's where the the great seal originates of course it doesn't just
[3:28:58.280 --> 3:29:02.120]  in there and I would say somebody's got a phone off the hook in an office we
[3:29:02.120 --> 3:29:05.560]  keep hearing a woman talk and I'm just gonna put that on record here cuz I'll
[3:29:05.560 --> 3:29:08.160]  be able to hear what you guys have to say I'm not sure which phones doing that
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:13.880]  so I need to check it that there's a cultic symbolism all over DC all over
[3:29:13.880 --> 3:29:18.200]  the world and all over the other money as well it's just everywhere they're
[3:29:18.200 --> 3:29:23.000]  upsetting the National Press Club symbolism is the staff of the wizard
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:28.200]  the little owl the eternal flame of Bohemian Grove it just goes on and on
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:30.840]  so let's talk about that gentlemen when we come back and take some phone calls
[3:29:30.840 --> 3:29:35.640]  and what their great plan is from your deep research on this subject just an
[3:29:35.640 --> 3:29:39.720]  amazing film you can go up to info wars.com reposible.com watch the trailer

[3:33:13.360 --> 3:33:17.920]  I have a phoenix secrets of the dollar bill your phone calls coming up in a few
[3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:21.240]  minutes I gotta have our guests back on for more in-depth interview because there's
[3:33:21.240 --> 3:33:25.920]  just so much to learn here again I came upon researching the new order just from
[3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:31.360]  a secular position looking at what the elites believe are pushing and these are
[3:33:31.360 --> 3:33:35.920]  horrible creatures and they have a lot of well-meaning idiot camp followers that
[3:33:35.920 --> 3:33:39.200]  buy into the whole new age there's nothing new about it let's hit some of
[3:33:39.200 --> 3:33:44.880]  the other key areas of the eye the phoenix and perhaps I should go back to
[3:33:44.880 --> 3:33:48.680]  David May for his take on some of the things that Chris Pinto was just saying
[3:33:48.680 --> 3:33:52.400]  but then also I want to go back to Chris Pinto because the way these films are
[3:33:52.400 --> 3:33:55.720]  made I mean this is shot with actors it's lit right yeah I don't know how you
[3:33:55.720 --> 3:33:59.120]  guys do it for the budget you have it's just an amazing feat they do it three
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:07.520]  times the the credit for that all goes to Chris he's a he's an accomplished
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:13.280]  filmmaker and and you know what once he became a Christian he realized he couldn't
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:17.960]  work for Hollywood so now he's using his skills you know for us so that that
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:25.220]  credit all goes to him but the the were one of the major points comes at the
[3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:31.520]  end of the film where we disclose that there is a direct link between the
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:35.600]  symbolism of the all-seeing eye of Lucifer hovering over the unfinished
[3:34:35.600 --> 3:34:42.280]  pyramid which is the the developing new world order and the the Masonic plan to
[3:34:42.280 --> 3:34:48.520]  rebuild the Solomon's temple for their Christ and when the Christ arises he
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:54.280]  will symbolically replace the eye of top the pyramid thus thus completing the
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:35:01.360]  pyramid so back in in 1782 when this design was created the Mason at the
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:07.960]  time and the Masons today planned to to to rebuild that third temple for their
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:13.200]  Christ and that symbolism is on the dollar bill and they have the Israeli
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:16.240]  Supreme Court building with the big all-seeing eyes and they've infiltrated
[3:35:16.240 --> 3:35:21.320]  Christianity and changed things to a pre-tribulation rapture and so the
[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:26.280]  Christian church is ready to accept the first Christ as the Christ exactly right
[3:35:26.280 --> 3:35:31.920]  that's exactly right and that's a war a warning that we issue in riddles and
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:36.320]  stones were the end of that of that documentary but but the point is that
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:44.080]  this plan to go to to globalize the world and and I've been you know and
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:49.240]  been been staged their Christ this plan has been in existence for since at least
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:54.960]  their founding fathers and and we show him in in the New Atlantis the first
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:36:00.360]  video all it goes off the plan goes all the way back to Sir Francis Bacon and
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:05.840]  Queen Elizabeth in England in the 1580s and 1590s so this is a long-running
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:14.520]  plan it's just amazing to see it unfolding now the Luciferians Mr. Pinto
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:20.400]  they believe that they are now in the final phase correct I think they do I
[3:36:20.400 --> 3:36:25.360]  mean they've got you've had these guys coming out for years stating that their
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:30.680]  world teacher their matriah their global messiah is getting ready to merge at any
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:35.440]  moment I mean back in FDRs era they believe that was the case this guy
[3:36:35.440 --> 3:36:41.400]  Krishnamurti who I think you mentioned earlier was the you know the guy that the
[3:36:41.400 --> 3:36:44.680]  House of Theosophy believed was going to be the Christ figure and then he came
[3:36:44.680 --> 3:36:49.880]  out and said no it's not me then you've had Benjamin Crem who for more than 20
[3:36:49.880 --> 3:36:55.000]  years almost 30 years now has been going forth announcing that the matriah
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:59.400]  would appear at any moment and this matriah is the same you know fifth
[3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:05.560]  Buddha Christ figure that they were anticipating during FDRs administration
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:10.480]  and Lucifer trust now Lucius trust has a little area at the UN in New York I
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:15.080]  mean this is their religion yeah the meditation room if anybody goes to the
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:19.560]  UN I've been to the meditation room in the United Nations building it is I mean
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:24.920]  it is a it is a very occult room that they put together and if you go on their
[3:37:24.920 --> 3:37:30.440]  website and read about it it's just it's it's very plain that that it was
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:35.600]  designed based on occult principles in no uncertain way but yeah they've been
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:41.040]  anticipating this figure in fact Benjamin Crem back in November share
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:46.000]  international his group sent out some email and some news announcement now
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.160]  that there was that is actually after the election once Obama won the election
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:55.440]  within a month they sent some press release announcing that matriah was
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:59.340]  going to emerge that he was going to be interviewed by some world famous
[3:37:59.340 --> 3:38:03.960]  journalist or something and then all of these miraculous and wondrous things
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:08.920]  were going to be happening in the coming year supposedly this year but Crem
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:12.200]  has been saying this kind of thing for many years so who knows what's gonna
[3:38:12.200 --> 3:38:19.120]  happen but but yes they they they think the time is nigh they believe they are
[3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:25.000]  right on the right on the edge of this whole new world order coming about and
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:31.320]  their world teacher coming forward bunch of lunatics I want to go to some phone
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:34.560]  calls but I want to tell listeners who haven't gotten the first two in the
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:38.440]  series we have all three at info wars dot com right now secret mysteries of
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:42.240]  America's beginnings volume one riddles and stone secret missions of America's
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:47.280]  beginnings to and now the third eye of the phoenix secrets of the dollar bill
[3:38:47.280 --> 3:38:50.880]  in memory serves me right you guys wanted to make one film early on but you
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:56.360]  understood it was such a saga such a history that I mean I watched all three
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:39:00.560]  films and you know it's just jam packed with info you never cover the same
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:06.880]  info twice how many total in the series are they're gonna be there were there
[3:39:06.880 --> 3:39:11.600]  were originally going to be four if we can find the funding for it we would
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:17.640]  buy you know the the the material has blossomed into seven so you will just
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:22.640]  have to wait and see how things progress but there is so much material that we
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:26.240]  need to talk about relating to the secret mysteries of America's beginnings
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:31.120]  now that it could take seven volumes to tell the whole story that's it's real
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:33.840]  education because I've done a lot of research and I even learned a lot of
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:37.800]  this stuff I didn't know watching these films it's also all very well
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:41.040]  documented I want to take a few calls here but any other key points you guys
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:46.920]  want to make about the film did you notice the bohemian owl though that we
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:50.840]  did that we talked about all over that dollar bill yes tell us about that
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:56.760]  little fellow well hidden in the in a couple different places in on the dollar
[3:39:56.760 --> 3:40:02.920]  bill there is an owl that is identical to the bohemian grove owl and and we
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:07.040]  have a short segment in there about the bohemian grove which ties in exactly
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:12.080]  with your with with your dvd of you know on that subject I found that I found it
[3:40:12.080 --> 3:40:15.920]  very interesting that that that the documentary that the fact of the
[3:40:15.920 --> 3:40:21.040]  documentary took that turn yeah well you know people say to me oh the owl is
[3:40:21.040 --> 3:40:26.440]  in Molek I understand that that was symbolized entire as a bull in other
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:31.720]  areas as a ram other animals but the cultists always give two three four five
[3:40:31.720 --> 3:40:36.680]  ten meanings they address it as the owl of bohemian and then on their own
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:41.480]  literature they address it as Molek when I was there at the ritual cut you know
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:46.600]  infiltrating it in July of 2000 they addressed it first they said the
[3:40:46.600 --> 3:40:49.800]  spirits of all our dead grove members are here and they addressed it as a
[3:40:49.800 --> 3:40:54.320]  female and they dress it as a male I mean this this goes into their religion
[3:40:54.320 --> 3:40:58.280]  and it and a lot of the occultists out there like to you know picket us and I
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:01.680]  like we're not allowed to talk about this and all their mumbo jumbo garbage
[3:41:01.680 --> 3:41:09.400]  but any comments on that well I want the young go ahead Chris now I was just
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:12.840]  gonna make the comment Alex just to follow up on the whole owl bohemian
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:17.320]  growth thing one of the things that we show in the film is is the the presence
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:22.400]  of the owl throughout Washington DC if you go in the government buildings if
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:26.880]  you go in the Library of Congress in the US Capitol and so on you will find
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:34.800]  little owls carved into you know the most remote places inside DC I mean
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:39.760]  they're all over the place we feel probably spiritual guardians yeah the
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:45.240]  practicing occultism believe that the former that that a particularly
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:51.720]  powerful kind of familiar spirit takes the form of an owl and and the owl was
[3:41:51.720 --> 3:41:57.040]  Sir Francis Bacon's favorite familiar spirit and so it's been popular all
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:01.560]  down through all that through the sensory sense yeah I had a pretty high-level
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:06.680]  mason's you know here in Texas in my family lineage and you know in these
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:10.840]  old farmhouses in places there's little you know bronze and cast iron little
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:17.920]  owls and big yeah that's a familiar spirit that comes and guides them and
[3:42:17.920 --> 3:42:22.360]  gives them encouragement give them give them guidance for their life and that
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:27.640]  kind of thing it's and of course the Bible says that we are to not have any
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:35.080]  contact with familiar spirits so but it's it's you know it's a representative
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:40.800]  of this Luciferian religion that all of the of the mason's and Rosa
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:45.360]  Crucians and other members of secret societies follow if people really got a
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:50.480]  hold in their mind that our government leaders are you know these mason's and
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:55.600]  these Rosa Crucians are practicing occultists and are following a cult
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:00.880]  plan to follow Bible prophecy then you know what that would revolutionize the
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:04.320]  the opposition in the New World Order and that's what the Bible says it says
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:08.680]  they have their counterfeit and the occultists go no this is the Christ you
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:12.680]  know look we know we wrote your Bible I mean it's just such deception it's just
[3:43:12.680 --> 3:43:18.760]  amazing yes it is it's amazing but the the exciting part of it for us is that
[3:43:18.760 --> 3:43:23.760]  is that this all comes down and they are they are aiming for the very thing the
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:29.840]  Bible says will happen and that is that is a a Christ figure that will claim to
[3:43:29.840 --> 3:43:34.400]  be Jesus Christ and all the world's religions and and will take control of
[3:43:34.400 --> 3:43:38.360]  a global government a global economy and a global religion well let me look at
[3:43:38.360 --> 3:43:42.240]  how the last two popes are calling for a one-world government I have video of
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:46.720]  them joining hands with all the other religions I mean they mean they're all
[3:43:46.720 --> 3:43:53.520]  pushing for this yeah and the the the the Illuminati back in 1991 made a
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:57.760]  decision that that the the Roman Catholic Pope
[3:43:57.760 --> 3:44:02.800]  whomever he was at the time would become the top religious leader of the New
[3:44:02.800 --> 3:44:07.760]  World Order religion and so the Pope is right in the thick of things
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:12.080]  you know all right yeah well we have all three of the films available at info
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:15.840]  wars.com I hope you'll call and get it as well as your if you're not online 888
[3:44:15.840 --> 3:44:24.600]  2533139 triple 82533139 I of the phoenix let's go ahead and take some
[3:44:24.600 --> 3:44:29.080]  calls Ron in Arizona you're on the air with the two co-directors of Eye of the
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:36.760]  Phoenix good afternoon gentlemen if we're living in the last days and a new
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:44.840]  world order will be established as the Bible says should we resist it no matter
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:50.400]  what because the Bible says we should do that Proverbs 24 25 says that those who
[3:44:50.400 --> 3:44:57.040]  rebuke the will be blessed those who keep the laws strive against the wicked
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:45:03.280]  Proverbs 28 for and if the righteous gives way before the wicked they are
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:09.560]  like a muddy spring or a polluted well Proverbs 25 26 and then Ephesians 5
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:15.600]  11 says that instead of participating in the deeds of the wicked we're supposed
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:21.280]  to expose them and then Paul said in verse 14 awake sleeper and arise from
[3:45:21.280 --> 3:45:26.880]  the dead in Christ will shine on you any comments on that Alex and Mr. Penel
[3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:36.000]  Mr. Bay I think we should resist I you know right now we can resist legally and
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:41.080]  and and you know write letters and call our congressmen and do all the you know
[3:45:41.080 --> 3:45:48.120]  you know talk as you know you know as a million man voice I think we should I
[3:45:48.120 --> 3:45:53.080]  think we should I think we should and but I you know the Christian ministry we
[3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:57.800]  strive to use our events of the new you know that the coming new world order to
[3:45:57.800 --> 3:46:02.440]  get people to come to come price but if they are saved they're gonna be fighting
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:10.040]  evil yeah we have to fight evil I mean it is grace that comes first but the
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:14.400]  evidence of that is that you're gonna fight evil because we're commanded to
[3:46:14.400 --> 3:46:18.160]  throughout the Bible these are just a handful but if you're really fighting
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:21.000]  evil I mean if you're really right with God you're not gonna be able to control
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:24.160]  yourself you're gonna want to help people and fight evil and stand up against
[3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.480]  corruption you're not gonna be a coward and I'm telling you I go in these
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:32.480]  churches and I feel an evil I mean it just an it's evil most these big
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:37.960]  churches it is evil I go in there and I feel evil and and and because it is
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:41.600]  evil I appreciate your call you guys want to comment on that Mr. Pinto
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:46.320]  anybody I just wanted to say one of my favorite scriptures have to do with
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:51.080]  John the Baptist and how how and why John the Baptist was arrested he was
[3:46:51.080 --> 3:46:55.880]  arrested not just for speaking out against King Herod's adultery but the
[3:46:55.880 --> 3:47:00.080]  scripture says he lifted up a shout against all the evil that Herod had
[3:47:00.080 --> 3:47:05.200]  done he had been speaking against all the evil that Herod was guilty of and I
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:08.720]  think that's part of what we're doing in these films and it's it's part of what
[3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:13.280]  we believe is the right thing to do God prophets and wise men and followers have
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:16.800]  always spoken out against evil in the land whenever a king or a queen or
[3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:21.600]  whoever was given over to it you know like Ezekiel said and others they were
[3:47:21.600 --> 3:47:24.360]  threatened to kill him and he said I can't help it my bones are burning I've
[3:47:24.360 --> 3:47:29.400]  got to do this and people don't have a compulsion a drive an overwhelming need
[3:47:29.400 --> 3:47:32.320]  to fight evil and defend all these innocence that are being slaughtered
[3:47:32.320 --> 3:47:37.240]  and enslaved and the captives then you are in league with the force of this
[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:44.440]  world period and Jesus said that too much is given much to be required so for
[3:47:44.440 --> 3:47:48.480]  both of us who know the truth and know the truth behind the truth it's incumbent
[3:47:48.480 --> 3:47:53.400]  upon us to resist absolutely let's talk to Wilson in New York Wilson you're on
[3:47:53.400 --> 3:47:58.000]  the air with our guest yes good evening gentlemen I just want to thank you guys
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:02.200]  for being able to bring together all the information and make it so
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:07.040]  understandable and I also want to thank you Alice Jones for taking me out of my
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:13.520]  dream state of just smoking every day and you turn me into someone who just is
[3:48:13.520 --> 3:48:18.280]  in a drive for information and trying to understand things and things like the
[3:48:18.280 --> 3:48:22.640]  either Phoenix do help me understand things easier so I just have one
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:26.840]  question is um the movie I'm actually reading the book though
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:32.200]  Andrews and Demons talks about a lot of information I was curious if any of that
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:38.560]  information could be true you're talking about the the the the book they're
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:43.240]  turning into the film with about the Illuminati and all that yeah with Tom
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:46.720]  Hanks but by Dan Brown yeah that's really all twisted because it says
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:50.840]  there's the Illuminati but it's but it's fighting Christianity in the Catholic
[3:48:50.840 --> 3:48:53.680]  Church when really all those major institutions are working together
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:59.680]  gentlemen you have comments on that I haven't really studied that that book I
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:03.920]  you know I couldn't comment well I mean you find out in the first one that you
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:06.640]  know it really is the Holy Grail and the Holy Grail is the goddess it's just
[3:49:06.640 --> 3:49:12.600]  very occulting about the New World Order and Builderburg so none of that I
[3:49:12.600 --> 3:49:17.000]  should take seriously you know the the Illuminati love to jump in and muddy the
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  waters and and you know take control of different groups or or write a book that
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:28.560]  is that is partly true and partly false they've they love to do them like this
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:32.000]  maybe that kind of a thing okay sir I've only read a synopsis of the book and
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:35.640]  the film I read the first one I'll listen to it on the book on tape because I
[3:49:35.640 --> 3:49:40.000]  want to understand it our uh let me guess they say the Catholic Church is
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:43.280]  fighting the Illuminati in the book
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:51.240]  did they explain that that Adam Weissop came out of a Jesuit college in
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:57.640]  Ingolstadt, Bavaria that he was a he began as a Jesuit and he used to use the
[3:49:57.640 --> 3:50:03.440]  the methodology of the Jesuit order to to found the Illuminati but all I'm
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:08.240]  asking is exactly specifically does the book from the synopsis I've read and
[3:50:08.240 --> 3:50:12.040]  maybe I should read it I'm just so busy it says here's the Illuminati here's the
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:15.760]  Catholic Church the two are fighting is that the message they say that the
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:19.560]  Catholic Church doesn't like the Illuminati because they were coming from
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:22.920]  a different standpoint and they have people like the lay low and other
[3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:26.840]  scientists like that so that's basically why they say they're against each other
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:33.480]  and what a little exactly the Catholic Church is backwards and bad and you know
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:41.240]  wanted to go after Galileo so in a way the Illuminati's the good guys I mean I
[3:50:41.240 --> 3:50:45.000]  haven't read the book yet sir so I appreciate your call Wilson I can't
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:48.120]  really comment I've only read the synopsis but I'll find out more it's
[3:50:48.120 --> 3:50:51.560]  about to come out I just don't like watching movies like that but I'll try

[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:42.560]  guest the makers of the Eye of the Phoenix hi Alex it's Jeff I have been a
[3:55:42.560 --> 3:55:46.640]  longtime supporter of yours and I think you're having an excellent discussion
[3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:51.440]  today I know time is short so I'll get right to it your guests mentioned that
[3:55:51.440 --> 3:55:55.760]  the American dollar is meant to perish like the Phoenix and then rise up again
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:56:00.680]  in a new form and I just wanted to put this out there as an insight perhaps
[3:56:00.680 --> 3:56:05.600]  they're thinking that that one world currency will actually be in the form of
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:06.600]  carbon credits
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:11.120]  oh yeah as you you've mentioned we're moving to a cashless society and how
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:15.800]  better to regulate people than link everything to carbon credits and that
[3:56:15.800 --> 3:56:18.920]  goes into the guy a worship let's get a comment from our guest on that fine
[3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:26.600]  point it's possible I mean it's it's clearly possible and you know I think
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:30.000]  Obama it's going to be the man that's going to is going to
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:34.080]  shepherd America through that through that whole process well that's what
[3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:39.600]  Kissinger said he's going to bring in the new world order mr. Pinto you know I
[3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:42.600]  haven't studied the carbon credit thing enough to really comment on that
[3:56:42.600 --> 3:56:46.600]  specifically I'm still wondering if they're going to you know if they're
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:49.840]  going to if they're going to somehow or other initiate the North American Union
[3:56:49.840 --> 3:56:53.760]  and then bring in the Amaro or something similar yeah they're not in three blocks
[3:56:53.760 --> 3:56:57.520]  first great point thank you Jeff TJ and Nevada we just hung up I'm not going to
[3:56:57.520 --> 3:57:03.440]  anybody else then anything else Jeff okay thank you gentlemen I want to thank
[3:57:03.440 --> 3:57:06.760]  you both for coming on the show each of you a closing one-minute comment or a
[3:57:06.760 --> 3:57:14.080]  30-second comment go ahead David well this this I have the Phoenix documentary
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:19.680]  tells the story that in that the that the Masonic you know in
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:24.520]  Rosicrucian secret societies and and their modern-day descendants like
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:29.160]  skull and bones have originally from the time from before America was founded
[3:57:29.160 --> 3:57:36.360]  plan to to use America as the the as the powerful prosperous nation to lead the
[3:57:36.360 --> 3:57:40.680]  world the rest of the world into this global government economy and religion
[3:57:40.680 --> 3:57:45.960]  and then stage their masonic messiah and all that symbolism is found in the
[3:57:45.960 --> 3:57:50.320]  on the dollar bill and as we say in riddle showing rhythm stone the same
[3:57:50.320 --> 3:57:54.280]  story is in the street layouts and the paintings and sculptures of Washington
[3:57:54.280 --> 3:57:59.600]  the absolutely closing comments quickly Mr. Pinto well I think the fascinating
[3:57:59.600 --> 3:58:03.600]  part of this whole thing for me was how the great pyramids symbolizes
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:08.680]  Solomon's rebuilt temple in the city of Jerusalem and part of what we show at
[3:58:08.680 --> 3:58:13.560]  the end of the film is how you've got orthodox Jews and Freemasons working to
[3:58:13.560 --> 3:58:19.000]  rebuild the temple there in Jerusalem in fulfillment of their the appearance of
[3:58:19.000 --> 3:58:23.200]  their Christ figure that's right all the symbolism Chris Pinto David May will
[3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:26.080]  talk to you very soon from cutting-edge ministries thank you so much for
