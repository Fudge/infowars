[00:53.040 --> 01:01.440]  obviously our job gets harder and harder as the entire planet the entire media
[01:01.440 --> 01:08.440]  system struggles with the fact that world governments real they are growing
[01:08.440 --> 01:14.920]  genetically engineered humanoid clones in animals poison is putting our water
[01:14.920 --> 01:20.480]  and food by design there's a breakaway civilization under national security
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.640]  that's above the law and tax exempt and we don't even know what it's doing the
[01:25.640 --> 01:32.760]  small percentage we know is beyond science fiction our government is trying
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.880]  to start a war with Russia one of the last holdouts not being part of the
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.680]  world government our so-called government is funding radical jihadist
[01:42.680 --> 01:46.360]  Islamist all over the world and and turning them loose to murder Christians
[01:46.360 --> 01:54.600]  and non-radical Muslims I have so many videos today of Germans being raped and
[01:54.600 --> 02:02.520]  attacked at bus stations and in public pools that I can't even watch them
[02:02.520 --> 02:10.440]  myself there's too many much less even play them all and they've got a civil
[02:10.440 --> 02:16.160]  emergency banning people's free speech in Germany and France let's now become an
[02:16.160 --> 02:21.160]  economic emergency where they're taking people's money major banks are
[02:21.160 --> 02:25.680]  announcing a war on cash the B system is here that's the headline the B system
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.960]  arises largest bank in Norway calls elimination of cash joining all these
[02:29.960 --> 02:37.240]  other big banks and when I was out taking care of business this morning running
[02:37.240 --> 02:43.000]  into people all they would do even people that knew who I am would say boy how
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.040]  about those games last night that is the culture okay we'll cover it then Panthers
[02:49.040 --> 02:54.920]  open up four-point favorites in Vegas over Broncos okay associated press

[03:02.960 --> 03:07.280]  got some other red meat distractionary issues Clint Eastwood hey liberals most
[03:07.280 --> 03:13.480]  people don't win it's up on infowars.com there's a thousand people in the
[03:13.480 --> 03:21.920]  academy and only what 15 or so I guess they're gonna win and you know my
[03:21.920 --> 03:31.280]  question is why aren't there any white winners over at the BET Awards by the way
[03:31.280 --> 03:35.160]  I'm all for people to have black entertainment television I think you
[03:35.160 --> 03:38.040]  should be able to have Irish television if somebody wants to put it together and
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.960]  do it or Scottish or German or Chinese whatever but you do know under political
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.120]  correctness everybody can have their own ethnic channel but white people but
[03:47.120 --> 03:52.520]  separately from that you talk about Hollywood it is the most elitist insular
[03:52.520 --> 03:59.360]  group I've ever seen you know you got that Clippers owner remember who was you
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.800]  know telling his girlfriend hey don't date black people baby you can go out
[04:03.800 --> 04:09.080]  with whoever you want but don't be seen with black people you just don't do that
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.120]  and he's a Jewish guy an old Jewish guy and let me just give you a little news
[04:13.120 --> 04:17.680]  flash folks I know in the politically correct world there's this idea that only
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.640]  people that are racist or folks with wasp last names you get around some old
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.440]  Jews you get around some old black people you get around some old whatever you
[04:26.440 --> 04:31.000]  get around some old Mexicans you're gonna hear some races talk that's just
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.440]  the way it is but the point is I think there's a mix of both I mean I find it
[04:35.440 --> 04:38.440]  hard to believe that year after year there are no black Academy Award winners
[04:38.440 --> 04:44.120]  and so are they pushing all of this to create more racial division I don't
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.000]  know no it's a bunch of Academy people that give awards to their friends and
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.560]  the old Hollywood systems run by a bunch of old white people that's what's
[04:52.560 --> 04:55.240]  going on here
[04:58.640 --> 05:02.320]  Russia and Turkey are headed for a military confrontation along Syria's
[05:02.320 --> 05:06.600]  border with Turkey as reported by Kurt Nemo of info wars.com according to
[05:06.600 --> 05:10.680]  intelligence sources in the United States. Russia has dispatched engineers to
[05:10.680 --> 05:14.320]  the northeastern city of Qalmishi on the border. The Qalmishi International
[05:14.320 --> 05:17.800]  Airport has already been closed to civilian air traffic and turned over to
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.240]  the Syrian military in late October. Around 200 Russian personnel will fortify
[05:22.240 --> 05:26.080]  the airfield in Qalmishi and ready it for military aircraft according to the
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.280]  London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Turkish media also reported
[05:30.280 --> 05:34.320]  the presence of Russian engineers and around 30 miles away US military
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.920]  personnel have established a secret air base and are building another one at a
[05:37.920 --> 05:41.840]  former agricultural airfield a few miles from the Iraqi and Turkish borders
[05:41.840 --> 05:45.600]  according to Syrian activists. The Turkish government claims it's stepping up
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.520]  maneuvers against the Islamic State. Those previously reported that Turkey has
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.720]  been buying up stolen Syrian oil from ISIS for at least several months. This is

[08:05.480 --> 08:16.480]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:16.480 --> 08:25.440]  We are reaching a point globally where you either have to be in a full
[08:25.440 --> 08:30.240]  delusion to not know that we're going under scientific tyranny or you are
[08:30.240 --> 08:35.480]  waking up to the fact that indeed we are in the hands of some very very
[08:35.480 --> 08:43.000]  sophisticated wicked ruthless people who are very very close to either dominating
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.440]  humanity or losing control. The contest is within a razor's edge. We stand balanced
[08:50.440 --> 08:58.280]  on the knife's edge and everything you do and everything I do, everything we talk
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.960]  about, every decision we make, every statement we make, every email we send
[09:03.960 --> 09:08.120]  affects the future of this globe.
[09:08.120 --> 09:19.480]  Look at DrudgeReport.com. Boils it all down perfectly. The big news what's
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.120]  really important. There it is right there. Border battle. Passengers allowed to
[09:25.120 --> 09:30.720]  skip customs at JFK Airport again.
[09:30.720 --> 09:41.720]  If you understand that story from the New York Daily News you understand everything.
[09:41.720 --> 09:47.720]  Remember there are stories every day that are like skeleton keys to unlock every door
[09:47.720 --> 09:53.720]  that illustrate everything we're talking about. Ladies and gentlemen in fact I want
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.720]  to pull the article up and I want to rerun it or have Kit Daniels or Adon Salazar
[09:57.720 --> 10:03.720]  rerun the Jakari Jackson interview with the emergency manager a year and a half
[10:03.720 --> 10:13.720]  ago in McAllen, Texas on the Mexican border and we're sent down there by an
[10:13.720 --> 10:19.720]  ice tip. We interview the ice agent in their car. They tell us where to go and
[10:19.720 --> 10:25.720]  there are the hundreds of buses a day, every hour more than ten of them.
[10:25.720 --> 10:31.720]  Coming in at all hours of the day offloading men women and children who are
[10:31.720 --> 10:36.720]  then given vouchers to be loaded on other buses. They are being trans shipped out
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.720]  of Mexico up to the border and put in other private buses and dispersed. That
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.720]  was treason sedition. It's federal law you can't do that and when a citizen flies
[10:48.720 --> 10:55.720]  in you get the third degree. You get interrogated. I flew in from Cancun last
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.720]  year the woman knew who I was ordered me pulled out on a power trip taken to the
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.720]  back and then the manager came in and said hey I'm a listener there's no
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.720]  reason we know you're not smuggling stuff you can go I'm sorry about this.
[11:12.720 --> 11:15.720]  They took me back there for 20 minutes in the back and we're getting ready to
[11:15.720 --> 11:21.720]  the whole nine yards folks. And that's another microcosm of the government
[11:21.720 --> 11:26.720]  and corporations and things. One person's out to get you the other person is out
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.720]  to uphold the Constitution Bill of Rights. There's a civil war inside the
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.720]  government and that's another microcosm but border battle. Ladies and gentlemen
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.720]  we told you two years ago that's when the Border Patrol called us and they
[11:41.720 --> 11:46.720]  said listen they're flying planes in from all over the world and customs is told
[11:46.720 --> 11:50.720]  to stand down get your reporters over here and cover it. I said have you told
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.720]  the other media yeah we told other people they're not responding. Now get down
[11:55.720 --> 12:06.720]  here to McCallum. Now that was two years ago. The reason this is such a big deal
[12:06.720 --> 12:12.720]  is that if the media catches on and if we can force this out with the full
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.720]  narrative of what's going on it's not one plane it's not two planes it's not
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.720]  five planes it's not 20 planes it's hundreds that we know of and they
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.720]  advertise in Chinese newspapers if you're pregnant wait till you're two weeks
[12:27.720 --> 12:34.720]  out fly here on a tourist visa walk in when your water breaks everything's
[12:34.720 --> 12:44.720]  ready for 10,000 Chinese women a week Chinese women are now more than
[12:44.720 --> 12:55.720]  Mexicans coming into the country folks that's what a joke we are and again
[12:55.720 --> 13:05.720]  the lawlessness of the government that in front of all of us they surveil us
[13:05.720 --> 13:12.720]  they watch us they control us and 15 years after 9-11 we're less safe than
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.720]  we were losing all of our freedoms and that's the amazing scene on the X
[13:18.720 --> 13:24.720]  files last night the new premiere I was dumbfounded by how sophisticated it was
[13:24.720 --> 13:32.720]  and I'm gonna do a review later when Mueller's talking to his old FBI buddy
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.720]  and they're down there in the X files room and everything's been emptied out
[13:36.720 --> 13:44.720]  and he looks at him he says they took all of our freedoms in the last 15 years
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.720]  and now we're less safe than we ever were no matter what's really going on here
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.720]  no matter who was really behind 9-11 they use it to take our freedoms period done
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.720]  and they can lawlessly selectively enforce however they want
[14:03.720 --> 14:08.720]  two years ago Obamacare started getting phased in 2,000 waivers to major
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.720]  corporations unions democratic party groups McDonald's you don't have to have
[14:14.720 --> 14:18.720]  Obamacare you don't have to pay for it but the hamburger place owned by a mom and
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.720]  pop next door does just like they can fly people in and just not even look at
[14:23.720 --> 14:27.720]  their IDs not even look at what they're doing under orders and no one will say
[14:27.720 --> 14:30.720]  where the orders come from just like the orders of the border patrol to quote
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.720]  complete the smuggling process and the border patrol went on Fox News a month
[14:35.720 --> 14:42.720]  after we broke that and Megan Kelly said we've been told and we've heard that
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.720]  you actually ship them in and they're like yes we're not allowed to tell you
[14:46.720 --> 14:50.720]  exactly what we do but we are ordered to complete the smuggling process the
[14:50.720 --> 14:59.720]  government smuggles the illegals in they're bringing radical Muslim refugees in
[14:59.720 --> 15:05.720]  from all over the world secretly to US air bases and you can look it up it'll be
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.720]  rumors are and then well the news station went out to San Francisco airport and
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.720]  there indeed were the people being brought to the Air Force base but the
[15:12.720 --> 15:20.720]  rumors are secret they claim that 50 something refugees got brought to Texas
[15:20.720 --> 15:28.720]  in the last months of 2015 folks my alma mater had 320 something in one month
[15:28.720 --> 15:36.720]  brought in last year Anderson high we called LBJ Austin high and stopped after
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.720]  a few and they all would tell us oh yes we have a hundred we have 200 we have
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.720]  no one help I mean every high school in Austin is jam packed you go downtown
[15:46.720 --> 15:51.720]  Austin folks it looks like many times like you are in Pakistan or something
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.720]  or Saudi Arabia and Riyadh I mean there are people with their faces covered
[15:55.720 --> 16:02.720]  completely all over the place and the point is it's just boom it's here
[16:02.720 --> 16:06.720]  and listen that's just part of it what else is going on beneath the surface
[16:06.720 --> 16:14.640]  happening that we don't know about. But Jakari Jackson and my reporters, in fact, I'm gonna
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.720]  send them all back down to McCall and everywhere else to show that and back to our sources
[16:17.720 --> 16:22.520]  and bigs and all of them just all over the border because and up to JFK and everywhere
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.360]  else because there it is flashback board patrol caught red-handed paying the ship illegals
[16:28.360 --> 16:32.560]  deep into the US exclusive federal government works to keep illegals inside the US while
[16:32.560 --> 16:39.320]  passing the cost on the taxpayers and we have the video we need a new article about breaking
[16:39.320 --> 16:46.320]  federal government caught busing in and flying in illegals and then just show our report
[16:46.320 --> 16:52.580]  from a year and a half ago and show the new reports and just show people it's the lawlessness
[16:52.580 --> 17:00.800]  of the system they do whatever they want and it's not to protect you the TSA on trains
[17:00.800 --> 17:06.200]  the TSA in downtown Austin where I live you know the the TSA in Dallas where I was born
[17:06.200 --> 17:15.800]  the TSA all over the country randomly coming up and searching you but the borders open
[17:15.800 --> 17:20.560]  it's like putting big red flashing signs on your house saying come on in rob us leaving
[17:20.560 --> 17:26.280]  the front doors open and then going and standing with a sword over your children as if they're
[17:26.280 --> 17:32.960]  criminals you've got to watch them America is treated like captured slaves because we
[17:32.960 --> 17:38.240]  are they want our bank accounts our pensions they they've already stolen all the money
[17:38.240 --> 17:41.640]  they've got to have this police state because you're going to try to take the government
[17:41.640 --> 17:45.440]  back and have the states take the government back and reconstitute America and the people
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.040]  that hijacked the country aren't going to let you and they're going to bring in tens
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.440]  of millions of people from China and the Middle East and Eastern Europe and Africa and Latin
[17:53.440 --> 17:58.120]  America all like a tower of Babel where none of us can communicate only the government
[17:58.120 --> 18:04.720]  can manage everybody off against each other and we sit there and we see it happening
[18:04.720 --> 18:09.440]  and Donald Trump dares to come out and talk about it and so he's a criminal he's a demon
[18:09.440 --> 18:26.040]  he's a Nazi he's a this he's a that seven days left to Iowa think about all the things
[18:26.040 --> 18:32.520]  that are happening right now and just think about what's coming next under this system
[18:32.520 --> 18:39.680]  now here's the other big jumbo story maybe people will listen now because Ron Paul said
[18:39.680 --> 18:45.600]  it which is good he is respected took a week for folks when I got the secret my act report
[18:45.600 --> 18:50.000]  Homeland Security reports saying veterans gun owners returning veterans Christians conservatives
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.040]  are the number one enemy of the Homeland Security in the coming civil wars coming with us and
[18:54.040 --> 19:01.160]  you know go ahead and arrest people or they've got Ron Paul stickers and info wars that blew
[19:01.160 --> 19:07.360]  up in their face and actually woke the police up but it took a week or about six days for
[19:07.360 --> 19:11.400]  Ron Paul to come out and say yeah no that's a real report I called Homeland Security that's
[19:11.400 --> 19:17.880]  real what people just think I got that report and just came out and made it up and now of
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.760]  course that's household known knowledge that's just hidden in plain view but I came out Friday
[19:24.760 --> 19:29.880]  and we went over the defense one article where they are trying to pass legislation to grant
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.760]  the president unlimited military power anywhere in the world in perpetuity anytime with boots
[19:34.760 --> 19:40.360]  on the ground unprecedented it is military martial law powers it's it's it's giving
[19:40.360 --> 19:44.640]  the president those unconstitutional powers and Congress signing over its authority doesn't
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.240]  mean it's being executed but they are putting it in and Ron Paul has come out now the article
[19:49.240 --> 19:53.880]  in info wars.com he went and looked at it former Congressman Congress is writing the
[19:53.880 --> 20:00.120]  president a blank check for war says it's the greatest power grab ever something just happened
[20:00.120 --> 20:04.600]  that is explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in

[25:16.440 --> 25:18.600]  there are many here among us
[25:20.600 --> 25:23.880]  who do the life is but a joke that is poetry
[25:23.880 --> 25:31.080]  but you and i we've been through that this is not our fate and this is not our fate
[25:31.960 --> 25:36.040]  all along the watchtower so let us stop talking falsely now
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.520]  but i was getting late i think that says it all about the state of the world right now
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.040]  and four riders were approaching the wind began to how
[25:48.040 --> 25:58.120]  and then you sit there as a man you see the maid not aware of what's going on their foot
[25:58.120 --> 26:04.040]  servants too not awake not alive not watchmen on the tower
[26:08.200 --> 26:09.320]  but this is not our fate
[26:12.840 --> 26:15.720]  that's probably one of the most beautiful songs ever what an artist would have sold
[26:15.720 --> 26:17.720]  listen to that guitar
[26:21.160 --> 26:29.000]  that is a creature made by god that is an example of human beauty that is why the enemy hates us
[26:32.840 --> 26:35.720]  play that guitar better than the devil himself in heaven
[26:35.720 --> 26:45.000]  because humans are made better than the fallen that's why the devil hates us
[26:46.360 --> 26:48.040]  all along the watchtower
[26:48.040 --> 26:54.280]  all along the watchtower persons can't love you
[26:56.680 --> 27:01.480]  while all the women came in with their foot servants too
[27:04.840 --> 27:11.400]  well outside in the cold distance a wildcat did grow
[27:13.560 --> 27:15.400]  two riders were approaching
[27:15.400 --> 27:22.280]  all right i don't normally play most of the song but i thought today that it's certainly fit
[27:22.280 --> 27:26.680]  for what we face this is a short segment we do obviously have a long segment coming up
[27:28.360 --> 27:31.960]  where to go with everything that's happening i mean it's it's all just part of the ongoing
[27:31.960 --> 27:39.800]  progression and if info wars and if ron paul and if others are able to force this story out
[27:39.800 --> 27:46.360]  you will then see thousands of articles saying jones is insane obama isn't going to put troops
[27:46.360 --> 27:51.320]  on the streets of america and have martial law under the new authorization of force
[27:52.520 --> 28:00.360]  and that's not what we said we said it is martial law on paper never before done
[28:00.360 --> 28:05.400]  given to the president so they're just getting all these executive orders and all these laws
[28:05.400 --> 28:12.360]  in place for what what are they planning what's coming is it war with russia is it global
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.760]  financial collapse i think we already see war with russia through ukraine and syria proxy war
[28:18.440 --> 28:25.640]  we already see economic warfare with the oil prices we already are in the beginning of world war
[28:25.640 --> 28:34.840]  four it's economic it's paramilitary it's asymmetrical what comes next i know it's not
[28:34.840 --> 28:38.920]  going to be the panthers and the broncos i mean is that really what's important
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.720]  is that in the final equation what we're really looking at
[28:52.840 --> 28:56.680]  let's start going over this though and then i'll get into the other news congress is writing the
[28:56.680 --> 29:02.920]  president of the blank check for war ron paul the legislation makes the unconstitutional iraq war
[29:02.920 --> 29:13.000]  authorization of 2002 looked like a walk in the park 360 omnipresent total warfare suspension of
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.480]  all laws under war powers act under civil emergency is basically what it is troops in america troops
[29:19.480 --> 29:25.560]  against russia anything they want the furor says we do this we do it and it goes on to the next
[29:25.560 --> 29:32.120]  president think about that we come back we're going to look more at this we're going to get
[29:32.120 --> 29:39.400]  into the unbelievable islamic fascist rape orgies going on all over europe the beast system
[29:39.400 --> 29:45.160]  rising jfk wide open foreigners not having their passports check nothing being looked at it's all
[29:45.160 --> 29:51.160]  coming up and yes they are now reporting we're on the march in mainstream news about the hybrid
[29:51.160 --> 29:54.760]  tortured monkeys alex jones and apes that's that's in mainstream news
[29:54.760 --> 30:02.840]  hundreds of monkeys have been sent to australia for so-called medical experiments that raise
[30:02.840 --> 30:07.400]  serious ethical concerns and potentially reveal what would happen if human oids are grown in a
[30:07.400 --> 30:13.080]  lab more than 370 primates have been part of the research over the past 15 years and the scientists
[30:13.080 --> 30:17.880]  who conduct the tests are most likely entirely lacking in expertise essential to care for such
[30:17.880 --> 30:22.280]  animals australia's royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said the
[30:22.280 --> 30:26.200]  experiments are extremely cruel in nature with one test reportedly involving a baboon who died
[30:26.200 --> 30:30.600]  after getting a kidney transplant from a pig the violent experiments were mainly conducted at the
[30:30.600 --> 30:35.320]  national health and medical research council baboon colony in western sydney millions of dollars
[30:35.320 --> 30:39.560]  from research grants were used to conduct the experiments in hospitals conducted with studies
[30:39.560 --> 30:43.560]  refused to disclose the details about the number of primates which have been experimented on or
[30:43.560 --> 30:47.960]  how many had died or had been killed now hypothetically if these same scientists were to grow
[30:47.960 --> 30:53.000]  human oids in a lab by combining human dna with who knows what else do you really think they would
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.400]  treat them any different now think about that and this is kit the annuals reporting for info wars

[35:29.560 --> 35:33.880]  and start trying to censor people we're under martial law when they start establishing civilian
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.840]  inmate labor camp programs and internment facilities at army dot mill and admitting that
[35:38.840 --> 35:47.640]  they're quote preparing for civil unrest and quote reeducation centers they use the totalitarian
[35:47.640 --> 35:54.520]  soviet term on purpose in the manual no less than more than 15 times look it up and how they're
[35:54.520 --> 35:58.840]  going to process your social security numbers how they're going to put different men in one area

[36:31.720 --> 36:40.120]  camps and eliminate 25 to 50 million people and they're sitting around and by the way i've been
[36:40.120 --> 36:45.480]  around communist i've been around famous socialist and people i've interviewed and you notice you
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.800]  never heard them or saw them on the show again because they uncloak and go you better join the
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.640]  communists we're going to kill everybody when we take over there's going to be blood everywhere
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.560]  and you're just like whoa and then it happens a couple times you're like uh and then it happens
[36:59.560 --> 37:04.600]  four or five six times over the years you're like oh my gosh and then on the street i've had famous

[37:09.800 --> 37:15.640]  just lean over and go when we take over you're dead and you look at her like who is that and you
[37:15.640 --> 37:20.600]  look it up at some famous political scientist professor the head of the university section
[37:22.040 --> 37:25.720]  we've got some of it on tape my film marshal law there's all these communist professors out there
[37:25.720 --> 37:30.760]  and i'm like hey you know stallion killed 30 40 million people and the guy goes good we're gonna
[37:30.760 --> 37:40.120]  kill you too and then we were walking off and they ran down and went we're gonna kill you and i've
[37:40.120 --> 37:45.320]  had them the quote local anarchist many times who claim they're anarchist because the public's so
[37:45.320 --> 37:52.040]  politically ignorant and then as soon as the cameras are off they'll walk over and go we do
[37:52.040 --> 38:01.400]  work for the state and when our system comes in you and your family are dead
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.720]  they get off on thinking about all this and thank god for george washington and thomas jefferson
[38:10.760 --> 38:16.040]  from their grave they're holding up the republic from their grave they put in place the emergency
[38:16.040 --> 38:27.160]  backups the warnings the guns the preparation the ghost of george washington like mighty atlas
[38:27.160 --> 38:36.120]  holds the republic on his shoulders i salute george washington we must remember where we came
[38:36.120 --> 38:41.320]  from we must reach back to our spiritual roots that have an electrical connection from this day to
[38:41.320 --> 38:50.680]  that through our blood through our sweat through our toil through our history not perfect men but
[38:50.680 --> 38:55.080]  attacked continually because they were so great because they were so good because they were true
[38:55.080 --> 39:02.280]  intellectual warriors because they were given kingship and turned it down and that's why king
[39:02.280 --> 39:12.200]  george the third said today george washington is the greatest man alive in the world no one but
[39:12.200 --> 39:25.480]  jesus christ ever turned down being king some would make him king others wouldn't stand for that
[39:25.480 --> 39:35.480]  they believed in humanity they believed in the potential they were fans of their fellow humans
[39:36.200 --> 39:42.520]  not enslavers and of course the answer would be but they had slaves and there were slaves all over
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.160]  the world at that time and the first declaration of independence was written to get rid of slavery
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.560]  but there would have been a civil war with the southern colonies again so they couldn't do it
[39:51.560 --> 39:59.000]  it doesn't matter it's the time they were in saudi arabia didn't abolish slavery till what 1963
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.560]  you never hear about that they don't take one refugee but lecture us all day because we have
[40:05.560 --> 40:13.240]  the christian ethic and we have guilt and we have a conscience and they manipulate our conscience
[40:14.360 --> 40:16.280]  because they know the west is noble
[40:16.280 --> 40:23.480]  every culture is noble but the west is noble
[40:25.800 --> 40:32.920]  and there's no room for nobility and honor in this tyranny it's an anti-human tyranny
[40:32.920 --> 40:50.040]  so it hates honor first and foremost it hates fidelity it hates family it hates good institutions
[40:50.040 --> 41:04.440]  it seeks to rule all to the very genetic building blocks of life to become a god the devil must
[41:04.440 --> 41:16.600]  overthrow creation in his mind a failed commitment that he already knows he's lost
[41:16.600 --> 41:24.840]  so he wishes to take god's creations with him is it martial law jfk allowed passengers arriving
[41:24.840 --> 41:31.880]  international flight to exit without going through customs again airline and security
[41:31.880 --> 41:36.680]  officials let travelers on american airlines flight one two two three from cancun mexico
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.720]  out of the airport without having their passports our bags checked wonder what goodies were being
[41:41.720 --> 41:47.240]  carried in passengers arriving at kennedy airport on the international flight were allowed to exit
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.040]  the busy hub without going through customs for at least the second time in recent months the daily
[41:52.040 --> 42:02.680]  news is learned oh it's bumbling so now they'll need more funding no it's not bumbling
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.160]  let's play the jacari jackson clip from last year we'll put the article on screen to give
[42:09.160 --> 42:14.040]  folks the data they want to see it again this should have been international news drudge
[42:14.040 --> 42:21.160]  linked to it it got some coverage but you know use it bumbling that they ship the illegals in
[42:21.720 --> 42:27.800]  in mcallum and every other border town border patrol caught red-handed paying to ship illegals
[42:27.800 --> 42:37.160]  deep into us january 25th 2016 they must have uh reposted it today there must be a
[42:37.160 --> 42:45.880]  a that's a flashback they they didn't repost a good job good and let's go to that clip us
[42:45.880 --> 42:53.160]  border patrol paying to ship illegals deep into us from june 18 2014 what happened to today in
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.280]  particular is that the border patrol dropped off some they call them detainees but obviously
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.240]  they're not detained after they dropped them off and normally they have tickets for a range
[43:03.240 --> 43:09.240]  transportation to go somewhere in the interior well today apparently for some logistical reasons
[43:09.240 --> 43:14.760]  some of them didn't hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow right
[43:14.760 --> 43:21.400]  and so we're having to find places to shelter for tonight so we've accessed some resources that we
[43:21.400 --> 43:25.320]  have we're going to shelter them here tonight so why is the border patrol bringing them here
[43:26.040 --> 43:30.360]  they're not bringing them here they're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's where
[43:30.360 --> 43:35.560]  the border patrol understands that they have transportation to go to the interior right so
[43:35.560 --> 43:39.560]  they're dropping them off it's our understanding that they were dropped off with tickets or with
[43:39.560 --> 43:45.560]  vouchers for tickets um turns out some of them didn't tonight didn't have their ticket or didn't
[43:45.560 --> 43:51.480]  have their voucher or like i said their buses until tomorrow so they got nowhere to stay our bus
[43:51.480 --> 43:57.560]  terminal buyers i mean the city of mccallan bus terminal is not a 24-7 operation right so we've
[43:57.560 --> 44:02.760]  got all right somewhere there you go and of course they got a bunch of other instances of that in
[44:02.760 --> 44:07.320]  other towns documented as well and we were directed there by the board patrol to see this for ourselves
[44:09.800 --> 44:13.560]  now you have to understand they're the emergency manager calmly talking about
[44:14.200 --> 44:16.920]  how outside of federal law they're just bringing people in
[44:19.080 --> 44:23.240]  now you can say what you want about these human beings god love them the point is
[44:23.240 --> 44:29.880]  is the whole security theater needs to end that's being put against us citizens of every race color
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.840]  and creed because it's all a fraud to train us how to be slaves let me just say that to the left
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.880]  okay bring in 50 million illegals 100 million get them everything free let's go bankrupt okay great
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.400]  we're loving we're liberal bernie sanders save us separately though can i not get groped or my
[44:45.400 --> 44:51.240]  children not get groped can i get left alone then too can i just come through without ids can i just
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.560]  get people off my back too how's that sound no because i'm gonna be discriminated against because
[44:55.560 --> 45:02.680]  i'm the big fat milk cow that has to sit here and pay for everything but all these big fortune 100
[45:02.680 --> 45:08.120]  companies they get exempted from the taxes exempted from the regulations exempted from the carbon
[45:08.120 --> 45:14.200]  tax exempted here exempted there they're the new royalty and that's why they distract us with oh
[45:14.200 --> 45:20.040]  having a mother and father hurts someone's feelings can't use that term in school oh brown paper bags
[45:20.040 --> 45:25.880]  oh somebody was a cowboy at the halloween party oh my gosh uh you know there's no black actors at
[45:25.880 --> 45:34.680]  the oscars oh my gosh oh let's all fight with each other all day because we're all having our
[45:34.680 --> 45:40.360]  freedoms taken we're all being put into massive global debt we're all having deadly vaccines
[45:40.360 --> 45:50.360]  pushed on us we're all being shoved gmo that kills the rodents that eat it i'm gonna say that again
[45:50.360 --> 45:57.160]  many of the rodents many of the other mammals the monkeys the guinea pigs the chalulas the the chinchillas
[46:01.800 --> 46:08.280]  die at high rates in first generation eating it early the next generation massive infertility
[46:08.280 --> 46:15.000]  massive deformities massive iq reductions and by the third generation every major mammal being fed
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.800]  bt corn other stuff that there's almost total infertility and they look like something out
[46:19.800 --> 46:28.200]  of a frankenstein movie rats have a multi-year life cycle but they don't live that long humans
[46:28.200 --> 46:34.280]  of course have about a 75 year cycle we're already one cycle into this you can already see the cancer
[46:34.280 --> 46:41.800]  of the death the mutations the problems all of it can you imagine phase two it's already started
[46:41.800 --> 46:46.440]  every tv show i watch is ads to raise money for kids that have cancer they're all over the place
[46:46.440 --> 46:50.520]  i can hardly go to the mall or out i see their shaved heads i see the little bump under their
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.480]  shirt where they've got the ports in them for the chemotherapy every bit of money that family's
[46:55.480 --> 47:01.240]  gots being pumped into the system and they put those they put that cancer virus in them i mean
[47:01.240 --> 47:06.440]  you know 50 years ago they would fly across the countries i've had medical doctors on to see a
[47:06.440 --> 47:14.200]  kid with cancer it was so rare 50 years ago in the 1960s it was unheard of
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.280]  and if there were cancers they knew there was radiation or toxic waste in the area
[47:20.280 --> 47:26.040]  and they moved everybody out now it's just hey don't worry everybody gets cancer now
[47:26.040 --> 47:32.840]  but let's make fun alex jones warn everybody let's just make a big joke out of it okay because
[47:32.840 --> 47:39.320]  it's so much easier to have let's not exaggerate 250 something according to google articles
[47:39.320 --> 47:46.680]  almost every one of them today attacking yours truly and saying oh the new x files is so horrible
[47:46.680 --> 47:52.920]  oh the new x files is so disgusting oh my gosh the whole world's alex jones now oh it's so kooky
[47:52.920 --> 47:58.440]  the london guardian how dare you people take alex too seriously and he's dangerous and chris carter
[47:58.440 --> 48:07.000]  needs to stop glorifying alex jones this is dangerous now i tell what's dangerous is pediatric
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.080]  cancer is up over 10 000 on average from 1960s look it up i think that's what's dangerous
[48:14.360 --> 48:17.400]  autism from one in 30 something thousand to one in 58
[48:17.400 --> 48:26.680]  crohn's disease didn't exist 50 years ago now i probably know 20 people that have got it
[48:28.760 --> 48:31.320]  directly from the vaccines on record
[48:33.960 --> 48:39.160]  you got a government that ran thousands of secret experiments on native americans blacks
[48:39.160 --> 48:45.080]  appellation whites us troops you name it and we're going to sit here and trust them with big pharma
[48:45.080 --> 48:52.120]  to put stuff in our bodies really anybody buy into that when you have bayer and all these other big

[49:15.000 --> 49:22.040]  big companies with the clintons went specifically to the arkansas prisons to get their blood
[49:22.040 --> 49:29.800]  knowing they had hiv and hepatitis and took it on purpose you talk about satanist you talk about
[49:29.800 --> 49:42.120]  devil worshipers that's who they are they're hardcore your wife has a car wreck she gets that

[50:12.920 --> 50:20.840]  in the media but here's the thing it's a badge of honor to be crucified politically
[50:23.880 --> 50:30.520]  i mean there's no thinking about it there's no debating it to say no to this
[50:30.520 --> 50:42.040]  hell opens up and asks us to crawl in with it oh it's dressed up in a pretty red dress

[56:28.880 --> 56:37.880]  and look i don't even watch discovery channel shows i'm on history channel shows i'm on nothing against them i just don't like watching myself on tv
[56:37.880 --> 56:49.880]  i've been in quite a few movies where i've been cameos i don't watch the movies and i've watched waking life standard arcley stuff like that but some of the others i just i just don't like watching myself this is not an exercise in narcissism is what i'm saying
[56:49.880 --> 57:03.880]  but it is an exercise in trying to be a leader to motivate people to take action and the fact that the new x-files is predominantly based on info wars material and alex jones then the media throws in blend back on the end of it it's not based on blend back
[57:03.880 --> 57:11.880]  yeah you know i mean obviously 911 truth stuff like that and that's what carter has basically fleshed out and said
[57:11.880 --> 57:17.880]  so this is a big victory though that the new x-files you find out
[57:17.880 --> 57:24.880]  spoiler alert it isn't aliens it's the government basically posing with advanced civilization breakaway technology
[57:24.880 --> 57:30.880]  ai computers and chimera creatures are alien folks they're just made here

[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.880]  of the

[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880]  present contest
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.880]  which of course is the make fun of hillary contest
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:56.880]  that's a good idea for contests is to promote her being sent to prison the best stunt it's 10,000 okay i'm already thinking of a new contest that's what happens
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.880]  we're gonna announce the details of that how much they're winning who they are
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.880]  i know i kind of picked the winners last week but then i never really wrote it down or put it together
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880]  so if i can be given that it'll be awesome
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:13.880]  finalists make fun of hillary contest here are the finalists of the contest again those three videos were posted on friday
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:21.880]  i'll tell you who won first second third place coming up here in just a little while
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.880]  now
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.880]  that said we're also going to be getting into the beast system arises
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.880]  the largest bank in norway calls for the elimination of cash
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.880]  many local banks branches in norway already don't deal in cash
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.880]  but that is not good enough
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.880]  the biggest bank in norway and this is again a bunch of other big mega banks are calling for this
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.880]  it's calling for the complete and total end of cash
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.880]  many local bank branches in norway already don't deal in cash
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.880]  this is not good enough for dnb they want a blanket ban on the use of cash and they are selling this
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.880]  as a way to crack down on criminals and money launders when the big banks and their pull have been caught running with drugs
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.880]  but in the end the truth is they want to be able to force everyone in society to use banks
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.880]  and it would enable them to collect fees on almost every transaction
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:13.880]  it is an agenda that is being driven by greed but it could also open the door for great tyranny
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.880]  absolutely you're not a good globalist they just turn off your digital money
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.880]  or you transfer your social security check and they say that means you're inept and are declared incompetent
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.880]  and they take your guns already being announced
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.880]  unfortunately we are not just seeing aggressive movement towards a casual society in norway
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.880]  it's also happening in sweden and denmark and in many other nations around the globe
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:37.880]  yes some of those northern european countries are so socialist they take your taxes right out of your bank
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.880]  and then track everything you do
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.880]  the beast system is rising and yet very few people out there even seem alarmed by this
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.880]  then it goes over the international business times report and more on that front
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.880]  the largest bank in norway has called for the country to stop using cash
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.880]  the local reported friday this comes at the last move in the country that has been leading to global
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:07.880]  charge towards electronic money in the recent years with several banks already not offering cash in their branch offices
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.880]  and some industries seeking to cut out cash and paper currency
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.880]  of course it's all being sold to something that will be good for norwegian society
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.880]  and then it goes on from there
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.880]  the big mega banks are the top of the pyramid
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.880]  they control the planet
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.880]  they give themselves unlimited currency
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.880]  they get to violate any laws they want
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.880]  just like obama does where they just let people in on these flights
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.880]  we had board patrols i said two years ago tell us
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.880]  look at these airports there's flights coming in every day
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.880]  no one checks who they are
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.880]  it's been preplanned in the countries of origin
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.880]  it's incredible look into it and then we looked into it and then finally it showed up a few newspapers
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.880]  but it's still going on no one seems to care and they just act like they're dumb and it's an accident
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.880]  no no it's by design we just showed the video earlier
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.880]  of the emergency manager admitting he's been ordered to do this by the government
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.880]  outside of law
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.880]  and again that just shows the complete total lawlessness
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.880]  they do whatever they want
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.880]  it has nothing to do with security
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880]  it has everything to do with a
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:23.880]  financial, paramilitary, cultural, biological, spiritual overwrite
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:30.880]  an absolute total and complete top-down takeover
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.880]  with every piece of matter on the earth
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.880]  you can practice in real time by supercomputers predicting the future
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.880]  and then manipulating future outcomes with incredible precision
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.880]  but only if they can feed you propaganda and have you act and respond to stimuli
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880]  the way they want you like a robot
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.880]  that's how they can control you
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.880]  if you start doing erratic things there's nothing they can do to stop you
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.880]  stay with us

[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:33.880]  oh we've gone over the edge into the technocracy into 2016
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.880]  into the world government into planetary taxation
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.880]  JFK allowed passengers arriving on international flight to exit
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.880]  without going through customs again
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.880]  oh it's an accident no we played video of people at the border saying
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.880]  we've been ordered to let the illegals through
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.880]  with Jacarie Jackson documenting that
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.880]  now Pastor Manning of Otla World Church in Harlem
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.880]  with the intel on what the Reverend Sharpton and others are up to
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  with Black Lives Matter trying to start a race war in the country
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.880]  getting into the election getting into what's happening with abortion
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.880]  getting into the radical Islamic invasion of Europe
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.880]  we're going to be going over all of that with him about 15 minutes
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.880]  of the next hour with the pastor here today
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.880]  but as promised let me go ahead and announce the winners
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.880]  and then after he leaves us next hour I will play the winners
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.880]  of the Make Fun of Hillary contest that was very successful
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.880]  hundreds of great entries everybody that got involved was a winner
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.880]  she had our people calling up the Laugh Factory and other places threatening
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880]  to shut them down
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.880]  the official campaign is saying you don't make fun of Hillary
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.880]  I mean the fact that that's so mafia that's so un-American
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.880]  that's so incredibly dangerous that it makes my head spin
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.880]  and so we countered it and said we will make fun of you
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.880]  you notice when Richard Reeves talked to her
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.880]  just last week about her email being hacked
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.880]  when they heard info wars her managers her people it was like
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.880]  they had seen a ghost they got so freaked out adrenaline they jumped to her side
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.880]  the unnameable info wars it's so horrible
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.880]  the name of the New York Times dare not say
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.880]  you are bankrupt New York Times because you do omit stuff
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.880]  we don't need you to recognize us
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.880]  info wars reaches 28 million people a week conservatively now
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.880]  the new X files is on record modeled off quote my research
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.880]  and there's a character based on me
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.880]  and yet I'm not bragging about that it just shows culturally
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.880]  the type of push we could have to be dominating the script
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.880]  of what is arguably the biggest TV show in world history worldwide
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.880]  Dallas Seinfeld X files
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.880]  that's cultural victory ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.880]  and to have Chris Carter come out in a bunch of newspapers and say
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.880]  Alex Jones in right wing he's a libertarian patriot
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.880]  and I agree there is a world government being formed
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.880]  and then Chris Carter tells me oh yeah I want to meet with you
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.880]  I admire you I'm not bragging folks
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.880]  Chris Carter is one of the most famous TV producers ever
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.880]  and he was also an investigative journalist before that
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.880]  so here's what I'm saying we're having a big effect
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.880]  and the people that got involved in this contest
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.880]  you're having a big effect
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.880]  the action of what you do you may never know who you touched
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.880]  or what you did you probably won't
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.880]  but later you'll see those ripples come back in the culture and society
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880]  believe me I didn't know when I started out 21 years ago on Access TV
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.880]  that Vladimir Putin would be a weekly viewer and listener
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.880]  I didn't know that former CIA directors were listeners
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.880]  I didn't know that I was reaching Matt Drudge or any of these people
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.880]  and now you see the fruit of that hard labor you can do that too
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.880]  and the more of us stand up the less these bullies can intimidate everybody
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.880]  that's the answer
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.880]  I don't want to be the big enchilada I don't want to be the big leader in all this
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.880]  I want America and the world to wake up and all of us work together to change the world
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880]  I want to promote people like Pastor Manning
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.880]  and world net daily and countless others that are out there telling the truth
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.880]  because then they can't take us all out
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.880]  we are not in competition folks we are brothers in arms together
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.880]  and that's what this is all about
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.880]  number one first place winner Hillary
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.880]  a joke that ain't funny
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.880]  it's powerful, it's the winner
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.880]  and what were the prizes on this?
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.880]  $1,000 for second place
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.880]  $5,000 for first place
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.880]  and then you get a bunch of swag and goodies and t-shirts and stuff for third place
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.880]  but Al Parker in this short film
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.880]  Al Parker reminds infowars.com
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.880]  that while there are plenty of ways to make fun of Hillary
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.880]  she really shouldn't be laughed at
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.880]  she is a tragedy in the making and must be regarded with seriousness
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.880]  like the plague absolutely
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:04.880]  number two Adam Green Hillary Clinton supporter destroys infowars.com contest
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  performs a frighteningly accurate impression of a typical Hillary supporter
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:15.880]  and then Mr. Blair with Queen Hillary
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.880]  we're going to break that down coming up that's a hip hop song
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.880]  so there are the winners congratulations on being involved in the animating contest for Liberty
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.880]  congratulations everybody else that was involved as well
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.880]  now we're going to go to our guest here in about two minutes
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880]  but I'll review this more in the third hour
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.880]  and then Jakari Jackson is coming in with Leanne Mack and others they're going to cover it
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.880]  because it is a big coup
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.880]  I remember about six months ago I was talking to
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.880]  one of my media friends in New York and they said
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.880]  you know the word is the new ex files is based on you
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880]  and I'll be quite frank I was just like okay whatever
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.880]  you know oh yeah I bet because I don't really watch a lot of entertainment
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.880]  I try to focus more on entertainment because that's where the real propaganda is
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.880]  and then a couple weeks ago I was like have you seen the newspapers?
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.880]  Chris Carter says it's based on you and the research material of infowars
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.880]  and then last night Joe Biggs text message me and he said
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.880]  you know after the playoff game the ex files is on I went oh thank you
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.880]  I'd forgotten because I'm just so focused on the ground with what's happening
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.880]  and then I went and watched it and at first I was like oh man
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.880]  you know this is well done but oh my gosh aliens give me a break
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.880]  and then by the end of it you find out it's not what you think
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.880]  and it's pretty amazing
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.880]  and basically large parts of it are directly from what I talk about here on air
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.880]  which again Carter's given us the credit
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.880]  it just shows the cultural victory as I was saying earlier
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.880]  when you start affecting the main biggest cultural memes
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.880]  the zeitgeist you know you're taking a wrecking ball of the system
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.880]  and they're really trying to figure out how to tackle us
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.880]  because I'm ready for him to kill me I'm ready for him to put me in prison
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.880]  and I don't say it to be macho folks you can't do this and not be committed
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.880]  but it's death for everybody anyways if we don't beat them
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.880]  I mean it's pure evil folks
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.880]  so let's go ahead and go to this one clip and later in the next hour
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.880]  I'm going to play them all after Patrick Manning leaves us I really appreciate him
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.880]  joining us today I got turned around with some of my times
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.880]  let's go ahead and go to blueprint for global domination
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.880]  that's the clip towards the end of the episode
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.880]  where the O'Malley character that's the Alex Jones character
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.880]  they even have our same studio basically it's amazing
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.880]  and some of the clips talking about what's happening here it is
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.880]  driven not only by corporate greed but a darker objective
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.880]  the takeover of America
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.880]  and then the world itself by any means necessary however violent
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.880]  or cruel or efficient
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.880]  by severe drought brought on by weather wars
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880]  conducted secretly using aerial contaminants
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.880]  and high-altitude electromagnetic waves
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.880]  in a state of perpetual war
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.880]  to create problem reaction solution scenarios
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.880]  to distract and rage and enslave American citizens at home
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.880]  with tools like the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.880]  which abridged the Constitution in the name of national security
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.880]  the militarization of police forces in cities across the U.S.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.880]  the building of prison camps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.880]  with no stated purpose
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.880]  the corporate takeover of food and agriculture, pharmaceuticals and healthcare
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.880]  even the military in clandestine agendas to fat and dull, sicken and control
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.880]  a populace already consumed by consumerism
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.880]  and I encourage you all to go shopping more
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.880]  a government that taps your phone, collects your data
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.880]  monitors your whereabouts with impunity
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.880]  a government preparing to use that data against you when it strikes
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.880]  and the final takeover begins
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880]  the takeover of America
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:56.880]  by a well-oiled and well-armed multinational group of elites that will coal, kill and subjugate
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.880]  happening as we sit here
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.880]  it's happening all around us
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.880]  the other shoe waiting to drop
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880]  it'll probably start on a Friday
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.880]  the banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.880]  digital money will disappear
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.880]  they can just steal your money?
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.880]  followed by the detonation of strategic electromagnetic pulse bombs to knock out major grids
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.880]  well, we'll seem like an attack on America by terrorists or Russia
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:26.880]  or a simulated alien invasion using alien replica vehicles that exist and are already in use
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.880]  an alien invasion of the U.S.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.880]  the Russians tried it in 47
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.880]  you can't say these things
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880]  I'm gonna say them tomorrow
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.880]  it's fear-mongering claptrap isolation
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.880]  is techno-paranoia so bogus and dangerous and stupid
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.880]  that it borders on treason
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.880]  saying these things would be incredibly irresponsible
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.880]  it's irresponsible not to say it
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.880]  especially if it's the truth
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.880]  now, another episode airs tonight, obviously I'm gonna be watching it
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.880]  because it is surreal to see a character basically based on yourself
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.880]  and then you're watching it on TV
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.880]  this I like, I don't like watching myself on television, I like watching other people
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.880]  but here's the deal, Project Bluebeam is partially declassified
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.880]  a fake alien invasion plan using holograms
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.880]  now we're gonna go to
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.880]  Pastor Manning of Otlo World Church
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.880]  who, in his own community, going up against the gangster
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.880]  Al Capone Sharpton
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.880]  has basically gotten removed off television
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.880]  a lot more working with other people
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.880]  exposing this FBI informant race-bear
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.880]  and we're gonna get into that
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.880]  we're gonna get into so much more
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.880]  otlo.org
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.880]  there is so much to get to with the world economy
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.880]  with what's happening on the planet
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.880]  with where this election is going
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.880]  with Bernie Sanders talking about socialism
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.880]  when you look at how socialism wrecks countries
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.880]  and how these global elite are tax exempt
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.880]  and won't even be touched by him
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.880]  it's amazing so
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.880]  there's so many places to go
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.880]  so many angles to cover Pastor Manning
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.880]  but I want to give you the floor for the next 5-10 minutes
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880]  as I know you've been sitting there in your studio
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.880]  revin up to talk about what's happening
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.880]  to ask you what's front and center for you
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.880]  before I get to what's front and center for me
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.880]  I'd like to just review some of the things I've been
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.880]  kind of listen to as I'm in green rooming
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.880]  here with you over the past few minutes
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.880]  and number one would be the X-Files
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.880]  in terms of a television production
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.880]  and listening to what's being
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.880]  told you about how X-Files
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.880]  is now mimicking or ripping off your broadcast type
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.880]  in order that they might be able to sell their programming
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880]  I think they understand something
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.880]  and all authors and people of creativity
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.880]  as you very well understand
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.880]  that they need an authentic if you will person
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880]  or projection
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.880]  that they need to put forward
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.880]  and info wars is exactly that
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.880]  I mean you can search 9 ways and 9 ways
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.880]  about something that is authentic
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880]  that isn't bought and paid for
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.880]  that you can be absolutely sure
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.880]  that the government does not support
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.880]  would be the info wars
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.880]  and not so much they want to praise you
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.880]  that's not what they want to do
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.880]  what they want to do is something that is authentic
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.880]  that when people watch it
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.880]  they know that this is real
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.880]  because actually what you do is on that order
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.880]  that's number one
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.880]  number two with respect to the type of people
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.880]  the alphabet groups that listen to you
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.880]  CIA, whoever else they are
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.880]  Homeland Security
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.880]  they have to listen to what you're saying
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.880]  and for reasons perhaps many people may not think
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.880]  is because the news reporters
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.880]  have an opportunity to get information
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.880]  from people in business and also in government
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.880]  that the CIA would not have access
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.880]  to Homeland Security
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.880]  the FBI would not have access just because
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.880]  of who they are as legal organizations
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.880]  but people are willing to talk to the media
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.880]  on the confidentiality
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.880]  and what they realize is that in order for them
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.880]  to find out exactly what's happening
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.880]  they're not going to turn on CNN
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.880]  because they get powder puff if you will
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.880]  information that's inauthentic
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.880]  they get information that sells commercials
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.880]  or sells automobiles
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.880]  but they don't get the kind of hard and fast
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.880]  information that's running underground
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.880]  that even the FBI
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.880]  and other agencies can't dig up
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.880]  and if I could just go one further as well
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.880]  I think what we need to realize
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:50.880]  the 9-11 perpetrators generation
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880]  they've not gone anywhere
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.880]  I think that people who were
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.880]  sadly misguided
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.880]  that 9-11 was Islamic
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.880]  as they were, they misguided by such
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.880]  think that somehow or another
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.880]  that the 9-11 perpetrators have gone home
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880]  taking their balls and they're now
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.880]  either sipping lemonade or smoking cigars
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.880]  whichever they may choose to do
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.880]  we need to know Alex
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.880]  and that those people that perpetrated 9-11
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.880]  as heinous as it was
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.880]  they've not gone away
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.880]  they've become even more deeply entrenched
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.880]  they got the Patriot Act through
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.880]  they got the National Defense Authorization Act through
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.880]  they committed a crime so incredibly monstrous
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.880]  that if it ever came out it will bring down America
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.880]  they committed a crime too big to fail
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.880]  and they've not gone away
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.880]  isn't it somehow or another they're not dangerous anymore
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.880]  they're more dangerous now than they were at 9-11
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.880]  as awful as that was
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.880]  so I think that we're living in a world
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.880]  where our eyes have to be open to this
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.880]  and what you do
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.880]  it helps open eyes
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.880]  thank you sir for what you do
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.880]  reach the tens of millions and again I wasn't
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.880]  worried about us
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.880]  Gonzo journalism wise
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.880]  just we have to cover it
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.880]  and what you said is totally true
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.880]  I believe Chris Carter is a good guy
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.880]  cares about what's happening
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.880]  I know his show is very popular
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.880]  but basically got canceled
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.880]  they said in the news in 2002
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.880]  post 9-11 we trust our government now
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880]  Fox doesn't want this even though it has the highest ratings ever
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.880]  they killed his show
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.880]  it's a victory for him to be able to bring it back
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.880]  and question the system
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.880]  we're doing so many others with the truth
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.880]  that they know they can't hold it back anymore
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.880]  and I would imagine though
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.880]  he's had to make some type of deal
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.880]  that there's going to be some spin at the end of this
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.880]  I mean maybe we learn
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.880]  I'm the bad guy in the show or something
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.880]  I mean I'm not holding my breath here
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.880]  but it is
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.880]  I don't know if they would necessarily project you as a bad guy
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.880]  I think again
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.880]  they're looking for something that really
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.880]  sells
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.880]  artists who are movie stars or whatever it is
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.880]  that want to be able to project a character
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.880]  an alcoholic, a drug addict, a drug dealer
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.880]  who have no personal experience there
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880]  needs to go and study someone who does that
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.880]  I think you're just a prototype for them
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.880]  in terms of
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.880]  not that you're not important
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880]  I understand absolutely
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.880]  no I get it it's the prototype
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880]  and they say they're taking our quote material
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880]  what we cover and putting it in the show as well
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.880]  so I guess it's a way of taking something real
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.880]  and turning it into fantasy
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.880]  yeah absolutely
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.880]  careful however
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.880]  that the audience and people
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.880]  worldwide that listen to you
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.880]  do not somehow
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.880]  allow them to turn your
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.880]  truth and authenticity into
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.880]  fantasy
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.880]  because it now becomes commercialized
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.880]  in these ex-file type programs
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.880]  and probably other things that are in the workings as well
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.880]  well I gotta say something Pastor Manning
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.880]  and I'm not kissing your hand in on this but it's true
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.880]  you come up with the most sophisticated
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.880]  deep analysis just ever
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.880]  because I'm sitting here too close to it trying to figure out
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.880]  what's going on and as soon as you said all that
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880]  I realized it's absolutely crystal clear
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.880]  and I was thinking about this last week
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.880]  you know they threatened to kill me
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.880]  they came after me they turned loose all these
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880]  dogs they've done all sorts of stuff behind the scenes
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.880]  that didn't work
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  and so now the devil puts his arm around you
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.880]  that's what Albert Speer talked about with Hitler
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.880]  you know a lot of you work with Hitler
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  you don't know what's the devil when he puts his warm arm around you
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.880]  and I'm not saying
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  that Chris Carter's Hitler
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.880]  or that even Fox is what I'm saying is
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.880]  is they just keep embracing you
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.880]  and loving you until you just can't help it
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.880]  and you're sucked in by them
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.880]  yeah well you gotta be aware of the odds of March
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.880]  as well I mean you have to watch out
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.880]  for that kind of a thing going forward
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.880]  but I think that
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.880]  the you have
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.880]  built an audience
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.880]  in such a way
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.880]  with information that right now
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.880]  it could be the straw
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.880]  that breaks the camels back
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.880]  if they came at you
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.880]  in the most minute way
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.880]  and I don't have any intel on this
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.880]  I just try to read
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.880]  the temple of the times
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.880]  you have to learn how to pick your fights
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  I had a teacher in college who said to me
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  pick your ruts
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880]  well because you're gonna be in them for a long time
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.880]  but they also taught me
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.880]  that you have to pick your fights you can't just
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  fight everything all the time
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.880]  you need to know
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880]  and so I don't think that right now will be a good thing
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.880]  to pick a fight
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.880]  what a voice like yours
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.880]  I mean I just don't
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.880]  I don't think it'll be a wise
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.880]  let's pull back from that and talk about the general view
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.880]  of where you think the American people are
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.880]  the people of the world because the fact that you're so successful
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.880]  I'm so successful isn't just the information
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.880]  overall it's also that people now
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.880]  are ready to wake up
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.880]  I think undoubtedly the season of awakenings here
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.880]  and the system's gonna strike back
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.880]  what is your sense of the pulse
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.880]  of the world right now Pastor Manning
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.880]  I sense that
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.880]  as you stated that people
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.880]  are ready to wake up
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.880]  I think they have awakened
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.880]  the next step Alex
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.880]  is that they've got to put on the
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.880]  armor that is necessary
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.880]  and they got to get dressed and ready for battle
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.880]  are they awakened
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  yes there's no doubt about that
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880]  there's very few people that still sleep on the process
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.880]  but there's another step to this process Alex
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  and it has always been
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.880]  throughout all of the length and breath
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.880]  of human history once the awakening
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.880]  you got to take a step
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.880]  you got to get up and you got to do something
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.880]  when God spoke to Abraham
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  they're in the land of Ur of the Calvities
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880]  and awaken him to what
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.880]  who the true God was
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.880]  he then told Abram
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.880]  you got to now get up leave your family
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.880]  and go to the land that I will show you
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.880]  that's going to be the next step
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  that people need
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880]  instructions because they don't know
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880]  what to do and you have to understand
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.880]  we've been heavily indoctrinated
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  with the propaganda
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.880]  that comes from the media
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880]  and black people in particular
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.880]  if I can say so
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.880]  they have been so propagandized
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.880]  with the civil rights paradigm
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.880]  example
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  of what to do with deal with every situation
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.880]  if it's Ebola
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  get out and march civil rights
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.880]  if it's a Tylenol
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.880]  with poison in it
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.880]  get out and march civil rights
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  get organizations that rise up
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.880]  like black lives matter
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.880]  if you look at the history of black people
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.880]  in particular
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.880]  but then go back and look at people
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.880]  in general Alex
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880]  we need a march and order
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.880]  they're awakened now to be sure of
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.880]  but there needs to be
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.880]  march and orders like Abraham got
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.880]  like Moses got
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.880]  and like George Washington got
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.880]  that's going to be the next step
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.880]  and I'm a little
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.880]  that I'm expressing that on your broadcast today
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:47.880]  I'm not
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.880]  reserved about it but
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.880]  this is the first time I've expressed that
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.880]  and I've known that because you know
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.880]  there are a lot of listening ears
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.880]  listening to you right now so now if they know what
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.880]  the next plan is is to create the next
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.880]  direction give the next march and orders
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.880]  they can somehow or another try to circumvent it
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.880]  but I think it's going to be so massive
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.880]  I don't think they'll be able to do so
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.880]  you're absolutely right and
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.880]  the good news is a lot of people in the system
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.880]  take two and realize they've been lied to
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.880]  but the people running the show
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.880]  have been planning this for a long time
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.880]  they're so committed and
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.880]  I know why folks don't want to believe this is happening
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.880]  because it is scary to realize exactly
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880]  what we're facing when we come back I want to talk
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.880]  about
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.880]  what's currently happening with the election
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.880]  I want to ask about your discernment
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.880]  why you like Donald Trump
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.880]  I mean I like him too
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.880]  and
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.880]  and I don't
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.880]  generally like to even come out and endorse
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.880]  political candidates it's just that
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.880]  he's the only one who's got a shot
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.880]  at beating Hillary in my view right now stay with us
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.880]  we're on the march the empires
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.880]  on the run
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.880]  hundreds of monkeys have been sent
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.880]  to Australia for so-called medical experiments
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.880]  that raise serious ethical concerns
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.880]  and potentially reveal what would happen
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.880]  if humanoids are grown in a lab
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.880]  more than 370 primates have been part of the
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.880]  research over the past 15 years
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.880]  and the scientists who conduct the tests
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.880]  are most likely entirely lacking
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.880]  in expertise essential to care for such animals
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.880]  Australia's royal society
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.880]  for the prevention of cruelty to animals said
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.880]  the experiments are extremely cruel in nature
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.880]  with one test reportedly involving a baboon
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.880]  who died after getting a kidney transplant from a pig
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.880]  the violent experiments were mainly conducted
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.880]  at the national health and medical research
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.880]  council baboon colony in western Sydney
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.880]  millions of dollars from research grants
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.880]  were used to conduct the experiments
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.880]  and hospitals conducted with studies refused
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.880]  to disclose the details about the number of primates
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.880]  which have been experimented on
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.880]  or how many had died or had been killed
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.880]  now hypothetically if these same scientists
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.880]  were to grow humanoids in a lab
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.880]  by combining human DNA with who knows what else
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.880]  do you really think they would treat them any different
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.880]  now think about that and this is Kit Daniels
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:05.880]  reporting for info wars dot com
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.880]  888-253-3139
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.880]  and it's that type of behavior
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.880]  that spurred me to do the research
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.880]  to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.880]  that was designed to smooth out
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.880]  and help children focus
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.880]  all of our children are hit with modern mind control
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.880]  television music fast food
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.880]  gmo's sugars you name it
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.880]  young humans have not yet developed
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.880]  their nervous system and are being hammered
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.880]  daily by globalist concoctions
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:19.880]  it's no wonder they can't focus
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.880]  in calmness
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.880]  it's no wonder that
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.880]  it's no wonder they can't focus in calm
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.880]  down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.880]  working with my team
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.880]  we set out to find the best formula
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.880]  with the highest quality ingredients
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.880]  that children would actually like and take
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.880]  we worked with the leading manufacturer

[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:57.520]  one. I want to go back to Pastor Manning. I also want to remind listeners that standing
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:05.280]  up in a place like Harlem, which is so Democratic Party run and so gangster run by the Clintons
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.080]  and Sharpton, all these folks takes a lot of courage and so you need to pray for Pastor
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:17.000]  Manning. And I would also go to his website, otla.org. And I would make donations there.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.600]  I would get his books. I would get his materials because I know folks in Harlem and for decades
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.160]  they've got free food for the kids at lunch and in the morning. And they just are a fount,
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:34.080]  a spring and a desert of evil there in Brooklyn. And he's now having a lot more success. He's
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.880]  always had success, but it's exponential now. He talked about that last time he was on.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.600]  So he needs to be in our prayers because I can't say enough to everybody out there.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.080]  If you're a citizen journalist just with a YouTube channel and a video camera in your
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.440]  small West Virginia town or your Northern California town or your South Texas town or
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:59.440]  your Missouri, Michigan, wherever you're at big city, small town and just have a camera
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.880]  report on things, give your views, give your commentary. And then you'll become a leader
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:08.280]  in your area just by osmosis. People are looking for that. Start an organization, a land rights
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:14.680]  group, a second amendment group. Just organize, get involved, run for office. Be the salt
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:20.240]  and the light in your areas and take action because people are ready. And then that's
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.880]  what this show is. It's also a platform to support all the other great people that are
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.080]  out there who also support us when we get attacked and we get demonized, when people
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:33.000]  lie about us and do dirty tricks and all the rest of it. But folks more and more see through
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.760]  that. And then getting back to what I was saying earlier, it is so essential that you
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:43.560]  go to infowarstore.com. It costs a lot of money to run these reporters, to run the servers,
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:50.200]  the building, the plane tickets, the legal. Thank God we've survived over the years some
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:55.640]  just grievous attacks. I mean, folks, real intelligence operatives trying to take us
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:01.160]  down. I mean, infiltrators, it's like something out of a movie, okay? I mean, it is, it is,
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.560]  it is crazy. And I don't get into it. I don't make a big deal out of it and it's gotten
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.920]  a lot better. We've gone through a lot though, okay? And you have to understand we are right
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.880]  at the tip of the spear. I don't like that. I wish there was a bunch of other people bigger
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:21.440]  than I was. And I'm glad there's people like Drudge that is or Donald Trump. I know Drudge
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.680]  is for real and good. I hope Trump is. We're gonna talk about Trump in a moment. But folks,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.960]  I mean, you want somebody to fight the New World Order? We're doing it. You want somebody
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:33.280]  to fight against these abortuaries and selling baby parts? We're doing it. And we go out
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:38.320]  there and get in their face in literal communist scum saying they love Satan appear and start
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.240]  attacking us. And they literally, black, white, doesn't matter, stumble around and have like
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:48.920]  green skin and fall down. I mean, they're just demons, folks. We have literal demon-possessed
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.520]  people show up when I go out in public drooling, you know, coming after me. And I'm not complaining.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.280]  I'm just telling you, you know how spiritual it is. If you have any doubt when you actually
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:03.360]  get up front with these people, it starts getting weird, okay? I mean, let me tell you,
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.080]  they come out from under rocks, okay? They're ghouls. They love that their temple right
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.760]  down the road for me two miles away where they're killing all those babies. And when
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.440]  you face them down at the Texas Capitol two years ago, they had Christians there praying
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.760]  and just women came out of their offices and came all over and just in dresses and suits
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.280]  and started going, hell Satan, hell Satan, hell Satan. I mean, there's the video and
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.600]  the state police are like, and they're like, I mean, it was a demonic event, folks. This
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.640]  stuff's real, okay? You start trying to save the kids and we're that close to it. They
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:39.560]  come out from under rocks. And I've always been a Christian, folks, but when we say a
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.920]  fight and evil point blank, it'll get you real close to God real fast because it's
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.040]  the only place you get any solace from that chill that goes up your spine and God puts
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:52.680]  his hand around his shoulder and says, it's all right. And then so many doors open up,
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.720]  but you've got to know, folks, this is real. And so we need your financial support more
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.520]  than ever to be strong against the enemy and to be able to really take action. We need
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.320]  you to buy the books, buy the videos, buy the nutraceuticals, free shipping on orders
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.840]  of $50 or more, 15% off, we're extending it for until Wednesday and then it's over.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:14.880]  X2, the good halogen, the true pure iodine with the super mill vitality that's just known
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.240]  concentrated herbs that, you know, help your body be more natural. They've got all these
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.880]  chemicals in the food and water suppressing us. Your purchases make it all possible, but
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.000]  so many times I've got to spend time, I could be spending on media and getting the word
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.120]  out and I'm not complaining, fiddling around, trying to get funds, fiddling around with
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.440]  accounting, trying to figure out how to be able to move forward as a good steward. And
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.360]  it'll make it a lot easier for us to withstand things and be strong in this fight. If you
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.160]  supply us the fuel to put in the tank to get the job done, or it's like the food for the
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.240]  body of this organization to be able to be strong and fortified and do this. So we have
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:39:02.200]  amazing products, a lot of big specials, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139. And finally,
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.600]  we also have the great four stage water filters that have the really fast flow for your showers.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.520]  This is the best unit yet. We still sell the other units. They're a little bit less. They're
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:13.360]  not as good. That's what I used before with the other system. Now there's something better.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.520]  We've got that. Pro Pure Pro Max. Just absolutely amazing what you breathe in and what goes
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.280]  through your skin, folks. So you can trust the government and take showers in it all
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.680]  day and drink it and enjoy the life of states and the rest of it. If I was you, I would
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:30.560]  do this and it's a win-win. We sell a high quality product at a very good price, free
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.280]  shipping, 10% off promo code water, and it funds our operation. It's a win-win, infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.760]  But again, I want to encourage you to go to otla.org and also support what Pastor David
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:46.920]  Manning is doing. In fact, I've been doing accounting and looking at things I'm going
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.760]  to be involved in and I'm going to give some money to Salvation Army. I know they do a
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:53.760]  good job. I'm going to give somebody to Pastor Manning. And I think I wasn't going to announce
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:59.280]  this, but I am because I think people should do it as well. I'm going to give money to
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.240]  the police department out in California, the police officer that got killed when he
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:11.480]  was going after a guy that had actually been here in town saying he was going to get me.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.720]  And I'm also going to give money to the Austin Police Department for the fallen officers
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:19.960]  there as well. Not because the police are perfect. They got big problems and there's
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.120]  a fight for their soul going on, but because we're not going to single people out because
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.320]  of what bad cops do and we're going to think about the people that have laid their lives
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.480]  down to protect the rest of us. And that's why I want to single out what Pastor Manning
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.520]  and countless others have done, guaranteed risk in his life going up against Al Sharpton.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:39.480]  And this isn't about praise here, folks. It's about realizing everybody likes to watch
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.440]  war movies or watch football or all this fake manly stuff. This is the real fight right
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.040]  now for America and the world happening. Now, I'm ranting. I want to go to calls, have
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.200]  after meetings with the 15, 20 minutes to the next hour, but getting into the place
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.720]  we are in history, what's happening, what you expect to come, what you think of Trump
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.080]  since the last time we talked to you and what in your gut you think is coming next to Pastor
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.080]  Manning.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:10.600]  Alex, before I get to Trump and the Sanders, I want to point out that we were successful
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.520]  in taking down Al Sharpton. And a month or so after that, we got a letter from our insurance
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.920]  company. We have a group package that covers, we do a lot of things, schools, education,
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:27.440]  teachers, ministers, property, the whole works. But we also have a segment of that group policy
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:33.160]  that we had that covered our professional work that we do, such as my announcing as
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.160]  well.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.880]  And they have threatened to cancel and they've given us a cancellation date, not on our other
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:44.840]  policy, but on the aspect of the policy of what I do in terms of my public life, in terms
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:50.600]  of what we're doing right now by broadcasting. And they had covered us nicely for the last
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:56.760]  few years. We've been broadcasting now for about a decade. But the fight is getting more
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:03.640]  intense. And what's going to happen now we get dropped by a carrier, the insurance carrier.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:09.040]  Our premiums are going to go through the roof to get someone to cover us in the event of
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:14.520]  somebody like Al Sharpton decides to take out a suit against us, or Obama, or anybody
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.880]  that we speak about, or Black Lives Matter. Anyone who would take a mind to challenge
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:25.920]  us in courts on the things that we say only air or whatever, we now have to find a very
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.680]  pricey insurance company that's going to cost us a lot of bucks. So I thought I would say
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:34.720]  that in the event that people don't realize that those are some of the things that you
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:41.000]  have to encounter going forward. Now, having said that, as far as Trump is concerned, I
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.960]  believe in Trump. Alex, I just believe, I believe the man. I just do. I think he loves
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:54.360]  America. I've sat in meetings with him and I've watched him. I've watched, I've talked
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:59.440]  to people that are close to him. Michael Cohen is one of the persons that's very close to
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:07.360]  Trump. And I believe one of the things that the Bible says you can judge a tree by his
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.200]  fruit. Well, one of the things that Trump is doing, he's upsetting the entire roster
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:21.080]  of political pundits, media. None of them are his friends. All of them are against him,
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:26.320]  it says to me that he's not playing ball with any of them, because once they start playing
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.520]  ball, being paid off, et cetera, they all kind of call us to get together and they
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:36.280]  go out to dinner at those fancy, French restaurants in Georgetown and drink cognac and smoke.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.440]  Those expenses are vanished cigars. And then they get on the Congress floor and they say
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.200]  they're fighting one another. That's not Trump. Trump, they're all after him. That
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:50.840]  within itself says to me that the man is real and I would urge everybody else, if you want
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:57.560]  to see this nation set free and a leader, a true leader, vote Trump. That's why I'm
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:05.840]  at with Trump. I am very sad that Rand Paul has blasted him as power hungry, delusional,
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.600]  fake conservative narcissist. Rand Paul was on just two weeks ago. I think he would make
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.360]  a great president, but I think his attacking Trump early on is one of the main reasons
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:24.400]  he lost his support to a great extent. But I guess my advice didn't get through to him.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.840]  And I was one of the people that he told me on the phone was actually twisted his arm
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.720]  into running for Senate. He didn't really think he could win. And I told him I would
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:37.680]  support him. The media has made a big deal out of that, but I do owe it to him to be
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:45.840]  just frank with him. And when he jumps on this bandwagon, all that does is tie him to
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.400]  the mainstream media. And I always told him and others I said the only way to destroy
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.920]  yourself is to be seen as part of the establishment. That's why they now go on the news and go,
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.520]  Trump says he's with the establishment. No, Trump said now I've got the establishment
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.160]  calling me and I'm not going to listen to them. They spun that that he's part of the
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:12.560]  establishment. Now, when you see all the establishment money lined up against it, right, right, absolutely.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:19.120]  A house divided against itself cannot succeed. So it's clear that they are against him.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:25.240]  And I would say of Rand Paul, you know, he can repent, he can turn around. And because
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:30.800]  I think Rand Paul could probably be good in a Trump administration. I do. I think he
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.200]  has some qualities that will be that will be helpful to the nation and the world. So
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:42.760]  a pilot, I mean, he could back, he can walk all that back and then become productive for
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:46.440]  all of us, I think. Well, I learned the inside baseball. These guys have played golf a bunch,
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:51.920]  had dinner together. Trump never attacked him. Let Paul attack him for months before
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:59.320]  he did anything. And he said that, you know, Rand Paul's a great golfer. And he liked him.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:04.320]  And I just don't know why he got the advice to go after Trump. And he's just doubled down.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.200]  In fact, let's play a clip of that. And I'm going to play a loose fair con clip here.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:13.080]  Let's go to this clip where Rand Paul blast Trump as power, hungry, delusional, fake conservative
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.840]  narcissist. Here it is.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:21.200]  No, I think sometimes narcissists have delusions. And I think he's almost to the point of being
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.140]  delusional about his own power. But what I worry about that is there is a distinct American
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:30.640]  tradition that I represent that says too much power gravitating into the ends of anyone
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:36.400]  is a mistake, Republican or Democrat. So we believe in a presidency limited by the Constitution.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.600]  I think that Donald Trump believes in no limits to power as long as it's coming to him. That's
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.520]  very, very worrisome to us. And I think conservatives across the country should be alarmed at his
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.520]  candidacy because I don't think he's a real conservative. I think he's pulling the wool
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.320]  over our eyes. And I think we'll be very sorry that he'll be the consummate dealmaker. And
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.040]  he'll be worse than anything we've gotten Washington. You just wait.
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:05.640]  Okay, then he's in the lead by being anti establishment. So now you act like establishment
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.440]  when I know Rand Paul is an establishment. And six, seven months ago, he was the main
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.320]  guy they were attacking. So I'm like, Oh, Rand Paul's the guy, the mainstream media
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.800]  is attacking him. See, but now he's, he's gone back the other way to get on all these
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.720]  TV shows, which all he's doing is shooting himself in the foot when people see him on
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:28.320]  CNN or MSNBC attacking Trump, they go, Oh my gosh, I hate Rand Paul. I mean, I just,
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.000]  I just don't get what he's thinking.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.080]  Well, Alex, you know, I just read an article this morning where Trump was explaining how
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:42.440]  our nation has descended away from the Constitution in an awful way. And as a result of that,
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.000]  we've become the nation that we become that he wants to make great again. And he pointed
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:54.320]  out Alex that the he's a builder. And, and one of the main traits of building buildings
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.720]  is engineering, like unto physics, and that there are certain laws within the building
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:07.480]  of a structure that will last and will be beautiful. That must be adhered to otherwise
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:14.560]  the whole thing will collapse. And he pointed, he used that example of how he has stayed
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:22.360]  within the law of building properties as we ought to stay within the confines of the Constitution.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:27.840]  He understands that blueprint. Yeah, he does. And so for Rand Paul to call him a power greeting
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.240]  narcissist is just below the pale. Nothing could be further from the truth. He understands
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.400]  that blueprint accurately.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.200]  Well, I've actually talked to a lot of folks that know Trump behind the scenes and they
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.240]  say that it's been a process of awakening for him. And he said that he said, Hey, just
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:49.000]  a few years ago, I was busy building things and building golf courses and hotels. Right.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.480]  He said, I didn't realize it was this bad. I mean, I used to work in this corrupt system.
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:59.600]  I admit it's all a big joke. I want to change that. And look, what we know is this, Rand,
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.120]  be like your dad. This is up on info wars.com. Ron Paul is great father, Dr. Paul. Congress
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:09.080]  is writing the president of blank check for war. The legislation makes the unconstitutional
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.200]  Iraq war authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park. It says geographically Obama
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:19.720]  or the next president in perpetuity until it's repealed can just attack anybody they
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:25.760]  want any country boots on the ground, including America. This is giving martial law powers
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.280]  to the executive branch and Congress handing over its war powers authority, just like it's
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:35.040]  done with its money to the federal reserve. I mean, this is such a big deal. And again,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.280]  here's his dad, one of the only people criticizing it. We were doing it last week. Thank God.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:46.360]  And so we ought to just hear from Rand Paul on Obama is being given war powers that only
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:52.200]  Hitler had. And we're not Germany folks in 1939. I mean, this is dangerous, dangerous.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.560]  We have not seen the proof that Donald Trump is a is a man on a white horse, Napoleon Bonaparte.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:03.000]  We know Hillary and Jeb and Obama are bad news. We know that.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:11.280]  Yeah. And I, you know, I think that we haven't seen the last of Obama, not hardly have we
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:12.280]  seen the last of him.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.080]  That was my next question. What do you because you really predicted? I mean, you proved me
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:19.280]  wrong about how I mean, I thought Obama would be bad, but nothing like this. What do you
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.120]  think he'll do in his last 11 months?
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:28.200]  Well, you know, he has he has so far, he has been able to take away most of our liberties
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:35.400]  and been able to put us asleep and to pit us against one another, to open up this nation
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:42.760]  to immorality and destruction. It's very little left for him to do except for martial law
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.680]  and to try to maintain some sense of power within the office. And I'm watching very carefully
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.680]  what's happening.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.800]  So when we come back, we'll we'll get into that. And then for 20 minutes, the next hour,
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:56.240]  take calls. Also have a clip of Lewis Farrakhan that I want to play for you where he agrees

[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:37.200]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad. But boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:42.360]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse. He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:47.360]  He wasn't a rich man by any means at less than $107 per month. Liberty on call.org would

[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:02.520]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:07.800]  diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Something shocking just happened in a Coast
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:12.520]  Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:17.040]  the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns out, the
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:21.040]  old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:25.800]  mountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.600]  for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:34.360]  of energy a thing of the past. Previously, this drink was only available to elite military
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:39.240]  units, but for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:43.760]  number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends. All they ask is that
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:48.360]  you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:54:12.920]  Greens, go to green75.com. That's green75.com. Green75.com. Here's the headline. Crew stock
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:19.240]  falls in prediction markets. Attack Trump, you start falling. Why'd you do that? They
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.840]  got these advisors in there that think they know everything. These politicos never did
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:28.720]  anything in their life who are still dialed into the old system that is like Confederate
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:34.600]  money after the Civil War. It's good to light the oven with. It's good to light the fire
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:39.760]  with. It's good for bird case liner or to wipe your butt in the outhouse with. I mean,
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:46.600]  the establishment is going out of style and instead they push this corpse Hillary on us
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:52.000]  who's having coughing fits in public. It looks like she's about to die. We've got all this
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.600]  craziness happening. We've got Obama running around on constant vacations and we've got
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:03.880]  him going after the guns with executive power. The Republicans trying to hand him total power
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:07.760]  because they want it when they get a Republican in. I mean, it's dangerous. I'd like to see
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:11.920]  Trump come out and criticize this war power authorization. It's open ended everywhere
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.560]  in the world because the one thing he says that bothers me. He goes, I'm really militaristic,
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.960]  but I don't want war with Russia and we shouldn't be in Syria. He says the right things there,
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:23.840]  but then says, but don't worry. I'm militaristic when we need to be. Well, so was Thomas Jefferson.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.400]  So maybe maybe I get where he's going with that, but going back to Pastor Manning and
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:33.160]  your calls for 20 minutes into the next hour for folks that are holding. What do you expect
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.440]  Obama to do? Finishing up with that. And then, and then Hillary, doesn't this show the arrogance
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  of the system pushing Hillary, uh, who is, who is so loathed across the board? I mean,
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:47.680]  that even a, a kook like Bernie Sanders could be beating her in many polls. And, and so
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:53.480]  where do you see that going? Actually, I think that Hillary has got some major health issues,
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.040]  Alex. Uh, I know that Bill has some major health issues. If you just look at him, how
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:05.200]  much he has slowed down, how frail he looks, uh, as much as Steve Jobs before he almost
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.920]  died. Yeah. He's awful. And Hillary, though she hasn't had gone through a major weight
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:18.560]  loss, uh, she is, she's not thinking clearly. She's not spontaneous. Uh, she's not quick
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:24.440]  with it. Uh, not that she really ever was, but I, I, you know, I, I think she's got some
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:32.640]  major health problems. And Bernie Sanders, uh, Alex has tapped into young people who
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:39.000]  are on church. They, uh, they graduated from liberal high schools and colleges where our
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.600]  government and constitution was not herald as the paradigm for the world. We've got
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:53.040]  a gap. We've got a patriot gap. We've got a loyalty gap. We've got a belief system gap
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:59.760]  that these young people were raised up in. However, Bernie on the other hand was a part
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:07.280]  of the tail end of the Bolshevik, Trotskyite, Russia, the communist, Marxist movement. He's
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.360]  a leftover time bomb from the Cold War. He is basically in my view a communist agent.
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.920]  That's a great way of saying it. And so that's why he's, that's why he's resonating. And
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.080]  that's why the young people that don't know God, that don't know our nation have been
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:25.040]  taught to hate our nation in schools are resonating with Bernie Sanders. That's what's going on
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.040]  in that event.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:30.360]  I tell you, I mean, they've already suckered them. The big money wants socialism because
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:34.800]  it domesticates people and these young people are so sad. They have no idea that NAFTA and
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:38.520]  GATT sold out their jobs. Now they're getting two, three degrees and then there's no job
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.640]  for them. And now they want Bernie to give them everything free. Where do they think
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:44.200]  it comes from?
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:49.200]  I think that, you know, that their parents are still around. They still believe that
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:54.240]  the Wall Street structure is still pretty powerful. And they're not really, they don't
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:01.000]  have to get out and earn a living for themselves as of yet. So they have not become concerned.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.720]  And they think that the wealth that's out there that their parents have should be shared
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:09.160]  with the people who have made no efforts to do anything or take advantage.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.880]  And they don't know that their parents who work for it invested the wealth that's been
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.400]  stolen with the derivatives and the whole house of cards is coming down and they want
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.480]  tyranny in place when it all goes down.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:25.360]  Right. It's a sixth system. And it's going to take a lot to undo this. I mean, we're
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.160]  into the 21 billion trillion dollars in debt.
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:31.920]  That's right. Stay there, Pastor. Back in 70 seconds.

[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:59.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:05.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:07.720]  a war on for your mind.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:14.080]  Folks, I'm not going to belabor this. I want to go right to your phone calls, Pastor David
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:19.880]  Manning's our guest. I'm Alex Jones. We just tuned in at infowars.com. Now there's all
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:22.520]  these great stations out there, new listeners tuning in every second, so it's important
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:28.200]  to reintroduce the show. I'm a libertarian Christian. I believe in treating people like
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:32.720]  I want to be treated. I've studied the elites we have. They have picked up a science called
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:39.720]  eugenics, which is basically just pure Satanism. And they are really doing bad stuff. And they
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:44.080]  want to be God. And I realized that there's nowhere to run in this future if we don't
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:48.000]  fight them. And it doesn't matter, even if it's the Antichrist and all this beast system
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:55.200]  comes to the fore, I've got to resist it or I'm working with it. And let me explain something.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:00.480]  I don't need to intellectually know that. I feel it spiritually because I have to even
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:05.280]  fight not joining it through fear, through passion, through lust. I'm wicked. I can think
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.560]  like they do. I can get into these mindsets. I can channel that energy. And let me tell
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:16.480]  you, it's bad news. And the world is just giving into it by peer pressure. So I just
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.840]  want to say this before you go to calls with Pastor Manning and get his take on it. You
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:27.440]  can't make a deal with this, folks. And the only safety is in resisting it. The only safety
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:31.720]  is in that for those of you that are intimidated by the Seville and just keep your heads down
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:36.080]  and go, Hey, I know you're right, but I'm staying out of it. You're already in it. If
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:41.120]  you choose not to fight this, you've already chosen. There is nobody in the stands on this
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:45.160]  one. You're on the field. Pastor Manning, do you agree with that statement? No, the
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:50.520]  military zone is the word Alex. You're absolutely right. But I think that we're maybe a large
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:56.800]  number of people are is that they just don't have the personal fortitude to stand up and
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:02.920]  choose to fight. And so they make the wrong choice. It isn't easy to stand up. I heard
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:09.880]  you say at the top of the broadcast an hour ago that you're in this even if it cost you
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:14.680]  your life or if you get arrested, people can't say that they don't have their strength. Now,
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:21.040]  they should be able to, but they haven't seen this nation in such a way as that they're
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:26.640]  willing to go to jail and not be able to call an attorney. They're willing to die for what
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.800]  they believe is right and just for this nation that people haven't arrived at that point
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.320]  yet. And that's just what that's at.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.500]  You're absolutely right. And it's because of that attitude we lose. They should be afraid
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:44.880]  of it coming into full power. They should get that it's not selfless and great to fight
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:52.200]  this. If you really study history, it's all we can do. They've lied to themselves.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:58.480]  I think that they believe that somehow another it's not going to come near them. It's going
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:05.560]  to, they'll put up with some inconveniences here and there, but it's not as drastic as
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:10.480]  perhaps it could be. And maybe if they just stick their heads in the sand, it'll pass
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:15.280]  them over. Nothing could be further from the true, but that's how they feel about it.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:18.240]  Well, that's it. We're going to break. I promise we're going to write back with Sean, Matt,
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:22.280]  Brandon, Scott, Craig and others for the final segment with Pastor Manning. Pastor Manning,
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:27.400]  as we go to break there, I want to ask you this one minute. People think they're going
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.280]  to be passed over by this system. What they need to get is it's all the preparation, the
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.600]  digging in, the webs being woven. All the evil we see now is just the preparation for
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:40.680]  this what's coming. And that's what you can feel in your gut, your spirit. You can see
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:45.240]  it too. I mean, your take on what I just said.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:50.680]  This is not uncommon. It happened in Nazi Germany. It happened in Rome. It happened
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:58.160]  with the Greek islands. It happened here in America. Only 17% of the people in America
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:01.600]  during the time of the revolution felt there was a need that they felt that they could
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:07.800]  just get along with King George. And so this is not uncommon. Humanity has not advanced
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:12.080]  to the point where people are now awake because of what they're eating or drinking and they
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:19.600]  recognize we got to stand toe-to-toe against the system. I mean, it just perpetrates itself.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:27.080]  But the thing that is consistent, Alex, is that the minority group that does take a stand
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:31.960]  always wins. They never lose. Never.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:35.720]  You're absolutely right. It's incredible time to be alive, folks. I mean, get yourself
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.720]  right with God. And then folks know I'm not a preacher, but the more this evil presents
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:45.680]  itself, the more I just run up underneath God's wing. Because I just, whew, that's the only
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:50.440]  way I can do this. And keep praying for us. We're praying for you as well. We'll be right
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:57.440]  back with your phone calls. Pastor David Manning, stay with us.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:33.320]  Turkish media also reported the presence of Russian engineers. And around 30 miles away,
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:37.520]  U.S. military personnel have established a secret air base and are building another one
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:42.080]  at a former agricultural airfield a few miles from the Iraqi and Turkish borders, according
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:45.240]  to Syrian activists. The Turkish government claims that stepping
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:49.800]  up maneuvers against the Islamic State. Those previously reported that Turkey has been buying
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:54.480]  up stolen Syrian oil from ISIS for at least several months. This is Kit Daniels reporting
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:20.480]  for info wars.com.

[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:11.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:16.360]  Alright, coming up after Pastor Manning leaves us, I'm going to play the first place winner
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.320]  from the Make Fun of Hillary contest. I'm going to get to more of the clips from the
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:23.440]  X-Files that is just basically classic Alex Jones, just to show the success we're having
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:26.920]  getting the word out. Thanks to all your support and spreading the word out there. We'll continue
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:30.680]  with phone calls and hit a bunch of news. El Salvador urges women not to get pregnant
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:37.960]  till 2018 to combat spread of Zika virus. Isn't that convenient? All these little loving viruses.
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:43.960]  Be sure and take all your shots. Brazil had the lowest, one of the lowest breast cancer
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.080]  rates in the world, but now since they accepted life of states a decade ago, it's exploded.
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:53.560]  Oh, but the big companies love us. Everything's fine. Let's go to phone calls here for Pastor
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:09:00.280]  James David Manning. Let's go ahead and talk to who's up first here. Let's go ahead and
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:04.040]  go to Matt in Ohio. Matt, you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:09.920]  Hey, thanks for having me. I just wanted to check in with you guys. Alex, for whatever
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.800]  it's worth, I'm a long time listener and first time caller going back to my buddies making
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:22.080]  VHS tapes of your show in Austin. I just wanted to send a little bit of health and strength
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:27.200]  to you guys for your day. I'm a long time musician, artist, educator in the field of
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:33.040]  popular culture. I just wanted to say it's great because you guys are giving a representation
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:38.200]  of a term that I've developed called cultural unification. And I think that this is just
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:44.720]  such a great vision of it and it's a great counter attack for every attack that either
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:51.000]  you face Alex or Pastor Manning faces because it's all about, you know, this whole divide
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.680]  and conquer, which you guys often talk about quite a bit. Exactly. Instead of fighting
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:01.160]  over, you know, race or where you're from or all these side issues, which they bring
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.540]  into exacerbate, there are real issues there. We are unified. You know, are you for the
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:09.640]  God of this world or are you for the God of life? I mean, it really does come down to
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:13.000]  that. That's why they're always attacking real Christians, not that the churches haven't
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.120]  been taken over and aren't run. Most of them, it's still that idea could stop them because
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.360]  we are brothers together and sisters in our ideas of love and liberty. And I think that's
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.680]  what you're getting at and that we don't want to be spied on and we want fair taxes and
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.760]  we want sovereignty and we want to be treated good and we don't want to be told our kids
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.880]  belong to the state. Pastor Manning. Yeah, you're absolutely right about that. All those
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:42.640]  things ditto goes right there, but I'm amazed at the Ohio listener. Matt has been listening
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:47.680]  to you from the VHS days. That's a long time. That is longstanding loyalty. My hat's off
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:51.760]  to you, Matt. That's right. I mean, I got used to, we were just on a few radio stations,
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.880]  but I made films that, you know, a couple of year and they would go out on VHS tapes.
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:02.280]  People make copies of them. Yeah. Yeah. So God bless you, Matt. Good to hear from you.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Texas. You're on the air with Pastor Manning. Go
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:07.200]  ahead.
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:13.640]  Gentlemen, how are y'all today? Good. Just fine, Sean. It's such a privilege to be speaking
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:18.280]  with you, Alex, especially a modern day. George Washington is what I was saying. Enough about
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.800]  me. The show's having success. It's dangerous, but where I'm no George Washington. Go ahead
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.800]  though.
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:31.440]  Well, to some of us you are. Just a few quick points. You know, I think you can answer right
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:35.360]  on just about everything you've discussed much. You know, it's funny, you just brought
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:38.840]  up divide and conquer. And one of the things that this is going to sound like something
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:44.680]  that's more divisional than bringing people together. But my biggest issue is, you know,
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.920]  when you start to discuss radical Islam or radical Muslims and people that are carrying
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.840]  out some of these horrific events, you know, my perspective is these people aren't even
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:58.760]  really human. They're more like animals. And how even if things hypothetically get under
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:05.880]  control, these individuals cannot be assimilated into our society. There's just really no
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:12.000]  room for them. So I guess my question, you guys, you know, if and when we take the Constitution
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.840]  and the government back and impose the rule of law that we've lost over the last few decades,
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:19.080]  what do we do with these people?
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:21.920]  Pastor Manning, I appreciate your call. That's a really good question. Let me just briefly
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:25.320]  say something and provide some of them before you got to be careful when you start saying
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:29.800]  people aren't acting like humans, because that's how you dehumanize people in the Middle
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:35.360]  East. They've dehumanized women that way in many areas. And we do the Muslims a favor
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:39.240]  when we say radical Muslims, they say, oh, you mean all Muslims. Well, okay, if he wants
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:44.040]  to say that, we will. The point is, is the people they're bringing in are people that
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:48.680]  have overthrown the non radical Muslim countries. Our government's behind that and they're coming
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:53.400]  here and they know it's not going to mix. And they know it doesn't fly and they know
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:59.160]  it doesn't work. And they hope we then respond in a totalitarian way and get rid of our own
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:04.320]  values and a response to these people. And in that process, we get dehumanized and brought
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.520]  down to that level. Now that said, you got to shut them off. You got to kick them out,
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.760]  but you've got to treat them kindly and nicely and not let the globalist destabilize their
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:18.640]  country to begin with. Pastor John, I get it down in Texas. I don't want to seem churchy
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:23.640]  or, you know, all spirit children, Pentecostal, that kind of thing, but the blood of Jesus
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:31.920]  is able, the blood of Jesus is able to wash anybody from a mindset that's incompatible
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:38.160]  with his word or the rest of humanity and bring them in and welcome them in. And that's
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:43.120]  the weapon that we will use the blood of Jesus preaching the word of Almighty God. I know
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:49.740]  that's a little bit preachy, but that is indeed an answer. Well, that's why the enemy does
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:54.520]  everything they can to make sure the real gospel is not taught. Absolutely. And promoting
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:58.480]  people that promoting this feel good gospel has nothing to do with Jesus. Oh, the feel
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:04.600]  good gospel is total witchcraft voodoo, name it and claim it. Total CIA on record with that.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:10.480]  The real gospel folks, it works. It's spiritual. It's electric. It frees people. It's real.
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.240]  When that door boom, they start changing and that's what the spirit of this world scared
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  of. Absolutely. The problem is, is they won't let us proselytize the Muslims and under political
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:24.600]  correctness. We're not supposed to either in this country. Yeah, that's the other problem.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:29.400]  Yeah, we got, we got, we got to focus. We got to put the word of God back center and
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:34.960]  focus on that that people wouldn't know that that's the way I know that Muslims are looking
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.880]  for a way and they're looking for an answer. That's why, you know, listen, they, they believe
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:45.080]  in Father Abraham, which means that their minds open to Jesus. They just need to be
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:52.800]  taught it and we need to demonstrate as Christians that Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:58.600]  And once they see that in us, then they'll be able to follow suit. Absolutely. They've
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:04.080]  even been like top psychologist and psychiatrist and big studies around the world, even with
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:08.080]  groups of people that ever been exposed to Western religion or culture where these people
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.560]  are basically possessed and they're cursing Christ and, and, and that it's only Christ
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:17.240]  that's able to free these people. I mean, the world hates Christ out of all the religions,
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:23.520]  out of all the hype, all of it. Jesus Christ is special. There's no doubting and the world
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:26.960]  is coming against it. I don't mean to get all preachy today, but that's what we're doing.
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:34.280]  That's the way it is. Let's go ahead and take another call here. Who's up next? Let's go
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:39.280]  ahead and talk to Scott in Maryland. You're on the air with Pastor Manning. Go ahead.
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  Good, brother.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  Hey, Scott.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Hey.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.880]  Hello. Yes, Scott. Go ahead. We said hi.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:53.640]  Yeah. Hey, I'm first off, I wanted to say on the start of that ex files thing, I think
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:59.120]  it would have been, uh, I think it's less of a compliment or a subliminal. Hey, keep
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:05.440]  an eye open. More to a very blatant, um, this is all hokey. Don't pay no mind to it. Uh,
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.120]  my point being that they got Joel McHale playing, uh, the part of the, uh, TV com, uh, of the,
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:15.560]  of the talk show host and he's, you know, just, I mean, you look at him in the show,
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:19.920]  he's comical. I mean, he's a comic to start with. Second off, I wanted to say that, uh,
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.080]  you know, you're speaking on the Bible and all. And, um, if you read Jeremiah and Ezekiel
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:29.960]  and, um, that, I mean, this is, well, when this happens, it's, it's, there's no, no
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:34.760]  getting away from it. I mean, when the Lord makes his mind up to do this, then it's done.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:39.760]  And, um, I feel personally that we're in the beginning of, of, uh, just what they went
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:43.160]  through. And when the same thing Israel went through when they turned their back, it's
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:46.920]  over. Um, you will now know that I am the Lord. I'm going to punish you and you will
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:51.280]  know now that I am the Lord. Um, there's no doubt that even if you don't believe in
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:56.360]  God, you let corruption in evil take over. It will eat your lunch and make you a poor,
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:00.920]  poor slave. And so there's no doubt the law of history. You become decadent. You become
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.600]  evil. You will be destroyed. You will be brought low. Pastor Manning.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:11.080]  Yeah. I think that what we have to realize is that there has to be the focus that there's
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:18.960]  only one God. And once that becomes demonstrated, we as Americans, that was the one thing that
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:22.680]  we held out to the rest of the world, and except for the Jews that demonstrated that
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:28.600]  early on, but once that becomes demonstrated, then those that are clinging to other gods
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:33.920]  and other ideas will have to step back and then want to seek this way. And so when we're
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:38.680]  looking at Jeremiah and the Ezekiel and all the others had to do, they had to fight off
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:44.200]  disbelief in their times. And in their days, the same way that we have to fight it now,
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:49.600]  but the one principle way in which God worked consistently as a thread from the Bible, from
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:55.040]  Genesis to Revelation, this thread is never broken by focusing on the people to whom he
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:01.560]  has chosen and blessed that they might be the example. And you know, just to say this
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:08.920]  and as you raise this as a point, you know, God can take a person like Alex Jones and
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:15.720]  get his voice out there and people can listen to what he said. No, he's not all preachy.
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:22.240]  He's not having you say a catechism, but he's bringing a truth. That's what people misinterpreted
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:27.920]  about Jesus. He brought a truth that they thought wasn't preachy enough, but it was
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:34.560]  a truth that set them free. And so where we to go back to the time with Jeremiah, Ezekiel
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:40.280]  or Elijah, one of those, I think we might find ourselves with some contemporaries today
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:45.000]  doing a similar kind of thing. That's going to take another 300 or 400 years of history
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.440]  before they get paradigm as such.
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:53.480]  Absolutely. Scott, thank you. I mean, undoubtedly, the show is mixing real things that are happening
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.920]  with entertainment so that when the general public hears that they just say, oh, that's
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:02.560]  just X files. But the fact that they've had to do something like this is another sign
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:07.360]  that Congress has a 9% approval rating that the system knows it's in trouble and that
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:11.840]  when people stand up, you can affect the culture. It's not just a one way street where Madison
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:17.640]  Avenue and Hollywood dictates everything. We can take action culturally and see it starting
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:22.760]  to be mirrored there. We have power in this world as well, not just those that serve the
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.760]  system.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:28.600]  Pastor Manning, thank you so much for spending an hour and 15 minutes with us today. And
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:34.200]  of course, we'll continue to watch and listen to your shows, otlaatlah.org. Please continue
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.600]  the great work and God bless you. Thank you for the time.
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.440]  God bless you, Alex. Thank you for having us.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.880]  Well, thank you, sir. It feels good to have him on. My gut feels good when I'm talking
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.080]  to Pastor Manning. You know how that is. You might like some people, but there's a weird
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.160]  feeling about him. You get a good feeling with that guy. I just love him. All right,
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:53.400]  folks, we're going to be right back on the other side of this break and we're going
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.720]  to get to this Hillary contest winner, then to the rest of your phone calls and a bunch
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.320]  of news.
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:03.240]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:08.520]  diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Something shocking just happened in a Coast
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:13.240]  Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:18.040]  the young bucks and head to head fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns out the old
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:22.040]  guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:26.520]  of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:30.360]  for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:35.080]  of energy a thing of the past. Previously, this drink was only available to elite military
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:39.960]  units, but for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:44.480]  number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends. All they ask is that
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:49.080]  you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:58.120]  Greens, go to greens75.com. That's greens75.com. Greens75.com.
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:02.400]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:07.160]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:11.920]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine. But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:18.080]  can keep chloramine out of your water. New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey

[02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:03.640]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinewetz. I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:07.280]  our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:10.800]  ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:15.680]  started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:20.440]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy. Soon after it
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:24.800]  was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel room keys, and
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.920]  even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed ID Stronghold to
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:34.560]  share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of misconceptions
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:39.880]  out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected. Please go
[02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:44.080]  to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:48.520]  to protect your personal financial data. You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct

[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:01.760]  Something just happened that is explained when survival food is literally flying off
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:06.880]  the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country. It caught me totally by surprise
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:12.680]  and it involves FEMA. I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof. Revealing
[02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:17.000]  their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:23.920]  doing. Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again, but be warned it's really

[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.640]  Welcome to your life. There's no turning back. Is your life watching mainstream television
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:16.320]  in the NFL or is it studying the mysteries of the universe? By the way, Richard Reeves
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:21.280]  is popping in to come out in the next segment out on the campaign trail in Iowa. I went
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:28.120]  to a Bernie Sanders event of socialist mind control victims. He's been giving us an update
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:33.560]  on that, joining us a little bit in the next segment. But before we do that, let's go to
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:41.760]  the winner, Hillary, a joke that isn't funny. First place $5,000 winner, YouTube Radio Nation
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:59.680]  One is the handle. And so here is the winning entry. When I heard about the make fun of
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:06.760]  Hillary contest, I really got excited. Dozens of ideas flooded my consciousness. After all,
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:13.560]  Hillary is a dumpy, stiff, humorless cartoon figure with a string of outrageous lies and
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:20.400]  embarrassing gaffes that would have destroyed anyone else. What a juicy target for ridicule
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:26.280]  and parody. One of the ideas for a Hillary is the wicked witch of the West, with the
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:33.000]  faces of her many evil familiars grafted onto the bodies of the flying monkeys. I always
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.720]  found it interesting that Hillary and Billery seem to surround themselves with physically
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:46.520]  distorted angry misanthropes such as Robert Reich, Donna Shalala, James Carvel, and Madeline
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:53.360]  Albright. The Clintons had apparently tapped into the psychology of physically repulsive
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:26:00.320]  people who were angry at the world with a thirst for political power to use as payback
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:08.240]  against the normals like the Morlock's feeding on the Eloy and H.G. Wells' Time Machine,
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:14.460]  or how about that creepy Star Trek episode where a bitter, rejected girlfriend takes
[02:26:14.460 --> 02:26:20.760]  over Captain Kirk's body so that she can be the captain of the Enterprise like a bitter
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:28.880]  old Hillary having to use Bill Clinton as a front and beard for her own warped ambition.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:35.680]  How about depicting her as the revenge-driven brain that wouldn't die, that old 1950s horror
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:42.280]  schlock classic about a woman whose scientist fiancee got into an auto accident that killed
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:49.840]  her body but left her head alive thanks to his scientific acumen. Naturally, being a
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:56.160]  dismembered head in a dish of blood is a rather unpleasant experience, so the bodyless
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:04.280]  woman becomes unhinged using her hate-driven mental powers to control a brainless body
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:09.920]  that just happens to be laying around the lab to do mayhem. I thought this the perfect
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:16.160]  metaphor for her domineering relationship with the flandering, distracted Bill Clinton
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:23.480]  as she acted as shadow president. I begin to craft the video for the contest, but something
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:31.160]  kept me from exploiting the idea of a funny Hillary. Alex, you have used comedy very effectively
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:38.400]  to cut pompous leftist down to size, but Hillary is something quite different. Can we really
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:43.120]  afford to laugh at the woman who started out her career as a crooked intern during the
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:52.080]  Watergate scandal, a senior citizen robbing crooked shyster in white water, the woman
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:58.760]  who presided over the massive Clinton body count in Arkansas, the theft of the FBI files
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:05.600]  that adversely influenced politics for decades, not to mention the kidnapping of Elian Gonzalez,
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:11.960]  the bombing of the Serbs, the destruction of the Middle East and the Benghazi compound?
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:17.640]  Imagine using its charitable organization to pass government secrets and favors, and
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:24.320]  in the process, steal millions. This avaricious woman may just be the most despicable and
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:34.040]  dangerous figure in modern times. As a friend would say, she is a toxic bitch. Sorry, Alex.
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:39.080]  Even at the risk of blowing 5G's, the thought of this creature with her finger on the nuclear
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:46.040]  button as the evidence mounts that she quartered back the burning of the Waco church leaves
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:54.560]  me laughing until I cry. We came, we saw, he died. Well, Al Parker, I'm here to tell
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:29:02.520]  you right now that you are the winner. Great job, Radio Nation One, and I don't know Al
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:07.080]  Parker, but I can tell you right now, he'd be great whatever city he lives in to be one
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:12.800]  of our auxiliary reporters and file reports for us and go out and cover events. What a
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:18.840]  great radio voice, what a great writer, what a great researcher, what a great brain. I
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:25.120]  can tell you right now, a guy like that who had like a one hour Sunday show on, say, ABC,
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:29.760]  just sitting up there reading a newspaper and making comments at a kitchen table would
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:35.400]  have twice the ratings of Face the Nation. That's what people want is real information,
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:40.760]  real analysis, real common sense, not a bunch of slick political hacks and fancy suits reading
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:45.320]  teleprompters so they could show off to their mommy about how far Stephanopoulos went, what
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:55.320]  a big boy he is. We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:30:02.720]  Hundreds of monkeys have been sent to Australia for so-called medical experiments that raise
[02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:07.080]  serious ethical concerns and potentially reveal what would happen if humanoids are grown
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:12.440]  in the lab. More than 370 primates have been part of the research over the past 15 years.
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:16.560]  And the scientists who conduct the tests are most likely entirely lacking in expertise
[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:21.080]  essential to care for such animals. Australia's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:25.200]  to Animals said, the experiments are extremely cruel in nature with one test reportedly involving
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:29.640]  a baboon who died after getting a kidney transplant from a pig. The violent experiments were mainly
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:33.920]  conducted at the National Health and Medical Research Council baboon colony in western
[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:37.880]  Sydney. Millions of dollars from research grants were used to conduct the experiments.
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:41.600]  And hospitals conducted with studies refused to disclose the details about the number of
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:45.320]  primates which have been experimented on or how many had died or had been killed. Now
[02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:49.720]  hypothetically, if these same scientists were to grow humanoids in a lab by combining
[02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:54.040]  human DNA with who knows what else, do you really think they would treat them any different?
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:58.600]  Now think about that and this is Kit Daniels reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:05.280]  Her listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:10.440]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months needed to get my digestive
[02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:14.600]  system working correctly again. So I stumbled on the X2.

[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:29.080]  I did the deep cleanse.
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:33.360]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have

[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:08.960]  Talk about the effects.
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:12.840]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive to go to the gym. I feel like

[02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:11.040]  I'm up here in space. I'm looking down on you.
[02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:18.760]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:27.680]  Yes, it's rock and roll sing along time with Alex Jones. My laser trace, everything you
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:36.600]  do, you think you've private lives. The nothing of the kind. There is no true escape. I'm
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:47.320]  watching all the time. I'm elemental. My sight is clean. I am perpetual. I keep the country
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:48.320]  free.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:55.040]  Talk about ahead of the time. I think that song came out electric iron like the mid-80s.
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:06.520]  Mr. Halford really has some vision. You can't fill my stare. You don't know I'm there.
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:17.440]  All right, let's stop right there, ladies and gentlemen with the poetry on the NSA spying.
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:24.760]  But you do not keep the country free. We've had the former director of technicals actually
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:32.160]  ran the NSA operations against the Soviets and no one could be spied on in the United
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:37.200]  States unless they were a foreign asset. And then they got warrants to spout. Everybody
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:43.240]  else they were talking to and they could target and shut people down like that. And of course,
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:50.000]  that was also in the age of human. They've gotten rid of 90 plus percent of human intelligence,
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:57.120]  which then allows them to feed disinfo through the Internet through these systems. I'm gonna
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:05.160]  talk about that more, but I love how they just sit there and deny, deny that they're
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:08.880]  even spying on you. And then when they get caught, they go, oh, it's to keep you safe
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:12.240]  when our own government is running the Islamic radicals. I'm going to go to your phone calls
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.640]  after we talk to Richard, but there's a whole stack of this news here. And this is the latest
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:24.920]  at info wars.com. Islamic murderer Christian girls exist to quote pleasure Muslim men.
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:32.280]  I mean, look, look, this sounds like incendiary propaganda. This is what's going on because
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:42.280]  they're coming from Muslim countries where women are absolutely lower than dog flesh.
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:55.840]  I just watched the weird leftist with their sycophantic dandy love of radical Islam. And
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:02.160]  it's sick. They really are mentally ill scum. There's a new article out with top psychiatrist
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:06.720]  saying that Angela Merkel is clearly mentally ill. There's more analysis coming out on Obama's
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:13.560]  clearly insane, totally narcissistic. You've got Hillary won't tip anybody constantly has
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:18.200]  people fired screams at everyone. Same thing with Merkel. But then they go out and they're
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:23.360]  all sweet, the little jihadis. I mean, it's just crazy, folks. You know how somebody is
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:28.280]  by they how they treat little people. I can be around somebody really cool, really famous,
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:32.760]  really nice to me. And they treat some waiter like trash for no reason, or they treat little
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:38.360]  people like scum. I will never talk to them again, because that's everything I need to
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:43.920]  know about them. Now, conversely, somebody from the government or some system gets in
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:47.680]  my face, tries to treat me like scum. I'm going to get back in theirs as well. They
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:51.480]  treat me with respect. I'm going to respect them. But I tell you, we get disrespected
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:56.160]  as a country and as a people because we lay down to a lot of bull. Melissa Harris Perry
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:00.600]  gets on TV on countless shows and says your kids belong to the state and parents aren't
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:05.320]  doing a good job. That woman should have been boycotted out of this country within a week
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:12.600]  of making an un-American, a totalitarian statement that's only acceptable in hell holes like
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:20.920]  North Korea, that trash, that dangerous bug-eyed rat who knows full well what dirty communists
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:28.360]  is up to, Bernie Sanders. He's not a socialist. He's a died-the-wall flamin' dirtbag. There's
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:36.200]  no such thing as a socialist. They're all communists. And communist work for the Bank
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:42.200]  of England and the Federal Reserve on record, the criminals couldn't fully take down America,
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:48.520]  so they took our money and financed the Bolsheviks. We should be on our knees apologizing to Russia
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:54.280]  for what we did. Our ancestors allowed the globalists to send a hundred thousand-man
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:38:01.240]  army, just like they've done in Syria, of Americans into Russia who were Russian-speaking
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:06.360]  first generation, second generation immigrants, and they took that country down and they murdered
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:12.360]  tens of millions of people, mainly Christians. And you look at sacks of trash like Hillary Clinton
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:22.440]  or Crystal or any of these neocons, they are the children and the grandchildren of the kings
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:31.160]  of the Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky, V.I. Lennon. And I tell people this, they go, really? They go,
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:35.400]  look it up? They go, wow, I didn't know. Oh, you didn't know the people attacking Trump
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:42.440]  are the literal children and grandchildren of the Bolshevik Revolution quarterbacks?
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.280]  You know how much trouble we're in, people? Thank God for George Washington, the Second
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:54.120]  Amendment, because we're going to try to fix this peacefully, but let me tell you something,
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:39:00.360]  garbage. Listen, the poor Russians are tough, smart people, but they've been under hundreds
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:05.800]  of years of the czars and feudalism and never come out of the dark ages. So they didn't know
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:10.760]  what they were up against. We've got to jump on you, we know what you're up to, and we're fully
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:16.600]  aware of your garbage. Now, you thought you just poisoned us with fluoride vaccines and stun us
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:21.800]  and we can still take us over. You, you, you are falling, you are rotting, you are ugly,
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:28.760]  you are stupid, you are bad, you are pathetic, you will fail. We can smell your blood.
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:35.720]  You want to fight? You better believe you've got one.
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:43.800]  And as the word spreads around the world of how the paradigm really works,
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:51.160]  countries are going to line up against you. Now we go to Richard Reeves, who's on the road,
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:56.840]  covering campaign 2016. Long time political correspondent Richard Reeves. Richard, tell
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:01.960]  us exactly where you are via video Skype right now and what you notice going into the warren
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:10.200]  of the Gollum ghoul-like servants of Hillary's beard, Hillary's fake competition to make her
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:18.520]  look less radical, Bernie Sanders. Alex, I am in Iowa City, Iowa, and it's very exciting though
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:23.240]  to see, you know, you're correct about Bernie Sanders, absolutely spot on target about Bernie
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:28.760]  Sanders, but you know what? Bernie Sanders has a chance to take Hillary Clinton down
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:33.800]  in this primary election season, where she can't even get the national nominee for the
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:37.880]  Democrat. That's right, she's so popular, she's so unpopular in the drudge poll,
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:43.240]  he got like 28%, she got 0.88, which is figurative for her to say Hall Hitler,
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:47.160]  because that's the kind of woman she is, so I guess that's her number. But expanding on that,
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.720]  it's just amazing. So break it down the numbers, you got a big guest coming in later in the week
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:55.800]  to break down the demographics, how we can defeat them and get Donald Trump in.
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:02.200]  Well, I've been saying since early December, this is Donald Trump's election to lose. Now,
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:08.440]  it's time for him to really win. I think if I were Donald Trump, I would be exposing Hillary
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:14.760]  some more about her predatory habits against women and against children, and I would also expose
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:19.320]  eugenics. I tell you what, you've been talking about it all day on today's broadcast,
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:24.200]  that is one truth that Donald Trump has not touched upon yet. Planned Parenthood is not about
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:29.800]  women's health. Planned Parenthood is about eugenics. Talk about swinging female votes,
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:35.160]  talk about swinging minorities. That's how Donald Trump can do it. Donald Trump, I'm asking you,
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:40.040]  get out there, talk about Planned Parenthood, talk about the eugenics program, talk about
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:45.720]  Margaret Sanger being eugenics proponent, talk about Hillary Clinton following up and being
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:50.360]  right in Margaret Sanger in the New World Order's pocket and pushing eugenics, whether it be fluoride
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.920]  and lead in the water or Planned Parenthood or all those different things you laid out earlier
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:59.720]  today in the broadcast, Alex. Absolutely. Now, let's get into the demographics, the numbers,
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:04.440]  what we're seeing with Sanders, what you saw at the cult event. Can this cultist, more honest
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:11.000]  about his communism, defeat the larger CIA rat that is Hillary? Well, that's one of the beautiful
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.240]  things about the New World Order. They've built this enemy of communism and socialism here with
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:21.400]  their liberal education system, the public schools that are a disaster, the colleges that are liberal
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:26.040]  campuses of disaster. Well, you know what? They've built themselves a new enemy because they're
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:30.840]  about to take down Hillary Clinton, their establishment candidate, their Bilderberg pick.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:36.920]  Okay? So Bernie Sanders got 2,000 people to about four or five different events yesterday in total.
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:43.560]  He's had 50,000 people turn up for him in Iowa at his events. And he had, if I remember correctly,
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:50.920]  over 2 million individual donors with an average of $27 a piece. So he's got a war chest.
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:56.440]  He's got a $54 million war chest. So that means he can go on beyond Iowa. That means he can go
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:01.080]  beyond that New Hampshire. And it's not because I'm excited about seeing him win. I'm excited
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:07.480]  about seeing him take Hillary down and let's get the wish done with. Imagine folks walking by on
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:12.440]  the street and seeing a reporter yelling scream. That's what it's all about. Wearing our open,
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:17.960]  bias to tell the truth and fight as America is being destroyed to save the country.
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:21.720]  Richard Reeves. Now calming down a bit, Richard, as you stand out there in the misty rain,
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.000]  you're doing a great job. Let's go over some of the demographics. I mean, he really is beating
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:31.160]  her in most polls. They're trying to suppress that. I really expect if he's not a total ringer,
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:36.920]  because he played nice with her for a long time, she attacked him, that he's not Obama part two,
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:42.120]  the heir apparent. I really think that they'll blow his airplane up, they'll kill him or something.
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:47.320]  He didn't really have any skeletons so far that have come out. What's the end tell? I mean,
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:51.880]  you think Sanders is for real or is he just a total shell for Hillary?
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:59.320]  No, I think he's for real. I think he is who he is and I gotta hand it to him. He's a hard worker.
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:04.920]  He's getting these mind zombie socialist bots that the New World Order has created. He's getting
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:09.240]  them to show up his events. Normally they would be lining up for a Harry Potter movie, but instead
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:13.880]  they're lining up for him. You're right. They are really stupid, stupid, waddling, soft, dumb moron.
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:19.560]  Sorry, go ahead. But the good news is, look, they're awake about certain financial aspects
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:26.040]  of the New World Order. I think with Donald Trump out there, he will be able to judo that support
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:32.120]  to himself in the upcoming general election. I think when Bernie goes by the wayside or if he
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:37.960]  wins the National Democrat nomination, I think Donald Trump wipes the floor with Bernie Sanders.
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:43.240]  But in the meantime, if Hillary goes down, we'll not shed a tear. Absolutely not. So the numbers
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:49.480]  are, oh, more encouraging, great news. A poll came out yesterday. Alex, I'm telling you, you've worked
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:56.680]  decades about this. I've worked decades about this. This is so exciting to see. They had a poll
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:02.040]  come out. Fox quoted it. I don't know which poll it was. Donald Trump, 39% in Iowa.
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:08.760]  Ted Cruz, 34% in Iowa. That's 73%. If you had a Carson Cruz, Fiorina, Rand Paul,
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:14.360]  the, you know, the other outside, if you had them all up, that's got to be 80% now ready
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.120]  to flush incumbents down the toilet, Alex. Absolutely. They think the Republicans can win
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:23.400]  47 states top analysts that they are scared to death. And I tell you, if Trump is a shill,
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:27.560]  no one will forgive him. He will have nowhere he can go. If he isn't for real, but I've talked to
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:33.000]  so many people on unfair, I'll leave it at that. If Trump isn't for real, he's the greatest actor
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:38.360]  I've ever talked to. And I'm just going to leave it at that. But obviously the media is listening.
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:43.960]  I don't care what the enemies know, you know, but the point is Trump, there's a stack of articles
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:48.840]  today saying Trump, ex files, Alex Jones, he's a nut. You know, he's this and that. You know,
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.480]  they're really getting it. But the point is Trump smart enough to want the, the Patriot base.
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:57.880]  That's the base. That's the winning team. You know, it's much bigger than the, you know, 13%
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.280]  black vote that puts the Democrats in every time. So, so that's the third rail is the original
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:07.320]  Americana Patriots of every race, color and creed. Trump knows that. But man, I'm telling you,
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:11.480]  the, all the money they're putting against him, they're not doing that for show. Okay.
[02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:15.400]  And they're not talking about that in the media. So that shows he's real for whatever reason,
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:20.200]  they do not want him in. So this is an epic battle. All these people want to watch NFL football all
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.240]  day. Hey, forget that. This is the true blood sport. This is the true gladiatorial event right
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:30.680]  here, but it's for real marbles. That's right, Alex. Think about this. If you were Donald Trump,
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:35.240]  you're at a point in your life, you're at a point on this planet where you can be the biggest
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:40.280]  modern day Benedict Arnold in history, or he could be the biggest George Washington in modern day
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:44.200]  history. What choice would you make, Alex? It's a simple choice. You've got to be the George
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:49.320]  Washington. You've got to choose George Washington. So Donald Trump, we choose George Washington.
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:53.080]  That's right. And I think Donald Trump is going to choose it. Listen, if I were Donald Trump,
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.720]  I'll tell you exactly what I do right now to win this race. Number one, I would reach across the
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:02.040]  aisle to Ted Cruz right now and I would say, look, Ted Cruz, you have been hated in Washington,
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:06.360]  but you know what? That is a badge of honor. I love you for it, brother. I understand why you
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:10.760]  took out a loan at Goldman Sachs. I understand why you did a Citibank loan, because if you hadn't
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:16.360]  had done that, Lieutenant Governor Dave Dudehurst, Texas would be the senator right now. And he's
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:21.960]  a really bad guy. He's a really bad news. So I forgive Ted Cruz for that. And on top of that,
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:28.440]  it was a loan. It wasn't big beaking fees like Hillary Clinton had from Goldman Sachs. $600,000.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:32.360]  Well, let's expand on that. I mean, take a loan where we can. The point is, let's expand on all
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:36.280]  that. It's the biggest bank out there where he's supposed to get the loan. The point is, is that
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:43.960]  Cruz, I think overall is for real. He's voted good, but he's smarter politically, I think,
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:48.600]  than Rand Paul. And I'm not knocking Rand Paul, but what is he doing attacking Trump
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:53.400]  viciously? That's going to make him go down in the polls. Where are they coming up with this?
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:48:01.880]  Well, you know, we've had Rand Paul red flags for a few years now. And I want to love Rand Paul.
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:07.720]  And I still love Rand Paul. That's just like we want to love Glenn Beck. But you know what?
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:13.400]  The red flags have come out right in the middle of the Texas State Convention in 2012, when your
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:17.880]  dad is still running for president. You came out endorsed Mitt Romney in the middle of the
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:25.080]  Texas State Convention where your dad is speaking. And now he's doing this, acting like an establishment
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:29.560]  party hack. You know what? Rand Paul, here's the thing. Like Alex said earlier, why aren't you
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:34.360]  attacking Obama? Why aren't you talking about the fact that 80% of people might vote out there
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.760]  in comments today? You know what? If we vote on all these starting incumbents and if we vote in
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:44.280]  some great House members, brand new House members, brand new Senate members, shake the tree, shake
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:48.440]  the Washington tree, then you know what? We can withstand a bad president. And I was forgotten when
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:52.120]  he didn't endorse his dad. Well, why do you think he called him up and wanted to come on the show
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:55.880]  two weeks ago? Because I want to be friends with the Senator Paul. I want him to win his Kentucky
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:49:01.080]  seat, but he's acting so establishment now he could lose that. We need all the friends in the
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:06.280]  Senate we can get. We need all the friends in the House we can get. Why he's doing that is just
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:11.800]  beyond comprehension. He obviously is not listening to this show. I don't know who he's listening to.
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:17.320]  Rand Paul, whoever it is you've been listening to, Alex has said it, turn them off, fire them,
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.880]  get them out the door. You know, you need to be like Donald Trump right here and say you're fired
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:29.720]  to probably about half your staff. Well, it rains out of it right now, so it doesn't really even
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:35.400]  matter. I just, whatever, I mean, the truth is the truth. And you know, it is what it is. And
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:41.800]  all I know is he's been betting on Trump falling and it didn't happen. And we need him in the
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:47.560]  Senate. He helped beat the gun grab bills. Rand Paul's a great guy. He is good. He's done good
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:51.880]  work. And Richard, we're going to continue to track this with you out there as we accelerate
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:55.960]  towards seven days till the key caucuses. We will talk to you again very, very soon, my friend.
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:00.120]  Let me say a couple more things real quick. Donald Trump, I'm going to be at two of your
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:05.640]  minutes tomorrow. I've got two pocket constitution for you. I've got two pocket constitution. You
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:10.200]  need to show this constitution. You've got to talk about the constitution. You want to win this
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:14.840]  race? Make friends with Ted Cruz, not after the Iowa caucus. Make friends with Ted Cruz. Right now,
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:19.240]  tell him you're going to put him as an attorney general or you're going to make him the VP if
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:22.760]  you can get this. I know you're excited, Richard. You're doing your job. Don't scare him, though,
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:27.240]  when you get up to Trump. Just say, hey, we're with them full wars. Thank you for supporting the
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:30.680]  Constitution. You know, please talk about it more because they're claiming, you know, you want to
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:35.080]  run over it. But, and I would also bring up, you know, maybe how sick Hillary looks, see what he
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:39.480]  says about that. But, but great job, Richard Reeves. All right, Alex, thank you very much.
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.640]  I appreciate you in four years out there doing business with the four store and putting the
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:48.680]  word out about it for us.com. We are in an epic battle and we are on the verge of making giant
[02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:55.240]  changes and going to victory. I love Richard Reeves. He's like that in person when he gets excited.

[02:53:08.520 --> 02:53:13.400]  unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young
[02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:18.760]  bucks and head-to-head fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns out the old guys in this unit
[02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:22.920]  had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated mountain of youth drink called
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:27.560]  Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers
[02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:32.440]  that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past. Previously,
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:37.320]  this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time the creator of

[02:53:56.520 --> 02:54:09.880]  All right my friends, I'm doing this little segment in five more minutes and then
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:17.160]  Leanne McAdoo is coming in and she's going to be covering Ron Paul's dire warning for America.
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:22.200]  Congress is writing to president a blank check for war, the most unprecedented ever. That's what
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:26.920]  I've been covering since last Friday. Ron Paul gets it. Thank God. Stephen Hawking warns humanity,
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:31.880]  leave her before the ruling class destroys it. X-Files review, Flint update, she got back.
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:38.600]  Jakari Jackson, Michael Zimmerman, Joe Biggs and more. Jam-packed fourth hour today. Some stations
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:42.760]  are now starting to pick it up. We appreciate that and if not in full wars.com forward slash
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:50.280]  show we've brought back the fourth hour. They're going to play a bunch of clips from the X-Files
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:55.960]  opening episode. Another one airs tonight. Had record ratings as reported by Variety.
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:03.240]  But looking at this, it was smattered with lots of little short clips of the O'Malley character
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:10.520]  that's based on in full wars. In the same studio, everything. It's crazy. Same setup. I mean it's
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:16.600]  amazing. And little comments like they're coming for your guns, martial law. I mean directly out
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:24.040]  of this show. Here it is. So if you own a registered firearm, you will actually be targeted as an
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:30.840]  enemy by your own government in the likely imposition of martial law. And there you go
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:37.160]  from that studio to this one, which is they've done everywhere else. They register and then
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:41.800]  confiscate. And it's just smattered throughout the whole thing. There's some big clips coming up.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.720]  I want to go to a few calls in this segment the next. Briefly, deep cleanse has been sold out

[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:53.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Craig and then Mike and others. Go ahead, Craig. You're on the air
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:57:01.240]  from Virginia. Hey, how you doing, Alex? Good, brother. Go ahead. Hey, just want you to know
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:10.200]  that Congress is trying to pass this resolution 569 condemning violence and hateful rhetoric
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:18.040]  towards Muslims in the United States. It already has over 100 co-sponsors.
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:23.320]  Yeah, I was unaware of that. I've heard people on the news saying ban people that criticize
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:30.280]  you know, the precious Muslims. But I wasn't aware they had a resolution, which this just
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:34.120]  softens us up to then have laws like Europe where they arrest you if you criticize your
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:39.480]  daughter being raped literally. There it is. HREZ 569 condemning violence, bigotry and hateful
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:45.400]  rhetoric towards Muslims in the United States. And that is that in the House judiciary brought
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:50.520]  forward by who's that brought forward by who's the sponsor of that? A whole bunch of people.
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:53.640]  I'll have to read that for myself. What does it say?
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:58:02.360]  Just a resolution and it's basically a blatant attack on the First Amendment.
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:06.840]  This is a simple resolution in the United States Congress.
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:15.400]  It's just basically making hateful speech illegal. Well, they're always trying to pass
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:18.760]  those hate speech laws where if something hurts someone's feelings, you can be arrested.
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:23.960]  Facebook says in their new rules, disagreeing with someone's grounds for hate and you can
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:27.000]  be banned. People say, well, why are you on Facebook? Well, I mean, while it's there,
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.880]  while the getting's good, we're going to go into the enemy operation and
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:35.400]  fight 360. We're completely surrounded. The Marine Corps general said, good,
[02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:39.640]  we can attack in all directions. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:43.160]  You don't have to target our howlers. We just fire in all directions. You can't miss.

[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:46.680]  All right, let's go back to the callers next longest whole
[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:52.120]  thing would be Mike in California. Mike, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:06.680]  Just pick the phone up real quick. Can you hear me now? Yeah, go ahead.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:12.760]  The National Defense Authorization Act corporate personhood and the Patriot Act.
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:16.440]  These three laws are the biggest threat to our freedom and humanity right now.
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:20.760]  Yeah, we're under martial law. They've dismantled the Constitution on paper. Now they want to
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:24.920]  actually physically do it. But it's like Bank of America started announcing in owned houses
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:29.960]  they never had the deeds for that were 100% paid for. And finally, judges just set arrest
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:34.680]  the bankers. In Florida, they had to back off. So they can announce where their slaves all day
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:38.600]  long. Let's see them try to enforce it. But that comes up to us to start saying no.
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:44.920]  I agree. And my question is, so don't we have to demand our constitutional rights back first?
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:49.560]  Yeah, and we got governors. We got governors that are moving to start a con con and governors saying
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:53.960]  we're not turning the guns in and hundreds of sheriffs and police chiefs saying we're not
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:58.440]  turning the guns in and we're prepared to fight. We're already gotten to Lexington and Concord
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:02.920]  level with the police. That's why they want to try to black lives matter war on the police
[03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:07.400]  to force them on their flank into the federal control because they got a bunch of police chiefs
[03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:13.000]  around the country, even Democrat ones that are really sleeper cell patriots in a good way that
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:17.560]  aren't going to go along. So see, I mean, this is a real battle folks for the country right now.
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:23.160]  So my question to you is if we're going to support Donald Trump, don't we need some kind of
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:27.400]  assurance from him that he'll overturn his laws because I haven't heard him. I totally agree.
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:31.000]  And next time I have him on, which will probably pretty soon, I'm going to bring up
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:35.800]  these executive actions because, you know, the president obviously needs the support of the
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:39.960]  Congress and the people and I'm sure he would want to go get military authorizations and wouldn't
[03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:45.240]  want it to be just open ended because that's not in the Constitution. And I believe that is a litmus
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:49.000]  test for Donald Trump. That's a great point. In fact, I said that earlier. I agree with you.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:52.600]  I love your product, by the way. Thank you very much.
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:56.120]  Thank you, brother. You're awesome. I just get really excited about these topics if I start
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:03.400]  running over folks. Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Colorado and we'll try to get to the
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:06.920]  other callers when the guests come up, Hector and Craig and Ron. Go ahead, Steve.
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:13.320]  Hey, Alex. Good to finally speak to you for the first time in my life. I've been following you
[03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:19.240]  since you're back and forth between you and Piers Morgan back in, I don't know, was it
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:24.760]  early 2013 or something? Yep. Anyway, yeah, I've been listening to you ever since. There's something
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:29.720]  I wanted to bring up to you, particularly with regard to gun control and this loophole they're
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:36.920]  trying to exploit with mental health. I myself am a United States Marine Corps combat infantry
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:42.680]  veteran. I was a scout for four years and I got out in 09. I'm in the process right now actually
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:48.600]  being recruited by a private military corporation, one of the bigger ones. And I wanted to, I have
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:53.240]  in my hand my PTSD diagnosis that I want to read to you. I want to read a snippet of this to you.
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:04:03.320]  It was written up by a Navy Lieutenant Commander back in 2007. And this is, I find this one piece
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:09.720]  interesting because it shed some light into how far they should or shouldn't be allowed to go with
[03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:14.200]  regard to exploiting the gun control laws into the PTSD. Hold on, this is too important.
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:17.960]  Leanne and the folks are in the situation room. I'm in the war room. We're going to come back.
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:23.960]  Have you finished up? Go over this PTSD diagnosis and then I will hand the baton at about 10 after,
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:28.440]  12 after or so to the other crew. They've got a lot to cover and a lot to get to. But don't hang up
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:35.480]  Stephen in Colorado because this is really important. It's extrajudicial. There's no judge.
[03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:42.280]  There's no jury. There's no finding. They just say basically any combat vet, you have PTSD,
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:49.400]  you're mentally ill. And then they basically won't let you own guns. They basically take your
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:53.560]  rights away like you're a criminal. It's part of targeting the veterans. Statistically,
[03:04:53.560 --> 03:05:00.600]  vets are not more dangerous than anybody else. Russia and Turkey are headed for a military
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:05.640]  confrontation along Syria's border with Turkey as reported by Kurt Nemo of info wars.com.
[03:05:05.640 --> 03:05:10.360]  According to intelligence sources in the United States, Russia has dispatched engineers to the
[03:05:10.360 --> 03:05:14.760]  northeastern city of Kualmushi on the border. The Kualmushi International Airport has already
[03:05:14.760 --> 03:05:19.480]  been closed to civilian air traffic and turned over to the Syrian military in the late October.
[03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:24.440]  Around 200 Russian personnel will fortify the airfield in Kualmushi and ready it for military
[03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:29.480]  aircraft according to the London based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Turkish media also
[03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:34.520]  reported the presence of Russian engineers and around 30 miles away. U.S. military personnel
[03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:38.680]  have established a secret air base and are building another one at a former agricultural
[03:05:38.680 --> 03:05:43.800]  airfield a few miles from the Iraqi and Turkish borders, according to Syrian activists. The Turkish
[03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:48.280]  government claims it's stepping up maneuvers against the Islamic State. Those previously reported
[03:05:48.280 --> 03:05:53.000]  that Turkey has been buying up stolen Syrian oil from ISIS for at least several months.
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:09.480]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for info wars.com.
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:37.080]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum
[03:06:37.080 --> 03:06:42.360]  potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:47.000]  but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:52.360]  goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it. Visit info wars at life.com today

[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:40.440]  out there for four years, got out and he has this PTSD diagnosis now sitting in front of him
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:44.920]  and that ties into him looking at a contractor job. So go ahead and read it to us sir and fill
[03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:49.880]  us in on it. All right I just want to make clear I wasn't force recon but I was with a
[03:08:49.880 --> 03:08:53.640]  mechanized reconnaissance unit. So I get all those confused I was just trying to repeat what
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:57.320]  you said in the memory but go ahead. No worries, no worries you're more familiar than most.
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:03.160]  So again I have this diagnosis here because I had to watch four of my friends burn to death
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:09.560]  at a vehicle in the Alambar province particularly Raul and Iraq and when I was issued this I'm
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:15.240]  going to go ahead and read the very last basically two to three sentences here. He has not sought
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:20.200]  treatment because of his concern about being labeled as weak or defective however his suicidal
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:24.760]  homicidal or urges are frightening to him and he wanted to get help before he acted on these
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:32.840]  ego dystonic urges. He does not appear to constitute a serious risk of suicide or homicide
[03:09:32.840 --> 03:09:37.720]  at this point in time and he is thus fit for retention in the SMC. Now what I find strange
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:43.240]  about this is that this by all accounts you know I have a and you know the way they write up these
[03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:47.800]  reports you know they got a axis one two three four five categorization where they straight up
[03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:52.920]  just diagnose you and I'm diagnosed with it I straight up had it I flew off the charts for
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:10:00.040]  the little test or whatever but the very last sentence is what's most telling here where they
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:07.240]  basically admit yeah he has PTSD but we still want to retain him he still he still fit to fight
[03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:12.680]  he's still competent enough to fight he still you know he still has his faculties about him
[03:10:12.680 --> 03:10:18.600]  is essentially what they're saying and what's concerning to me is that they can they can
[03:10:18.600 --> 03:10:25.000]  take this this loophole that Obama is trying to exploit and if they want to which I I have a funny
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:30.840]  funny suspicion that they might and that they will they can dig in and apply it to veterans
[03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:37.320]  who in a course PTSD among veterans is a wide encapsulating thing you know I mean it yeah it's
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:42.600]  over generalized it's over projected I think it's largely a Psyop but you're absolutely right look
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:47.480]  they're coming after the veterans veterans statistically have one of the lower crime rates
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:53.080]  actually but they are afraid of you during a tyrannical takeover you know they used to try to
[03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:56.200]  recruit military and the police and stuff and they still do so so they're horrible and they're
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:11:00.200]  bad we want them for the police and it's usually not even vets that do the stupid stuff it's the
[03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:05.720]  greenhorn want to be tough guy thug types that you don't want us cops from my research I appreciate
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:09.160]  your call god bless you let me just briefly comment on that and then hand the baton over
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:20.280]  I have studied PTSD I have studied history I've studied militaries I've studied spree decor I've
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:26.920]  studied how information warfare operates when veterans feel good about what they've done
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:33.800]  and know it's for a greater good PTSD is 90 plus percent lower
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:42.600]  but when you don't feel like it's a good fight and when you deep down know that there's a lot of
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:47.720]  fraud involved your body doesn't like you your subconscious doesn't like what you're doing
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:53.000]  you don't feel good about what you're doing it's called conscience and they try to project onto
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:57.160]  troops who may be skittish maybe a little paranoid may have problems right after a trauma
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:00.680]  that you're screwed up for life and that's the way it is I've had a lot of family that's been in
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:07.720]  heavy combat and when they came back from Vietnam or Latin America or the desert and Middle East
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:11.480]  you know for a few years they'd be a little skittish a little weird but after that they became
[03:12:11.480 --> 03:12:15.640]  you know great members of society and were some of the most steadfast people you could find
[03:12:15.640 --> 03:12:24.040]  and they are projecting onto people in a psi op that oh you can get medication oh you can get a
[03:12:24.040 --> 03:12:29.080]  you know disability you want to get a disability for you leave the military so let's give you one
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:35.480]  let's give you a mental disability women go in to you know to even dermatologists now and they
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:39.880]  go oh here's a doctor right next door you get a discount if you want to go on this speed or this
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:45.800]  drug you know because you know I can tell your stress these questionnaires are written so widely
[03:12:47.320 --> 03:12:51.960]  to where they can say your suicidal family it's like the suicide test for kids in high school
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:56.840]  you know are you upset do you you know have anxiety are you you know are you depressed
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:02.120]  sometimes and they take your freedom away or you know give you a designation for life off of that
[03:13:03.560 --> 03:13:09.400]  everybody's got PTSD to a certain extent that's ever been in I mean what do you think kids growing
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:12.760]  up really bad neighborhoods that have been in a couple hundred really bad fights have been through
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:18.920]  what do you think people that I mean race car drivers the incredible stress of that and the
[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:23.480]  people dying and what they see or what do you think boxers go through are football players
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:29.960]  they got worse PTSD the most combat vets I mean actually at the NFL level that's brutal I played
[03:13:29.960 --> 03:13:34.600]  high school football it was painful it took a lot of will to be able to just handle those
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:39.320]  injuries and keep playing and I mean I was not even very good at football good enough for them to
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:45.080]  start me it was horrible and and he'd run over but the point was is that
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:52.040]  it's a giant screw job it's a giant Psyop it's like telling women they're all depressed
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:56.040]  after they've had a cesarean section well of course you haven't been able to exercise for six
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:14:00.440]  weeks of course you're depressed go out and exercise in double blind studies it's way better than
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:07.080]  you know the pro's act so it's a mind game and people can take those wounds and take those pains
[03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:13.960]  and turn it into a motivation for the future and what veterans need is to go out and help others
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:20.680]  and to go out and be on a mission now for America what troops need is a continued mission
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:24.280]  that's why a lot of them from vietnam go off and run and live in the woods or whatever because they
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:29.880]  want to stay kind of in that mindset because it's what they know well we we need veterans to just
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:33.960]  realize don't buy into the fact you're a victim don't buy the fact you're screwed up take what
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:40.520]  you've gone through and actually use that to take action in the real world around you and
[03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:44.040]  they won't tell veterans this either they try to put them on pro's act how many of their drugs
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:49.960]  let's screw people up they try to put them on opiates for PTSD and things the studies are
[03:14:50.520 --> 03:14:57.720]  that MDMA ecstasy you know the real stuff look at the studies in europe with troops is amazing
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:02.200]  instead they want to give them amnesic drugs they want to give them vaccines that change
[03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:08.280]  brain chemistry and actually take the highs and lows out of your emotions watch my film brain
[03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:12.600]  eating vaccines it's a it's a 15 minute video where they're where it actually goes into each
[03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:18.600]  part of your brain see they've got real treatments for people okay where it'll just lift years of
[03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:23.480]  stress off of them but they don't want you to have access to that and i'm not saying go out and use
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:28.280]  street drugs most that stuff's horrible and really hurt the troops but you know it's like fibromyalgia
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:32.040]  being a microplasm they won't tell folks that certain antibiotics have been proven to knock it
[03:15:32.040 --> 03:15:35.640]  out they won't get the troops that either there's all sorts of things that are known that get rid
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:42.520]  of Lyme's disease you name it but they won't tell the public all right so that's the bottom line
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:46.600]  ladies and gentlemen i'm going to hand the baton now they got a lot to cover so sorry i went over
[03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:51.000]  here to leon macadoo and the rest of the crew but that was a powerful testimony earlier leon
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:57.640]  macadoo thank you alex i'm here ready to take over the overdrive hour and and it's it's you're
[03:15:57.640 --> 03:16:02.280]  absolutely right i mean the way that they take advantage of our troops and we definitely do
[03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:08.440]  have the greatest military in the world but that's it's not for them to build up our service members
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:13.880]  it's for them to go and send us off into these perpetual wars and so that's what i don't like
[03:16:13.880 --> 03:16:19.000]  is drumming up the patriotism for our troops and then sending them off to these perpetual wars
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:23.720]  so that's what jocari jackson is here joining me we're going to talk about this blank check
[03:16:23.720 --> 03:16:29.480]  that congress is writing for this president or for whoever may be the next president and this
[03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:35.400]  is why it's so important to pay attention who are we voting in there who is going to be have this
[03:16:35.400 --> 03:16:42.120]  blank check authorization to to go to war and this is going to be a global war so let's talk a little
[03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:47.880]  bit about rom paul's dire warning for america he says this legislation makes the unconstitutional
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:54.680]  iraq war authorization look like a walk in the park and of course you know as alex jones is always
[03:16:54.680 --> 03:16:59.480]  saying they tend to do these things on a friday night they're going to announce the the banks you
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:07.320]  know the banks are closed well here we have snow zilla this snow mageddon and so of course we have
[03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:13.960]  mitch mcconnell heading to the senate to pass a um basically it's going to be fast track legislation
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:20.520]  to grant the president the authority to wage unlimited war for as long as he or his successors
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:25.800]  may wish he or she may wish and that's why it frightens me so much when you hear these presidential
[03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:30.920]  candidates talking about going to war knowing that we're potentially going to be heading into war
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:37.560]  with russian troops in syria you have um conflict in syria escalating as russia and us establish
[03:17:37.560 --> 03:17:42.360]  air bases along the turkish border uh so jocari what do you think about that i mean do you think
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:47.320]  it's people should be taking this very seriously i think it's good because it's handing it over their
[03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:52.600]  power i definitely as you said uh it's basically a transfer of power as ron paul puts it from the
[03:17:52.600 --> 03:17:57.080]  legislative to the executive branch and it allows the president or whoever the president may be in
[03:17:57.080 --> 03:18:02.840]  the future to wage war without restrictions on time geographic scope or troops on the ground and
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:06.360]  the geographic scope would probably be something that i would you know i'm pretty hard they could
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:10.840]  say you know isis is you know in your in your grandma's underwear right at the uh at the airport
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:15.080]  and then they could choose to uh have a campaign there gotta be very clear about this you know my
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:20.040]  view of it is uh you know it's the potential for them to do this it's not my personal opinion that
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:24.600]  we're currently under martial law or will be in the near future of when the next president takes over
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:29.240]  i'm just saying this is a uh open-ended blank check to whoever may be in power and could
[03:18:29.240 --> 03:18:35.560]  potentially use these powers similar to uh the rex 84 legislation as we know is drafted in 1984 that
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:40.200]  stuff didn't happen uh as far as on the streets and all that but they gave themselves the authority
[03:18:40.200 --> 03:18:46.040]  to do that if they so chose right and so this legislation is is basically setting up uh giving
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:52.200]  the president whoever he or she may be authority over just about anything during a time of national
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:57.320]  crisis people were saying we need to declare national emergency so the president can confiscate
[03:18:57.320 --> 03:19:02.920]  guns i mean people are people are just throwing that that out there uh as as something that the
[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:08.680]  president could use or you know during this snowmageddon let no good crisis go to waste you
[03:19:08.680 --> 03:19:13.400]  know rama manual if you can uh the paraphrase rama manual he said in a crisis you can do
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:17.960]  something that you normally wouldn't be able to do so for any reason whether it's no beginning
[03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:21.640]  or anything else if they decide well let's just tack something else onto the end of this they
[03:19:21.640 --> 03:19:26.280]  have the potential with this legislation to do that right and of course we're seeing the destruction
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:32.360]  of europe uh with migrants destroying european labor and so of course the the an economic crisis
[03:19:32.360 --> 03:19:37.320]  could be enough to drum up the use for this authorization of military force i mean it's
[03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:41.800]  thank holiday anything they choose right there are no limits to this and that's that's why this is
[03:19:41.800 --> 03:19:47.720]  huge obviously make sure this legislation does not pass um anything they try to pass when it's a
[03:19:47.720 --> 03:19:52.120]  snowy blizzard out you just got to keep the heads up stick around i'm going to be giving you the

[03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:15.320]  and macadoo here hosting the fourth hour joining me now is michael zimmerman um michael you were
[03:24:15.320 --> 03:24:21.320]  the camera guy there with me in flint michigan and you know what was your take personally i felt
[03:24:21.320 --> 03:24:25.880]  like it was uh it could have been the fact that the whole entire city was blanketed in snow
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:32.280]  but it gave me like a very fallout four kind of vibe the whole city was super eerie because
[03:24:32.280 --> 03:24:37.000]  there's no one on the streets and that could have been because it's 20 degrees outside but it just
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:42.040]  it feels abandoned and you see they tore down i believe 11 000 houses over the past couple years
[03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:47.080]  because they're burned out they're so dilapidated that you know it truly is a ghost town you drive
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:53.080]  around and there's just empty pots everywhere right yeah and the roads were pretty horrendous
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:57.240]  and i almost got the sense like the downtown area i was kind of thinking about it trying to explain
[03:24:57.240 --> 03:25:02.680]  it to people uh the other night it sort of felt like it was a video game or the downtown area was
[03:25:02.680 --> 03:25:08.440]  almost set up like a facade like a movie set to give the illusion that everything is fine
[03:25:08.440 --> 03:25:14.120]  and then you kind of get out on the outskirts of the very tiny downtown and you see what's
[03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:20.120]  really going on yeah i mean outside the downtown it's empty and you know we saw maybe 20 people
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:26.360]  in the streets but other than that it's just completely bare right well now i'm gonna play a
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:33.320]  video now it's a furious flint mom and she was just ranting and we we didn't even actually have time
[03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:38.360]  to set up mics on these two mothers um i know you're going to be working on a longer report on
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:42.600]  flint michigan that hopefully it'll come out tomorrow but we didn't even have to have time to
[03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:47.160]  mic these women up because they were just so angry ranting and we were like just go for it
[03:25:47.160 --> 03:25:53.080]  just keep filming and one of the things that i learned that i just was stunned by was the fact
[03:25:53.080 --> 03:25:59.320]  that not only are these flint residents being charged the highest water rates in the country
[03:25:59.320 --> 03:26:03.880]  and this was one of the big reasons why they were having this whole water fight in the first place
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:08.360]  should we switch should we not we need to save money and of course trying to skirt around all
[03:26:08.360 --> 03:26:13.960]  sorts of financial issues but they're already being charged these exorbitant prices but now
[03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:18.040]  even though they know the the water has been poisoned contaminated they're still having
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:22.920]  issues with it they're still forcing residents to pay these super high prices for their water
[03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:29.560]  the lady said before she even turns her water on every month the minimum is $60 so uh do we
[03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:35.880]  have that video queued up guys let's go ahead and play that $56 before one drop of water comes
[03:26:35.880 --> 03:26:41.160]  out my tap yeah and we're paying for it we can't bathe in it we can't cook in it we can't do anything
[03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:45.880]  i lost the animal to feeding it to it you can't do anything with it the only thing you can do
[03:26:45.880 --> 03:26:52.200]  is flush your toilets and that's the god honest truth and make sure that you use cold water with
[03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:59.800]  anything in flint hot the vapors are killing us that's where the and the papers asthmatic um
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:07.560]  um my husband he has the opd i'm asthmatic well you know the hair loss i've got it people want
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:13.720]  to talk about it let's talk about it because i'm 52 years old i've hair that was down to my butt
[03:27:13.720 --> 03:27:19.160]  now i've cut in it because i gotta hide the ball spots from the water and where we gotta go where
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:25.560]  we gonna go to bathe what are we supposed to do we we can't go nowhere we have to pay for this water
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:29.320]  we've got shut off notice oh they're not gonna give you shut off notices we're not gonna do it
[03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:35.640]  in december oh yeah yeah let me tell you yeah shut me off in december all right for not a
[03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:40.200]  non-payment had to pay it or in december you know my kids would have went without christmas
[03:27:40.200 --> 03:27:45.000]  we had to pay for water that stinks you can't drink you can't smell looking at it make you
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:51.080]  choke up a little bit it's sickening that we pair hi we have the highest water race they
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:57.960]  upped our water rates three times in one year and it was like 70 percent in one year without um
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:04.760]  the people's vote on it we didn't have a say in it it went from one amount to another amount to
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:09.800]  another amount and it's like oh well i ain't using that much water oh now your water bill is this much
[03:28:10.680 --> 03:28:16.200]  you know and i have another problem with uh flint's basic um little thing and their political
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:22.200]  gain here isn't it funny that we've got this i'm gonna call it watergate because there was a
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:29.160]  break in the city files the water department and only the things that can get the people
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:34.680]  that did what they did or got the dirt on them come out missing not my bills not the meter ridden
[03:28:34.680 --> 03:28:41.160]  bills not the bills gonna be sent to the people just the information that's gonna cover their
[03:28:41.160 --> 03:28:47.240]  butts came out missing can anybody say watergate and it isn't it isn't them against us and it
[03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:53.240]  shouldn't be it should be we the damn people for once stand together united it is well i am
[03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:59.080]  just one of all of us and it takes all of us to make this miracle round go you know and that's
[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:03.720]  what makes me so angry it's like i don't want to talk i didn't want to either you know because
[03:29:03.720 --> 03:29:09.720]  i'm so angry now that sometimes biting my tongue just ain't enough and i look at my grandson and
[03:29:09.720 --> 03:29:15.720]  he's got sores and i look at the skin problems and he's um a mixed child and he has a lot of
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:21.080]  skin issues anyways with asheness and nothing's hitting it he's had little spots on his head
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:25.800]  like she said with her all right so we'll go ahead and come out of that video you can see the full
[03:29:25.800 --> 03:29:29.880]  thing at the alex jones youtube channel but as you can see these parents are furious they're
[03:29:29.880 --> 03:29:35.000]  getting charged exorbitant rates for their water and they just want answers and then of course there
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:42.360]  you had the the other cover up with the thieving of the any evidence there out of the water company
[03:29:42.360 --> 03:29:45.880]  so stick around because coming up we're going to talk about these flint residents being told
[03:29:45.880 --> 03:29:52.120]  that they're they're children can be taken away we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[03:29:52.120 --> 03:30:01.240]  jones and the gcn radio network hundreds of monkeys have been sent to australia for so called
[03:30:01.240 --> 03:30:05.880]  medical experiments that raise serious ethical concerns and potentially reveal what would happen
[03:30:05.880 --> 03:30:10.760]  if human oids are grown in a lab more than 370 primates have been part of the research over
[03:30:10.760 --> 03:30:15.960]  the past 15 years and the scientists who conduct the tests are most likely entirely lacking in
[03:30:15.960 --> 03:30:20.440]  expertise essential to care for such animals australia's royal society for the prevention
[03:30:20.440 --> 03:30:24.360]  of cruelty to animals said the experiments are extremely cruel in nature with one test
[03:30:24.360 --> 03:30:28.680]  reportedly involving a baboon who died after getting a kidney transplant from a pig the violent
[03:30:28.680 --> 03:30:33.240]  experiments were mainly conducted at the national health and medical research council baboon colony
[03:30:33.240 --> 03:30:37.640]  in western sydney millions of dollars from research grants were used to conduct the experiments
[03:30:37.640 --> 03:30:41.480]  in hospitals connected with studies refuse to disclose the details about the number of
[03:30:41.480 --> 03:30:46.280]  primates which have been experimented on or how many had died or had been killed now hypothetically
[03:30:46.280 --> 03:30:51.160]  if these same scientists were to grow human oids in a lab by combining human dna with who knows
[03:30:51.160 --> 03:30:55.160]  what else do you really think they would treat them any different now think about that and this
[03:30:55.160 --> 03:31:01.000]  is kit daniels reporting for info wars dot com used since before the days of the roman empire to

[03:33:19.800 --> 03:33:31.000]  of the info war welcome back to the alex jones show i'm hosting the fourth hour overdrive on
[03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:36.760]  the immaculate joined by michael zinerman and joe bigs now before the break we watched a video of
[03:33:36.760 --> 03:33:42.600]  a furious flint mother speaking out about the fact you saw there's a hair loss when you think hair
[03:33:42.600 --> 03:33:48.440]  loss from this blood poisoning maybe you're thinking thinning hair no she right there on camera
[03:33:48.440 --> 03:33:53.160]  laid it out there she's like this is what we're talking about when we talk about hair loss
[03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:59.000]  and rashes and there was this concentrated cover-up women mothers were getting turned away
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:04.200]  when they tried to go bring video to the doctors there was a mother who actually took a video of
[03:34:04.200 --> 03:34:10.280]  her child getting a rash from taking a bath and initially the doctor was very concerned then of
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:14.920]  course he got a little heat from the city they had to shut that down so here you're seeing in flint
[03:34:14.920 --> 03:34:22.360]  just a concentrated effort to hide these people's concerns and now here's a story out of activist
[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:27.800]  posts flint residents told that their children could be taken away if they don't pay for the city's
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:35.000]  poisoned water now there has been a class action lawsuit filed from some flint residents who say
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:40.120]  we don't want to pay our water bills it's been poisoned we've been having to pay to poison our
[03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:47.560]  children since 2014 well there's a michigan law parents are neglectful if they do not have running
[03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:53.080]  water in their home and if they choose not to pay for water they can't drink anyway then they could
[03:34:53.080 --> 03:34:59.240]  be guilty of child endangerment and it's already the third third the nation's third most dangerous
[03:34:59.240 --> 03:35:05.640]  city right now you add that lack of water what is that going to do to flint over time that's going
[03:35:05.640 --> 03:35:10.200]  to make things even worse yeah and the fact that it's lead poisoning and side effects from lead
[03:35:10.200 --> 03:35:15.240]  make people more aggressive more violent it leads to um i mean i i feel bad for those people i mean
[03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:18.600]  that is horrible what is going on it is really horrible and the fact that the government is
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:23.080]  forcing them to be hooked up to the municipal water supply this was another thing that you'll
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:28.120]  see in another video we've got coming out they're not allowed they will have their house condemned
[03:35:28.120 --> 03:35:33.560]  if they try to go do it the old way and and collect rainwater or figure out and obviously you'd
[03:35:33.560 --> 03:35:38.360]  have to dig really really deeply to get a well deep enough to get past all that contamination
[03:35:38.360 --> 03:35:43.400]  from the auto industry but i mean they don't have any other option even if you could you know dig a
[03:35:43.400 --> 03:35:47.880]  well like you were saying it's illegal in flint city limits to do so right and they're and they're
[03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:52.280]  telling these people will take your kids will condemn your home we know the water is poisoned
[03:35:52.280 --> 03:35:56.440]  and that was one of the things that that lady mentioned she didn't want to speak out because
[03:35:56.440 --> 03:36:00.600]  they then say oh well you're going to go ahead and need to pay your water bill this month i know
[03:36:00.600 --> 03:36:05.560]  it's four hundred dollars so i mean it's just extortion and and they were telling us the people
[03:36:05.560 --> 03:36:09.800]  there in flint that you know they were told you're not going to have your water shut off for non-payment
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:14.760]  until we get this whole thing figured out with the you know poisoned water but she showed us a
[03:36:14.760 --> 03:36:19.320]  shut off notice from december right we're going to shut off your water in the middle of the most
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:23.240]  freezing cold month i mean not that you can take hot showers anyway she explained that they have to
[03:36:23.240 --> 03:36:27.800]  bathe by dumping bottled water on their head and then getting soaked up and then another bottled
[03:36:27.800 --> 03:36:32.920]  water to clean i mean can you imagine living in those conditions and then i i saw over the weekend
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:37.720]  there was some social justice warriors on twitter they were like oh they're making people show i d
[03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:42.840]  in order to get these cases of water but people don't understand that there are people that are
[03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:48.760]  stealing the water and trying to sell it people are coming in from other places where they're
[03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:53.000]  not even dealing with this trying to steal these cases of water so you have to prove that you're
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:58.440]  a resident there i mean it's just kind of crazy but you know what it's just a huge government
[03:36:58.440 --> 03:37:02.840]  conspiracy nobody believes that the government would poison you nobody believes that they would
[03:37:02.840 --> 03:37:07.400]  do this even though now we have proof that they were joking about residents complaining about
[03:37:07.400 --> 03:37:11.800]  it this was going on since at least 2014 the people we spoke with said that they've been
[03:37:11.800 --> 03:37:16.760]  complaining about this water for up to five years uh which is some of the dirtiness there
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:21.080]  meanwhile if we poison something we're going to get fined for it you got oil spills in the gulf
[03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:26.120]  you got the epa dumping poison into rivers no one cares about that that's fine we'll let them off
[03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:30.920]  the hook let's go after you know mr and mrs flint right here is trying to take care of their family
[03:37:30.920 --> 03:37:34.760]  and find them for not paying their bill because they don't want to drink poison right and sorry
[03:37:34.760 --> 03:37:38.680]  the economy is so bad but we're going to go ahead and charge you some of the most exorbitant
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:43.720]  water rates in the country i mean the sense that i got you know obviously you're there the people
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:50.440]  that we met were all really nice passionate people and um you know it's sad to say it's time to move
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:54.760]  out but you can kind of see that there is a concentrated effort there to try and turn it
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:59.960]  into green space because it's so contaminated there everything the ground is poison you know
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:04.920]  the local was telling us that where the uh old factories where they couldn't even you know build
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:09.560]  a park there they had to put dirt on top of the concrete because if they just dug up the concrete
[03:38:09.560 --> 03:38:13.640]  there would be so much ground pollution that nothing would grow so they had to bring in
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:18.600]  dirt on top of the concrete to even build a park right and it's like i you know i feel bad
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:22.680]  to talk about flint michigan like that because like i said there were some people there that are
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:28.040]  pretty cool and you know young business owner trying to make the best of it but it is it's
[03:38:28.040 --> 03:38:33.400]  it's like you it might be the damages done it's pretty poisonous there it's you know but like i
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:38.200]  said a lot of people don't have the means to move out so now while we're on a government conspiracy
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:44.440]  theories let's go ahead and talk about the x-files um the first episode premiered last night um i
[03:38:44.440 --> 03:38:49.000]  haven't gotten a chance to watch it but of course i've been seeing the um some of the articles
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:54.120]  coming out today of course attacking alex jones how can you take him seriously why would you give him
[03:38:54.120 --> 03:39:00.040]  a set up like this basically there being um dana scully's character how she is you know really
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:06.840]  needing this is a treason and it's all just clap trap well the interesting thing is is i knew that
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:10.520]  this episode was going to get a lot of attention you know it was what like a week two weeks ago
[03:39:10.520 --> 03:39:15.560]  that came out saying that the this new character being brought in or introduced into the x-files
[03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:20.360]  you know team with scully and molder was going to be a guy based off of alex jones i knew that
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:25.320]  right there was going to get the the left so upset that you're going to have all these riders out
[03:39:25.320 --> 03:39:31.000]  there sitting there watching taking very meticulous notes just waiting to come out and sure enough
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:36.200]  you know there's tons of articles out today about that first episode but the interesting thing about
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:41.400]  this is 13.5 million people watched the x-files last night higher than the season one average
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:46.760]  well so i you know it's only going to be six episodes but it's definitely going to be
[03:39:47.400 --> 03:39:53.000]  interesting to see how it unfolds especially with this new character tato malley who uh you know
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:58.040]  as this talk this conservative talk show host you know when when the first episode comes on
[03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:02.760]  you know uh molder is kind of like apprehensive of tato malley and then towards the end of the
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:08.040]  episode he compares him to a godsend saying that he's you know the greatest thing ever so it's
[03:40:08.040 --> 03:40:11.640]  really interesting to see where they've gone with this season and if you guys want you know did you
[03:40:11.640 --> 03:40:17.160]  watch it not yet definitely so basically what happens is you have fox and molder they're sitting
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:23.880]  there or scully and molder and they're brought back into together to work together because
[03:40:23.880 --> 03:40:31.320]  this tato malley guy has reached out to the fbi and basically shows them some information that
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:36.200]  everything they've done in the past and previous episodes was all a lie now they were kind of close
[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:41.960]  to what was going on but they weren't really right on the the right path now and the previous seasons
[03:40:41.960 --> 03:40:46.200]  they're going after ufo phenomena they're chasing for the fact that they believe that the government's
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:52.760]  trying to cover up uh you know intelligent life uh aliens things like that but come to find out what
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:57.480]  this season is is that no not in fact that they weren't trying to cover up the existence of uh
[03:40:57.480 --> 03:41:03.320]  alien technology what they were doing is is they took alien technology from area 51 crash
[03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:09.240]  and they harness it and in fact the government is using that technology to go against the people
[03:41:09.240 --> 03:41:14.680]  now it wasn't uh you know et running around in the spacecraft picking up and abducting people no
[03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:19.080]  that was the government because there's a character that they bring back from the original seasons
[03:41:19.080 --> 03:41:25.240]  and she had been abducted more than anyone and he uh molder goes what did the aliens look like
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:29.880]  and she goes they look like people they look like men right and you know tata mali brings them into
[03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:35.720]  this area and shows that they have this actual ufo and they have the technology they've harnessed
[03:41:35.720 --> 03:41:40.280]  it can levitate it can disappear right and all this stuff and the government is using that against
[03:41:40.280 --> 03:41:43.880]  its own people absolutely and i know that that's kind of something that's been floating around
[03:41:43.880 --> 03:41:47.960]  on the internet for a long time saying that they've harnessed this alien technology and of course
[03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:55.000]  why wouldn't they and to just see how technology advanced since the roswell crash and everything
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:02.040]  um also interesting the uh one of the reviews here we are all alex jones from the work print
[03:42:02.040 --> 03:42:07.880]  kind of interesting to talking about how when x files first came out the internet was nobody had
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:16.360]  computers essentially so now alex jones is kind of the the new agents scully and molder and the
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:21.560]  rest of us out there on the internet who are able to post these videos uh to youtube and things like
[03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:28.200]  that and to put these other theories out there other than what is being um perpetuated by the
[03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:33.320]  government and by the mainstream media and it's kind of interesting to see now with this x files
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:38.760]  kind of pushing back against that as well um just we're all we're all alex jones everyone needs to
[03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:44.840]  do their part in yeah exposing things if you see something film it and absolutely and stop for goodness
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:50.760]  sake stop posting the videos on youtube with the fake alien invasions and like using after effects
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:54.840]  to be like oh what's this sound effect because it does just discredit anything that could actually
[03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:58.920]  be you have to kind of sift through all of the nonsense uh well let's go ahead and play this
[03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:05.240]  clip because when i first watched uh the clip where um oh sorry i've lost my video thing the
[03:43:05.240 --> 03:43:11.640]  blueprint for global domination it is literally like they just listen to an alex jones show and
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:19.960]  copied it verbatim let's go ahead and roll driven not only by corporate greed but a darker objective
[03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:25.720]  the takeover of america and then the world itself by any means necessary however violent
[03:43:26.360 --> 03:43:33.240]  or cruel or efficient by severe drought brought on by weather wars conducted secretly using aerial
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:40.280]  contaminants and high altitude electromagnetic waves in a state of perpetual war to create problem
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:46.360]  reaction solution scenarios to distract enrage and enslave american citizens at home with tools
[03:43:46.360 --> 03:43:51.240]  like the patriot act and the national defense authorization act which abridged the constitution
[03:43:51.240 --> 03:43:57.400]  in the name of national security the militarization of police forces in cities across the u.s the
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:02.600]  building of prison camps by the federal emergency management agency with no stated purpose the
[03:44:02.600 --> 03:44:07.320]  corporate takeover of food and agriculture pharmaceuticals and health care even the military
[03:44:07.320 --> 03:44:13.480]  in clandestine agendas to fat and dull sicken and control of populace already consumed by consumerism
[03:44:13.480 --> 03:44:18.120]  and i encourage you all to go shopping more a government that taps your phone collects your
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:23.720]  data and monitors your whereabouts with impunity a government preparing to use that data against you
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:31.480]  when it strikes and the final takeover begins the takeover of america by a well-oiled and well
[03:44:31.480 --> 03:44:38.360]  armed multinational group of elites that will call kill and subjugate happening as we sit here it's
[03:44:38.360 --> 03:44:43.880]  happening all around us the other shoe waiting to drop it'll probably start on a friday the banks
[03:44:43.880 --> 03:44:49.480]  will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend digital money
[03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:54.680]  will disappear they can just seal your money followed by the detonation of strategic electromagnetic
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:59.560]  pulse bombs to knock out major grids well we'll seem like an attack on america by terrorists or
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:05.080]  russia or a simulated alien invasion using alien replica vehicles that exist and are already in
[03:45:05.080 --> 03:45:13.960]  use an alien invasion of the u.s the russians tried it in 47 you can't say these things i'm gonna
[03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:23.960]  say them tomorrow it's fear mongering claptrap isolation is techno paranoia so bogus and dangerous
[03:45:23.960 --> 03:45:31.240]  and stupid what does that mean saying these things would be incredibly irresponsible
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:38.040]  it's irresponsible not to say it especially if it's the truth and there you go and that's
[03:45:38.040 --> 03:45:42.600]  what alex is always saying that if it's the truth we've got to put it out there and obviously you
[03:45:42.600 --> 03:45:48.600]  don't have all the facts for everything but to just wait wait until then and and allow the message
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:54.760]  to be controlled that's definitely very dangerous especially as we see all of these plans sort of
[03:45:54.760 --> 03:46:01.400]  escalating here in these days so joe bigs now i know this wasn't really your thing conspiracies and
[03:46:01.400 --> 03:46:06.840]  stuff before coming here to info wars so when you watched the show last night what did you think
[03:46:07.640 --> 03:46:11.880]  i thought it was pretty cool i mean i liked it i know some people didn't i thought it was
[03:46:11.880 --> 03:46:17.720]  interesting to see what it is that you know we do here and i was kind of curious to see how
[03:46:18.440 --> 03:46:23.240]  closely they followed alex jones and how closely they were going to mimic this character
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:27.960]  or base off of him the way he spoke the way he said things i thought a lot of things were pretty
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:32.520]  spot on i'm just interested to see how they go with the character throughout the rest of this
[03:46:33.160 --> 03:46:37.160]  mini series you know is it going to be are they going to take him seriously or they are
[03:46:37.160 --> 03:46:41.160]  going to kind of demonize him towards the end so i'm curious to see how they're going to
[03:46:41.160 --> 03:46:46.520]  you know treat him this this character the entire time but uh you know i liked it you know i used
[03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:51.160]  to watch a show when i was a child with my mom that was our go-to show we sat down in a room
[03:46:51.160 --> 03:46:55.400]  every time that uh x-files came on and watched and i didn't really quite get any of it because
[03:46:55.400 --> 03:46:59.960]  i was really young but now i'm starting to see i started going back now and rewatching all the
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:06.920]  series again and watching this as well so i like it i enjoy it right and i i know one of the articles
[03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:12.520]  i read they were like well why does he have this alien technology this uh tad omali why doesn't he
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:17.080]  alert the mainstream media right away hello i mean the same thing that we have to deal with
[03:47:17.080 --> 03:47:22.600]  they wouldn't believe you or they would allegedly this happen even though they're like i'm standing
[03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:28.920]  in front of an alleged alien technology so i'll try to make you sound crazy yeah they'll just perfect
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:34.280]  sound bites with everything um even here with edward snowden now we we have this story up on
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:40.600]  info wars dot com about snowden questioning the latest islamic state video um the video was put
[03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:45.480]  online by the usual suspects site intelligence and he's wondering if this is uh you know if
[03:47:45.480 --> 03:47:51.960]  does the islamic state have some interest in restricting uh encryption on the internet or
[03:47:52.680 --> 03:47:57.480]  does the fbi like who's really behind this so you see these well they they want to get this
[03:47:57.480 --> 03:48:02.520]  narrative that you know if we don't ban encryption or don't break encryption and put back doors in
[03:48:02.520 --> 03:48:06.600]  it for government the terrorists are going to use that against us you know they want us to be afraid
[03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:11.240]  of encryption when in fact it's a good thing to have it it also keeps government from snooping on
[03:48:11.240 --> 03:48:18.680]  you yeah well i guess we will stay tuned into the x files as more of these episodes come out and
[03:48:18.680 --> 03:48:23.960]  sort of break them down um well x files uh actually jillian anderson uh she's one of the main character
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:30.440]  she came out and uh gave a little uh reason as to why x files ended and i kind of wanted to read
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:35.320]  that if you guys uh so she says uh the x files ended during the bush administration and we learned
[03:48:35.320 --> 03:48:40.120]  very very quickly after 9 11 the people couldn't speak up openly in public about what they thought
[03:48:40.120 --> 03:48:46.520]  we should do or shouldn't do as a result most of our show up until that point was and still is about
[03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:51.320]  government conspiracies their conspiracies now about the government having known about or having
[03:48:51.320 --> 03:48:58.440]  caused 9 11 or about it being a ruse and excuse for us to go into iraq but it became no longer okay
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:03.880]  for people to accuse the government of being deceitful or untrustworthy and that was the backbone
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:09.880]  of our show and we couldn't continue and that is why they stopped filming the x files wow and that
[03:49:09.880 --> 03:49:15.400]  is incredible and of course they sort of opened the x files with this this was starting from 9 11
[03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:19.880]  and you know that is an incredible right there because that's one of the big freedoms we have
[03:49:19.880 --> 03:49:23.560]  here in the united states with the freedom of speech is being able to question our government
[03:49:23.560 --> 03:49:29.640]  and being able to speak out and now we see how it's just a complete 180 where we have all these
[03:49:29.640 --> 03:49:34.840]  kids who've been programmed in uh indoctrinated in school basically calling for the end of the
[03:49:34.840 --> 03:49:39.480]  first amendment if it hurts their feelings i mean they want to scare people from talking about things
[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:44.680]  or they want to demonize reporters for going and reporting on something and then automatically
[03:49:44.680 --> 03:49:49.160]  saying that they're invested in that thing that they're reporting and i mean for information
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:55.080]  while i was on vacation last week uh rob rob do sent me an article from the adl anti defamation
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:50:00.840]  league basically saying that i kind of took over the malhere national wildlife refuge with amon
[03:50:00.840 --> 03:50:05.960]  bundy and i was currently living in oregon and that i was one of the the main people behind it
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:12.200]  because i reported on it now think about that me as a reporter i went to a location i talked about
[03:50:12.200 --> 03:50:17.560]  something and now i'm a part of that because i reported on it right and that you were actually
[03:50:17.560 --> 03:50:21.960]  in vegas at the time yes still hold up there yeah they basically called you a domestic terrorist
[03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:27.000]  too didn't they oh yeah i mean the adl is the exact same thing as the splc right same website
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:32.520]  layout same everything well you have been an icis terrorist video i mean but that that's really a
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:36.120]  scary thing that's happening right now that as a reporter you could go and talk about something
[03:50:36.120 --> 03:50:41.160]  and then be associated with it just for talking about it right and if you're actually doing your
[03:50:41.160 --> 03:50:46.360]  job as an investigative journalist or as an investigator you should be questioning the
[03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:54.120]  white house talking points i mean that's that's your job well uh stick around because we are gonna
[03:50:54.120 --> 03:50:57.720]  you guys i want you to stick in here with me and then david night will be letting me know

[03:54:05.640 --> 03:54:09.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show we are wrapping up the fourth hour overdrive and right
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:15.080]  before the break we were talking about this term conspiracy theorists and how you know if you're
[03:54:15.080 --> 03:54:19.080]  doing your job as a journalist you should be questioning the government and of course we
[03:54:19.080 --> 03:54:24.120]  saw that sort of wiped off the map after 9 11 no one was allowed to speak up about it one of my
[03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:29.640]  professors there at ut the press he was one of the only people that spoke out about it and got a
[03:54:29.640 --> 03:54:36.040]  lot of flak for it but he was tenured so he didn't get fired but he's he was called a festering
[03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:41.560]  fountain of foolishness by the president that was his big claim to fame but let's look at so this
[03:54:41.560 --> 03:54:48.200]  was a zero hedge article that came out last year in 1967 the CIA created the label conspiracy
[03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:54.280]  theorists to attack anyone who challenges the official narrative and this article goes on to
[03:54:54.280 --> 03:55:00.520]  explain how democracy free market capitalism were founded on conspiracy theories but those were you
[03:55:00.520 --> 03:55:06.360]  know that was a long time ago things changed in the 60s when the CIA wrote a dispatch which coined
[03:55:06.360 --> 03:55:11.880]  the term conspiracy theories and recommended methods for discrediting such theories so they
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:15.560]  can't have anyone questioning the government questioning the official narrative there we don't
[03:55:15.560 --> 03:55:20.200]  need that and of course now with the the repeal of the smith month act now they can propagate
[03:55:20.200 --> 03:55:24.360]  immediately just right to the public i mean with that definition in itself i mean people
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:28.840]  should take that as a badge of honor exactly to be called that at times i mean especially if you're
[03:55:28.840 --> 03:55:33.160]  actually doing work and you're looking at the information and you're putting it out there the
[03:55:33.160 --> 03:55:37.560]  correct way you know with the government coming out and saying that we're going after people who
[03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:41.720]  are talking about us and maybe you know might put some things out there they could get us in trouble
[03:55:42.680 --> 03:55:46.600]  and then we're being called conspiracy theorists and you know hey we're doing something right here
[03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:51.160]  so hey bring it on call me that all day and all your articles doesn't bother me right well when i
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:56.680]  was uh going through college one of my professors in our international relations professor he was
[03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:01.960]  actually one that first showed me one of alex jones's 9-11 documentaries and his whole thing was
[03:56:01.960 --> 03:56:06.840]  basically like if you really want to get into international relations and journalism you need
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:12.840]  to know what you're getting into and just kind of blowing up my mind as a young student there
[03:56:12.840 --> 03:56:17.800]  just sort of like wow this is the kind of thing and i think was it the fog of war something came
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:23.320]  out where he said after the fact well yeah we did all this stuff to get things done you know but
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:29.640]  we're conspiracy theorists so and that's what he also said is it's it's not a conspiracy theory if
[03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:35.800]  it's actually conspiracy fact some things are actual conspiracies and a lot of the things that
[03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:42.680]  you know we have the audacity to say here do end up being true indeed well tonight for the info
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:48.440]  wars nightly news david knight says he wants to talk about bloomberg considering throwing his hat
[03:56:48.440 --> 03:56:54.120]  in the ring um considering running as an independent i guess it's too late to go run as a democrat so
[03:56:54.120 --> 03:56:58.440]  what it's going to be the battle of the billionaires i guarantee as soon as he makes that announcement
[03:56:58.440 --> 03:57:02.680]  in march gun cells are going to go through the roof oh yeah i mean what is he going to do what
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:06.120]  is what is bloomberg synonymous with taking the gun so everyone's going to go in there
[03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:09.880]  he's going to be buying guns i mean he thinks he's going to hurt that all he's going to do
[03:57:09.880 --> 03:57:14.920]  is help out the gun industry and tax all the giant sodas so there won't be any salt on tables
[03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:22.200]  in restaurants no giant sodas they're 711 they'd be like demolition man a little tiny food the taco
[03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:29.400]  bell the miniature things are so uh there's just be water yeah so that i mean this is basically what
[03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:34.120]  is the criteria for running as an independent and is this the establishment trying to just
[03:57:34.120 --> 03:57:39.160]  go against bernie sanders or you know if he ends up being their democratic candidate because as we
[03:57:39.160 --> 03:57:44.840]  see hillary is just tanking and i think her lies and her crimes are going to catch up with her
[03:57:44.840 --> 03:57:50.120]  you can only have so much stuff the media just try to cover up try to deflect before the voters
[03:57:50.120 --> 03:57:55.640]  are finally going to go you know what maybe she isn't the best candidate who is actually going to
[03:57:55.640 --> 03:58:02.760]  vote for bloomberg i mean look at his record look what he did there like he's he's just a billionaire
[03:58:02.760 --> 03:58:08.440]  who wants to take your guns but he wants all of his security to be heavily armed he's the only
[03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:13.560]  one that's you know important enough to be able to protect himself and his family so yeah i agree
[03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:18.040]  with you gun sales are going to go through the roof while joe biggs michael zimmerman thank you
