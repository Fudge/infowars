[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:25.000 --> 00:33.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 00:44.000]  Everything we have said, everything that we have warned of is absolutely being confirmed right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44.000 --> 01:04.000]  The man Han showing the deep state coup, Adam Schiff, the head of the Intelligence Committee, has openly bragged that this is an intelligence agency coup against President Trump and the American people and our populist rebellion against their globalist tyranny.
[01:04.000 --> 01:23.000]  He has now announced the plan, we're going to cover it, right now, to remove President Trump during the Senate by invoking new false charges in the House and trying to create a national crisis.
[01:23.000 --> 01:40.000]  Where then the Democrat members of the Supreme Court will then weigh in saying the Senate is illegitimate, again trying to invoke violence in the streets of America.
[01:40.000 --> 02:03.000]  And like clockwork, Schiff has now announced that they want to remove Pence next, claiming that he was involved in all of this illegal activity that's completely made up.
[02:03.000 --> 02:17.000]  So it's now all happening, this broke this morning, and I see the crew putting up articles from Flashback January 2019, 11 months ago.
[02:17.000 --> 02:27.000]  We're not going to show those articles here anymore. I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while, it's no big deal, because I need to get prepared for this and I'm going to go to a terminal.
[02:27.000 --> 02:43.000]  And I'm going to pull the clips from 2017, the clips from 2018, where myself and Roger Stone specifically laid out here on air exactly how they would trigger all of this.
[02:43.000 --> 02:53.000]  And it's not about saying, oh look, we were right, it's about people understanding how this has been premeditated from the beginning.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  You all heard me say it hundreds of times, you've seen dozens of detailed reports.
[03:00.000 --> 03:13.000]  We broke it all down on January 20th, 2017, the day the president was inaugurated.
[03:13.000 --> 03:27.000]  I predicted this again a few months ago and played the clips on air of Roger and I laying it all out.
[03:27.000 --> 03:45.000]  And I'm going to go live on this December 20th, 2019 Friday global broadcast. I do intend again to open the phones up and to take your phone calls.
[03:45.000 --> 03:55.000]  Mike Adams will be hosting the fourth hour today.
[03:55.000 --> 04:05.000]  I'll be here for the next three hours taking your calls and I will be here this Saturday, last Saturday, I was here.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  We were going to go live at two o'clock. We had some technical issues with Skeleton crew and so I decided to tape instead of go live.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  But it did end up airing later in the evening, a very long detailed commercial free breakdown report.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  So I'm going to go live at 2pm with all the latest developments then because they're going to make major moves the next 24 hours.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  And then I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6pm on the normal Sunday show to go over all this.
[04:36.000 --> 04:46.000]  But when we come back, I'm going to lay all this out and how they're going to make their moves and how we can counter them from every angle straight ahead.
[04:46.000 --> 04:59.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the battle for the Republic. This is America on the break. This is the Republic Awakening and fighting back.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[05:07.000 --> 05:20.000]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise world leaders.
[05:20.000 --> 05:33.000]  They do not want this story continuing and this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word to have a piece of history and to fund our operation.
[05:33.000 --> 05:44.000]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. These things don't hang themselves on the front. On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in info wars as a wreath.
[05:44.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's also a noose. The system can't stand it when you promote things to grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America, pro human media.
[05:53.000 --> 06:03.000]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[06:23.000 --> 06:43.000]  It is Friday, December 20th, 2019. I am your host Alex Jones.
[06:43.000 --> 07:06.000]  And we are in the middle of a corrupt deep state who against the election of 2016 and the attempt to overthrow the very popular patriotic president, the Maverick ahead of the 2020 election now only 318 days out.
[07:06.000 --> 07:16.000]  This is one hell of a time to be alive. Now, I had made a lot of predictions and so had Roger Stone. He can't talk.
[07:16.000 --> 07:24.000]  There's an unconstitutional gag order right now facing 20 to 52 years in prison for the crime of getting the president elected.
[07:24.000 --> 07:32.000]  They're trying to get us taken off air obviously as well. That is a badge of honor and courage, which I wear proudly, but I do want to win and stay in the game.
[07:32.000 --> 07:40.000]  Nevertheless, but I didn't expect to be targeted. Didn't expect to be this successful in the fight against tyranny, but the Lord does work in mysterious ways.
[07:40.000 --> 07:54.000]  But we told you in January of 2017, I'm going to show you those articles, those clips, everything at the end of the hour, that they would do this exact move with a fake impeachment.
[07:54.000 --> 08:04.000]  And during the impeachment, they would then start threatening everybody around the president and threatening them with impeachment if they don't move with a 25th amendment, remove the president model.
[08:04.000 --> 08:14.000]  And that's what Stone was getting from his sources. That's what he was advising the president of how the president was being illegally spied on, who was behind it, how come he was a criminal.
[08:14.000 --> 08:33.000]  All of that's been proven to be absolutely on target. That's why they were so angry at Info Wars and hysterical on every news channel, comedy show, movies, shows like Homeland, The Good Doctor, hundreds of programs, comedy central shows, hundreds of different broadcasts.
[08:33.000 --> 08:49.000]  Just on mainstream TV saying I was the devil, I was a white supremacist, I was the total liar, I believe there's Martian slave colonies, because I was having guessed on that were the smartest, most informed people period, and it was scaring the hell out of them.
[08:49.000 --> 09:04.000]  Now, the reason I say that now is not to go, oh, look, we were right about almost everything. Boy, I wish I was wrong about all this stuff. We've been dead on, except it's worse than we thought.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  I'm telling everybody this now because we're dead on.
[09:09.000 --> 09:27.000]  Now, I want to say that Trump has routed them. We've routed them. It's blown up in their face. They're totally pathetic. The polls show Trump's incredibly successful. And in the real world, that's happening with thinking people.
[09:27.000 --> 09:46.000]  But in the deep state itself, there are plans within plans. And Pelosi is illegally saying, we're not going to pass forward the Articles of Impeachment, we're just going to leave it here, as if the word impeachment means he's been convicted, not indicted.
[09:46.000 --> 10:02.000]  And we're going to bring forward, we're going to have a trial in the house, basically.
[10:02.000 --> 10:28.000]  And so let me just make the big announcements. There is an ongoing coup. What we first said is now completely confirmed. They're having a trial in the house. And they say they're going to have committees still ongoing, turning out this information and having scripted participants and witnesses bring forward all manner of stuff about his tax return
[10:28.000 --> 10:44.000]  and his business dealings and his family and more Russiagate crap. They're bringing that back out now and recycling it while holding the impeachment articles, one and two they passed back from the Senate.
[10:44.000 --> 11:00.000]  And then Pelosi said last night, I may bring forward more impeachment articles. So that's our reason to hold back. Well, the Supreme Court's clear in the Constitution and in rulings, just the last few years that we're going to go over here today, that it's a process.
[11:00.000 --> 11:14.000]  Once you vote, once you trigger, once you do it, it goes to the Senate. And courts can't come in and try to override the Senate. The House can't come in and override the Senate. That's the process. That's our rules.
[11:14.000 --> 11:27.000]  To stop attempts by the bureaucracy to become dictators, like we see them doing now, the out of control arrogant rogue government bureaucrats.
[11:27.000 --> 11:43.000]  Here we are. And that's what's happening. And so people are like, oh, they just suddenly because they're so embarrassed and people aren't supporting this in the polls, they're now holding it off. No folks, they were always planning this.
[11:43.000 --> 11:59.000]  They were always envisioning that they would bring forward the kangaroo allegations during the Senate trial itself, just in a court of public opinion, and then try to project that on pressure to the senators. That's going to happen too. But no, it became clear in the last week, they're going to continue with investigations in the House.
[11:59.000 --> 12:22.000]  And then hold the country and the Senate hostage while they tack on more disinformation and then tell the public that impeachment is conviction so that a large portion of the public so dumbed down in national polls believe the president is being removed from office and is already gone.
[12:22.000 --> 12:31.000]  Idiocracy has come to our shores. Nixon versus the United States says clearly Pelosi can't do what she's doing. We're going to go over it.
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  There's a whole compilation article in infowars.com. Idiots think impeachment means Trump no longer president. We're going to go over it. It is amazing.
[12:41.000 --> 12:57.000]  House Senate impeachment impasse would mean Trump wasn't impeached at all. Harvard law professor says yes, according to federal rulings and according to constitution, but they don't care. They're going to create the illusion he's been removed and hasn't gone and call him a dictator.
[12:57.000 --> 13:09.000]  Mark my words by next week. You'll be hearing he's a dictator that needs to leave. Then they'll put pressure under 25th amendment on the rest of his cabinet to come after them and indict them.
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.000]  Because the Justice Department won't act. Trump won't move against them. And so they're going to up and ratchet up the game towards civil war.
[13:17.000 --> 13:30.000]  Harvard law professor delaying impeachment trial is highly unconstitutional. Yeah, and letting them get away with this is a plot to make Pelosi president. Now Adam Schiff wants to go up and vice president Pence.
[13:30.000 --> 13:42.000]  And that's up on infowars.com. We told you that hundreds of times. And who becomes president if he's removed Pelosi, then who's ready to run for office.
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  Still rather Democratic Party waiting for a broker convention. Hillary Clinton Pelosi is the placeholder. She becomes the first woman president.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  But oh, it's okay. We have an election a few months later and boom. Hillary Rodham Clinton is in. It's all set up. It's all prepared.
[13:55.000 --> 14:10.000]  We told you two years ago with total precision. We're getting the clips total precision continuing how dumb down has America become here are 30 people that actually believe Trump is no longer president.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  That's just who they interviewed saying. Pelosi calls it bipartisan, even though they voted along partisan lines.
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.000]  So there you go. We're going to lay it all out. But the coup is live. They have a chance to succeed because no one's stopping their criminal activity.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  They're just escalating, escalating, escalating, normalizing tyranny. We're going to go to break. We have the biggest specials now of the year going.
[14:33.000 --> 14:41.000]  A lot of people waited till all 12 days of Christmas sales kicked in because it compounds over each day. All 12 days of Christmas are now official.

[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  Some of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.000 --> 16:27.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help? Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:33.000 --> 16:43.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.

[17:03.000 --> 17:12.000]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.000 --> 17:25.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.000 --> 17:33.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[18:14.000 --> 18:30.000]  But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns. Don't bother them.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  The globalists have sent in the clowns. They've sent in antifa. They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines. They've sent in their clowns.
[18:44.000 --> 18:50.000]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.000]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge. But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front. It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  And that's my allegor.
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this. Some people get about 8 hours.
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  But people take this. People are taking sports. People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  You can call us whatever you want. It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  TurboForce, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's like a bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[19:52.000 --> 20:01.000]  It's a win-win, 360-together, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[20:01.000 --> 20:27.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  I intend to go to your phone calls. Start of the next segment.
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  First-time callers, long-time callers. You agree, you disagree.
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  It's like disagreeing with the fact that I'm wearing a red shirt.
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  No, I am wearing a dark red shirt. The background is blue behind me.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  There is a deep state out of the open with clapper on national TV saying,
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.000]  thank God for the deep state, we're removing Trump out of the Intelligence Committee that is still having hearings,
[20:57.000 --> 21:07.000]  still producing fake information for the media, and then now the general public thinks that President Trump has been impeached.
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  That's what they think.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  So what do you do about that?
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  Well, President Trump has to come out against it and not just call it witch hunts and not just call it criminal.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  He needs to be specific in a national address.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  And info wars has written the articles that have all the details. Zero had just gotten it right.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  Many others have, but my goodness, they've had articles in Atlantic Monthly.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  They've had articles in the Washington Post. They've had articles in the New York Times.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  They'd have articles in the Council on Fine Relations.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  They've had article after article. Here's one right here for people.
[21:51.000 --> 21:58.000]  2017, deep state moles continue government plan to overthrow Trump using 25th Amendment,
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  install Pelosi, and then she would install Hillary as her vice president.
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  Then she would resign and Hillary would be president.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  Now, we told you that in 2017 in probably a hundred reports,
[22:15.000 --> 22:22.000]  you can just go to Bing, Google blocks it and type in info wars.com is the prefix to find it for viewers and listeners.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  We were searching just that.
[22:24.000 --> 22:32.000]  And then you type in 25th Amendment plan to remove Trump, install Hillary and or Pelosi.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  It brings them both up. You'll just see Roger and I dozens of videos.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  And the reason it's important is we lay out all how they'll do it.
[22:40.000 --> 22:47.000]  And then two and a half, three years later, it's happening just like we said.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  And it's it's that story that defeats them.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  How they premeditated it, how they illegally spied, how they made up the Russia gate,
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  how they use that to keep their people in place inside the government.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  To fight against Trump claiming he was a foreign asset.
[23:03.000 --> 23:11.000]  Have many people in government believe they were doing all this criminal stuff because they were countering a Russian agent.
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.000]  Well, now that's been disproven.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  So now they move on to the emoluments.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  Now they move on to quid pro quo.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  Now they belong to all this other fake stuff.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  But they're bringing Russia gate back.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  Now they're bringing rape gate back.
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  Now they're bringing because they want to discredit Trump and remove him and remove Pence and remove the two Supreme Court appointees.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  They're already saying they're illegitimate.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  This is a deep state coup against all nationalists and patriots in the government.
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  This is a purge.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  And they've announced they want to arrest us if we talk about replacement migration,
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.000]  which is an official UN policy announced again yesterday to replace Europeans with Muslims.
[23:52.000 --> 24:00.000]  But the ADO says they want you arrested if you talk about that as the UN announces it publicly.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  I'm going to cover that later.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  So this is very dangerous.
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  And we can laugh at them and go, oh, look, Trump's poll numbers are way up.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  People aren't buying it.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Yes, that's good.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  But they're threatening his supporters.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  They're threatening his backers.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  They're threatening his funders.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  They're threatening his family.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  They're threatening yours truly.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  They're going after everybody with harassment and lawsuits and death threats.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  And they're going after people's spouses.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  And because the Justice Department hasn't countered this,
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.000]  it gives these people power to act like a bunch of mafia terrorists
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  and just up the ante and say, we're not going to send the impeachments forward.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  Well, that's illegal.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  Who cares if the Supreme Court says we're going to do it?
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  Because the general public in polls up to a third believe Trump is now out of office.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  I've got the articles.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Camera people, including my crew, are going out in Austin.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  When you go to Lib Tart areas, most of the people think he's already going to have to leave.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  They're like, well, see, he's in peace.
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  He's got to go.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  Uh-huh.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  You know, now he only serves out the rest of his term.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  Or no, he'll be gone at the end of the year.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  Right?
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  They don't know their ass from the hole in the ground.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  They can't find their butt with both hands.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  And this is illegal.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  It's what happens in third world countries.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  It's going on right now.
[25:27.000 --> 25:33.000]  And Playboy magazine writers and CNN reporters and all of them are playing along with the
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  one, yeah, he's gone now.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  He's going to have to go now.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  CNN writers and people know that's not true.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  They're creating the perception.
[25:41.000 --> 25:50.000]  I told you, I took my middle daughter, the night of the impeachment, Wednesday evening
[25:50.000 --> 25:59.000]  to a big group event at a city policym where a whole bunch of schools were there doing
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  their Christmas events.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  And she'd been there about an hour before she performed backstage.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  And she said, dad, the kids were hysterical.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  They were all saying he's out of office.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  He's a criminal.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  This means he's going to jail.
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  He'll be in chains, basically.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  And I came on there that night a few hours later when it was official that they passed
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  the two articles and I said, you watch.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  That's going to be what they're going to say is that he's no longer president.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  He's been convicted, even though this is just a political indictment, because the public
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  is that ignorant about the process, because Democrats are like children.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  They're petulant.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  They're angry.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  They're dumbed down.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  They don't know what's going on.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  So we have to ask ourselves, what are we going to do to counter all of this?
[26:57.000 --> 27:05.000]  What are we going to do as the American people to get the word out and explain this giant hoax?
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  877-789-Alex, and we're going to take your call starting in the next segment.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  There's a lot of other big news, though, while we were all distracted with the impeachment,
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  as we should be.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  It's very important.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  They had hearings with the Inspector General where he just devastated their criminal activity.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  We've got compilations of that, blowdowns of that.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  Barr called out Comey and said he's a liar and that he was running the illegal investigations
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  and that he lied to Congress.
[27:38.000 --> 27:44.000]  So this shows that this is a real civil war inside the government and that Trump's really
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  making a run at them and that the way the Democrats are acting so desperate it looks
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  like Durham may actually be getting ready to refer criminal indictments.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  We haven't seen it yet and I'm not saying it holds your breath, but the Democrats going
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  for the juggler like this is probably going to precipitate Trump finally forcing people
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  to do the right thing and do their duty.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  It's so dangerous for the entire system, including parts of the power structure that are completely
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  nihilistic and insane.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  So that's the point we've reached on December 20th, 2019.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  A very historic point, a very historic moment.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  And I want to explain to people, don't be overconfident.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  Yes, this is leaning against the deep state.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  They're in trouble, but this puts them in the corner and means they're going to go for
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  broke and they're trying to have the ignorant masses out there believe the president's a
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Russian agent.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  He's been convicted.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  He has to leave office.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  And when he doesn't, anti-fun, all these Soros-funded groups are saying they're going to drive
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  him from power and now Schiff's saying drive them from power.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  25th Amendment, go after the vice president, but Pelosi and it's all now official.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  They're really trying it.
[28:56.000 --> 29:03.000]  Will they succeed?
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  Hotters, Anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.

[30:03.840 --> 30:05.640]  And here's the bottom line.
[30:05.640 --> 30:08.520]  I'm not playing around, I'm not screwing around,
[30:08.520 --> 30:10.440]  I'm not joking and neither are you.
[30:11.440 --> 30:14.240]  Info wars and this operation we built together
[30:14.240 --> 30:16.600]  has delivered for America,
[30:16.600 --> 30:18.840]  has delivered for our children and the unborn,
[30:18.840 --> 30:21.680]  has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride
[30:21.680 --> 30:26.680]  and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[30:26.760 --> 30:29.600]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[30:29.600 --> 30:30.800]  And do you hear the key word?
[30:30.800 --> 30:35.800]  What we are doing is beyond critical.
[30:36.040 --> 30:40.120]  So this is the time with the biggest sales ever
[30:40.120 --> 30:42.280]  during Christmas at info wars tour.com
[30:42.280 --> 30:44.240]  to get in there and buy these products

[30:47.360 --> 30:50.080]  to get this operation to the next level.
[30:50.080 --> 30:51.600]  I need the money.
[30:51.600 --> 30:53.840]  I need to be able to fight the globalist.

[31:00.440 --> 31:02.880]  I've got a problem that I wanna confess
[31:02.880 --> 31:04.240]  to the listeners and viewers.
[31:05.280 --> 31:07.240]  I've been on the air so long
[31:07.240 --> 31:08.680]  that I take it for granted now
[31:08.680 --> 31:11.320]  when we break some massive story
[31:11.320 --> 31:13.640]  that changes the whole world.
[31:13.640 --> 31:15.840]  And that really does great things
[31:15.840 --> 31:17.560]  for the future of not just our children
[31:17.560 --> 31:19.320]  but our children's children.
[31:19.320 --> 31:21.760]  Info wars really has changed history.
[31:21.760 --> 31:24.440]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners
[31:24.440 --> 31:26.160]  because I know you're a lot like me
[31:26.160 --> 31:29.560]  to really think about a world without info wars.
[31:29.560 --> 31:30.920]  Because I can tell you right now
[31:30.920 --> 31:33.240]  if people don't really step to the plate
[31:33.240 --> 31:35.840]  and really financially support our broadcast
[31:35.840 --> 31:39.640]  going into 2020, we're not gonna be on the air in a year or so.
[31:39.640 --> 31:43.160]  If you do support us, we're not just gonna stay on the air
[31:43.160 --> 31:45.720]  but we are going to expand in ways
[31:45.720 --> 31:47.480]  that are gonna blow you away.

[33:09.600 --> 33:13.400]  Come on in.
[33:11.160 --> 33:13.400]  Now it's On A Jam.
[33:13.360 --> 33:14.520]  Now it's Forced lasso.
[33:23.760 --> 33:24.600]  I've got a siesta.
[33:24.600 --> 33:28.200]  So, now we hear the eight counting and pre-am instead of
[33:28.200 --> 33:29.480]  it not together.
[33:32.760 --> 33:35.120]  What's going on in CCTV TV right now?
[33:35.120 --> 33:55.120]  Thinking specifically about a letter that you spent to the Vice President's office this week in which you raised questions as to what the Vice President knew about the President's behavior, the President's scheme in Ukraine, and thereby essentially his potential involvement in any cover-up of that behavior by the President.
[33:55.120 --> 34:12.120]  Are you actively looking at Vice President Mike Pence and his role in this scandal? And should we expect further revelations either related to the Vice President or related to the other core parts of these allegations that have resulted in this impeachment tonight?
[34:12.120 --> 34:32.120]  Well, we have acquired a piece of evidence, a classified submission by Jennifer Williams, something that she alluded to in her open testimony that in going back and looking through her records, she found other information that was pertinent to that phone call that we had asked her about and made that submission.
[34:32.120 --> 34:47.120]  There is nothing that should be classified in that submission, but yet the Vice President's office has said they are going to assert classification or that it's classified. It is not proper to classify something because it would be embarrassing or incriminating.
[34:47.120 --> 35:06.120]  And that submission does shed light on the Vice President's knowledge. We think the American people should see it. Certainly any senators in the trial should have access to it. But it just goes to show that there is a body of evidence, documentary, and otherwise, that administration figures from the President on down
[35:06.120 --> 35:26.120]  to include the Vice President do not want the American people to see or know. And the question is, will they succeed? Will the cover up succeed? Or will the Senate insist on what we were not able to obtain in the House? And that is a White House that will comply with lawful process.
[35:26.120 --> 35:49.120]  That's called lying in spades. They had no evidence as to why they went with obstruction of Congress and why they went with abuse of power, nebulous things. You can just subjectively nebulously make up.
[35:49.120 --> 36:18.120]  And saying that now Mike Pence is involved in the non-crime. They know what they're doing because they're dealing with their constituents who are completely illiterate when it comes to how to skin a buck, run a trot line, how to raise children, the separation of powers, history, government, science, literature, art.
[36:18.120 --> 36:41.120]  Every statistic shows that leftists are the most un-street smart domesticated dumbasses on Earth. Oh, but they know the 500 genders. There's now 500. It was 50 a few years ago. I'm not kidding. They know stuff like free spirit or elf or it's like Dungeons and Dragons.
[36:41.120 --> 36:54.120]  They invent new little things. It'll be, it'll be a million probably in a couple of years. It's like the Hindu gods. Invent one every hour if you want. There's probably a billion of them.
[36:54.120 --> 37:13.120]  And really they're just a salting reality. And then having UN reports out saying we're going to replace Europe with Muslims and the US. We want 600 million brought in in the next 30 years. The US official UN policy 2001 voted into policy.
[37:13.120 --> 37:31.120]  I had the printouts from a UN right here. The ADL says they're lying in the upcoming UK election. This is a month ago. And they're saying that there's a thing called replacement migration to get rid of Europeans with Muslims.
[37:31.120 --> 37:46.120]  They specifically say Middle Eastern Muslims and North African Muslims because they're more compatible with each other. Oh, they don't want any Christian, Christian Africans. They don't want any animus.
[37:46.120 --> 38:02.120]  Which is just nature worship, Gaia stuff, because the Muslims kill them. They go, we're going to have Muslims. They're the ones that are compatible because there was an Austrian Hungarian prince and pull it up.
[38:02.120 --> 38:18.120]  We had a whole plan 100 years ago. He's the guy that invented the modern Olympics to bring in Muslims. Napoleon converted to Islam and had a plan to bring the Muslims into Europe. You're like, why would he do that too?
[38:18.120 --> 38:36.120]  Because there were more Muslims than there were Christians in Europe then too. You could take over. They're one group that acts as one. But Sasha Baron Cohen like Napoleon has already cast the dice.
[38:36.120 --> 38:50.120]  The ADL now literally is an Islamic organization. Allied with it. You go read what their head talks about on Twitter. It's loved the Muslims this. Muslims are great that.
[38:50.120 --> 39:05.120]  Yeah, they're real great when they make your ass convert to the sword and put your daughter in sex slavery. I can't move to their countries. They'll kill my ass. But I got to bring them here.
[39:05.120 --> 39:12.120]  Like rubbing a newborn baby in bacon grease and throwing it into a group of starving pit bulls.
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.120]  I'm going to stop. I want to go to your calls.
[39:17.120 --> 39:23.120]  I didn't want to play some more of these clips.
[39:23.120 --> 39:38.120]  Here's old Crip Keeper. Nancy Pelosi says she's got a spring in her step. Oh, she was so solemn about the impeachment, didn't want to have to do it. Had big American flags up, big American flag pins. She loves America.
[39:38.120 --> 39:48.120]  She's doing it for America. Nobody should be happy. But now she's got a spring in her step and they're all, whoa, they pass the impeachment.
[39:48.120 --> 39:55.120]  Because it looks like action in front of their constituents who are so dumb they think that means Trump's been removed from office.
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.120]  And then now when he doesn't leave, they're going to get even more pissed.
[40:00.120 --> 40:05.120]  These people walk up to me with straight faces and go, you effing Russian.
[40:05.120 --> 40:10.120]  And I'll keep eating my dinner in a restaurant. I'll look up and I'll go, okay, you done now? Screw you.
[40:10.120 --> 40:20.120]  And then always I'll go, hey, lady, listen, I know you hate America and everything. You're pissing America's back and always the husband will be behind her. Don't bump into you.
[40:20.120 --> 40:30.120]  I go, that's it. Touch me again. You piece of crap. People's alone. I'm like, oh, oh, I get the perfect world. You attack me.
[40:30.120 --> 40:42.120]  And then you say I assault you by speaking back. That's the total inversion world from the top to the bottom. Democrats on average are now evil people.
[40:42.120 --> 40:48.120]  Savannah Hernandez and our great camera lady, Gabby got attacked. Her shoulder is hurt.
[40:48.120 --> 40:55.120]  Gabby's by men in Austin for having an accent seven, Mike.
[40:55.120 --> 41:02.120]  They hurt her, checked her with their shoulders.
[41:02.120 --> 41:06.120]  And when they did it, the police came over and they went.
[41:06.120 --> 41:10.120]  They attacked us. They hit us. Help us arrest them. Yes.
[41:10.120 --> 41:16.120]  They're all videos on her Twitter. Played a bunch of it yesterday.
[41:16.120 --> 41:20.120]  That's the religion. Is they punch you right in the face?
[41:20.120 --> 41:32.120]  And if you even hold your hand up to block, man, under leftist religion, you're sent to jail because they're gods, they're kings, they're lords, they're masters.
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.120]  It's unbelievable. We should probably add to that article, the video she updated that shows all of it in context.
[41:38.120 --> 41:40.120]  It's like 30 minutes of it. She uploaded. It's incredible.
[41:40.120 --> 41:54.120]  As they follow her around, as that woman follows her around and then says, why are you in my face? And then attacks her and pushes her off a curb while Gabby is attacked by men hitting her, running into her.
[41:54.120 --> 41:59.120]  They feel like they're entitled to do anything to us and they bully our children in school.
[41:59.120 --> 42:05.120]  They are a criminal mob of trash.
[42:05.120 --> 42:12.120]  All right, I'm going to play the clips when we come back and then I promise I'm going to go to these loaded phone lines on this live Friday Worldwide broadcast.
[42:12.120 --> 42:18.120]  I got a lot of calls yesterday. Crew did a wonderful job. Really appreciate them.
[42:18.120 --> 42:34.120]  But please remember, it's vital that people understand that, yes, this is blowing up in the globalist face, but that's only going to make them continue to get more aggressive and do crazier stuff, which is going to escalate to some type of breaking point, which I don't want to see happen.
[42:34.120 --> 42:38.120]  We'll get to Pelosi doting and then your calls.
[42:38.120 --> 42:46.120]  Barr saying, Comey's a liar, powerful video on the other side, whatever you do, tell people about the live feed upon info wars.com.
[42:46.120 --> 42:53.120]  The article has in the title that it's confirmed there is a coup attempt, not just to get Trump, but also against Pence.
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.120]  And we lay out how they're doing it and how it's stopping. It's vital to get it out.
[42:57.120 --> 43:06.120]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[43:06.120 --> 43:19.120]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise world leaders.
[43:19.120 --> 43:32.120]  They do not want this story continuing. And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word to have a piece of history and to fund our operation.
[43:32.120 --> 43:38.120]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein that these things don't hang themselves on the front.
[43:38.120 --> 43:52.120]  On the back, it's got info wars.com and shows the O and info wars as a wreath. That's also a noose. The system can't stand it when you promote things the grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America pro human media.
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.120]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[43:56.120 --> 44:09.120]  This is infowarstore.com.
[44:26.120 --> 44:36.120]  That's why they can shut info wars down. They can intimidate everybody else. That's why it's beyond critical that you keep info wars on the air. It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[44:36.120 --> 44:48.120]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support, but I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas and infowarstore.com.
[44:48.120 --> 44:58.120]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, infowarstore.com. Please take action now. George Soros hopes you don't.
[45:19.120 --> 45:33.120]  Not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[45:33.120 --> 45:42.120]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[45:42.120 --> 45:51.120]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com.
[45:51.120 --> 45:58.120]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the groupthink. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[45:58.120 --> 46:24.120]  Infowars has delivered. Infowars has come through time and time and time and time again. At that critical game-changing moment, we have come through. And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[46:24.120 --> 46:40.120]  There is no top. There is no bottom. We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen. And the stakes have never been higher. That's why the globalists want to take us out of the game. Only you keep Infowars in the game. You are the Infowar.
[46:40.120 --> 46:53.120]  And now, this Christmas, and come up to the end of the year, is the time to spend your money at infowarstore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[46:53.120 --> 46:58.120]  Huge sales right now. Now's the time to shop at infowarstore.com.
[47:23.120 --> 47:43.120]  The headline is at newswars.com.
[47:43.120 --> 47:57.120]  Red alert. Deep state announces plans to remove Pence after Trump conviction install Pelosi. They've announced that.
[47:57.120 --> 48:08.120]  You should probably add to that headline. I wrote that headline this morning. I dictated it. I guess I wasn't clear. I want to add dash install Pelosi. That's been announced.
[48:08.120 --> 48:19.120]  We told you that in 2017, almost three years ago, we told you that in 2018, in the live feed that you see posted there, we post links to those articles and those videos.
[48:19.120 --> 48:30.120]  We recapped it all in January, right before Roger Stone's gag order, laid it all out, played the clips, everything on that interview. And here they are.
[48:30.120 --> 48:50.120]  And again, why is that so important? Because we show back then how they were planning it. And since then, in the last few months, you've seen MSNBC CNN, all of them say, remove Trump and Pence, put in Pelosi, who then says she will appoint her vice president under the Constitution.
[48:50.120 --> 49:12.120]  And let me give you a thousand guesses who that's going to be Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton.
[49:12.120 --> 49:15.760]  That's why she doesn't need to make all the filing dates.
[49:15.760 --> 49:18.440]  She could try to come in during a broker convention
[49:18.440 --> 49:20.480]  or she can just have Pelosi put in and do it.
[49:20.480 --> 49:22.600]  You're like, well, that's super bold, that's crazy.
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.240]  Yeah, it's crazy to hold the Articles of Impeachment
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.560]  till the Senate does what they say and what they want.
[49:30.560 --> 49:32.440]  Now I'm gonna go to your calls,
[49:32.440 --> 49:34.000]  but next hour I'm gonna work in
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.600]  the Supreme Court ruling saying they can't do that.
[49:37.920 --> 49:39.280]  The top law professors,
[49:39.280 --> 49:42.200]  Curly Dershowitz, you name it.
[49:42.200 --> 49:44.600]  People say, oh, he was a lawyer for Epstein,
[49:44.600 --> 49:45.560]  yeah, and a bunch of other people.
[49:45.560 --> 49:47.960]  People deserve lawyers, it doesn't matter.
[49:47.960 --> 49:50.680]  Everybody knows that Dershowitz is brilliant.
[49:50.680 --> 49:52.280]  People need to be brilliant to know
[49:52.280 --> 49:53.520]  that this is all illegal.
[49:56.320 --> 49:59.040]  And so what does Trump need to do?
[49:59.040 --> 49:59.960]  What do we need to do?
[49:59.960 --> 50:02.040]  What does the Justice Department need to do?
[50:02.040 --> 50:09.040]  But here's Pelosi literally eyeing the presidency by coup,
[50:10.320 --> 50:15.360]  saying she's really gotta step in her step, here she is.
[50:15.360 --> 50:18.520]  It really is interesting to see the response
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.960]  that we are getting by partisan across party lines.
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.720]  I myself want to say I have a spring in my step
[50:25.720 --> 50:29.080]  because of the moral courage of our caucus
[50:29.080 --> 50:32.200]  to see them all, so many of a hundred members
[50:32.200 --> 50:35.760]  go to the floor, that's all that we had time for,
[50:35.760 --> 50:40.200]  to go to the floor and speak about our constitution,
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.200]  about the facts of the case so clearly, so patriotically,
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.520]  so prayerfully, and so solemnly, but so definitely.
[50:51.680 --> 50:53.760]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.720]  Now, here's what Attorney General Barr had to say
[50:58.720 --> 51:02.280]  when he was being interviewed yesterday.
[51:02.280 --> 51:04.400]  The full video is in the Kit Daniels article
[51:04.400 --> 51:05.560]  up on infowars.com.
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.680]  I suggest you watch it and suggest you share it.
[51:07.680 --> 51:10.680]  It's important because we're in information war.
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.480]  The average low information voter is a Democrat
[51:14.480 --> 51:18.480]  and thinks that Trump was just convicted.
[51:18.480 --> 51:21.560]  Again, you can politically indict a Ham sandwich.
[51:21.560 --> 51:26.560]  Travis County indicted Rick Perry as a governor
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.760]  for vetoing a spending bill which is passed
[51:32.880 --> 51:35.160]  by the legislature, his veto power.
[51:37.040 --> 51:42.040]  It's like arresting Tom Brady for playing for the Patriots.
[51:45.280 --> 51:46.600]  You're like, that's what he does.
[51:46.600 --> 51:48.240]  No, no, we're arresting him.
[51:48.240 --> 51:52.880]  We're arresting him, but they indicted Rick Perry.
[51:52.880 --> 51:54.760]  He had to spend $2 million fighting it
[51:54.760 --> 51:55.840]  over a year and a half.
[51:57.360 --> 51:59.560]  All the subpoenas digging through everything.
[52:01.480 --> 52:04.320]  Well, that's what I go through and I'm not complaining.
[52:04.320 --> 52:07.960]  I'm saying we're targets and I'm targeted
[52:07.960 --> 52:09.040]  by Travis County.
[52:11.400 --> 52:13.720]  I'm targeted by Connecticut.
[52:13.720 --> 52:16.760]  I'm targeted by Charlottesville.
[52:16.760 --> 52:18.880]  Democrats funded by Soros are suing me.
[52:20.280 --> 52:22.360]  And it doesn't matter if what they're saying is true.
[52:22.360 --> 52:24.600]  It doesn't matter what the reality is
[52:24.600 --> 52:27.240]  because these are controlled captured systems
[52:27.240 --> 52:29.320]  they're using that are weaponized.
[52:29.320 --> 52:31.720]  So what is the attorney general going to do?
[52:33.280 --> 52:37.560]  The attorney general needs to move against the deep state
[52:37.560 --> 52:38.960]  and the criminality they're engaged in
[52:38.960 --> 52:40.920]  because again, every time it fails,
[52:40.920 --> 52:45.920]  we go, oh look, Trump's Teflon, it's a dereliction of duty.
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.600]  The attorney general must act.
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.720]  They must execute the law faithfully.
[52:50.760 --> 52:52.800]  We can't sit here and take this.
[52:55.080 --> 52:57.480]  Oh, but Trump's up in the polls.
[52:57.480 --> 52:59.920]  It won't matter if they scare all his cabinet
[52:59.920 --> 53:01.360]  and get them to vote 25th amendment.
[53:01.360 --> 53:04.080]  It won't matter if they threaten the Senate enough
[53:05.440 --> 53:07.200]  and remove him.
[53:11.440 --> 53:14.840]  So here's what the attorney general had to say.
[53:14.840 --> 53:17.200]  It's powerful, it's strong.
[53:17.200 --> 53:18.800]  If you're sitting on top of an organization
[53:18.800 --> 53:22.320]  of 38,000 people, you can't run an investigation
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.680]  that's seven layers below you.
[53:23.680 --> 53:26.400]  You have to leave it to the career professionals to do.
[53:26.400 --> 53:27.400]  Do you believe that?
[53:27.400 --> 53:31.400]  No, I think that one of the problems
[53:31.400 --> 53:33.680]  with what happened was precisely
[53:33.680 --> 53:35.880]  that they pulled the investigation up
[53:35.880 --> 53:37.320]  to the executive floors.
[53:37.320 --> 53:41.720]  And it was run and bird-dogged by a very small group
[53:41.720 --> 53:44.240]  of very high level officials.
[53:44.240 --> 53:46.640]  And the idea that this was seven layers
[53:46.640 --> 53:48.840]  below him is simply not true.
[53:48.840 --> 53:50.760]  He also said that he told the president three times
[53:50.760 --> 53:53.120]  that he was not the target of the investigation.
[53:53.120 --> 53:55.120]  Do you believe, based on what we know now,
[53:55.120 --> 53:57.680]  that the president was not the target
[53:57.680 --> 53:59.960]  of Crossfire Hurricane or wasn't one of them?
[54:00.920 --> 54:05.920]  Well, I think effectively the president
[54:06.320 --> 54:09.560]  was being investigated.
[54:09.560 --> 54:12.240]  They were investigating the Trump campaign
[54:12.240 --> 54:14.840]  and Trump associates.
[54:14.840 --> 54:17.440]  But again, as I've said,
[54:17.440 --> 54:22.200]  what happened after the election to me is very questionable.
[54:22.200 --> 54:24.520]  And I think there has to be a lot of focus
[54:24.520 --> 54:26.440]  as to what happened after the campaign.
[54:26.440 --> 54:29.120]  And they learned that their whole case had collapsed
[54:29.120 --> 54:31.440]  and they really had no basis to take it further.
[54:31.440 --> 54:33.320]  And so we are looking into that.
[54:33.320 --> 54:35.400]  Do you think we need to reform the FISA court system?
[54:35.400 --> 54:37.360]  Some people are even calling for it to be removed
[54:37.360 --> 54:38.560]  because there's no opportunity
[54:38.560 --> 54:40.520]  for the person who's presenting the evidence
[54:40.520 --> 54:43.160]  to have another side make the argument
[54:43.160 --> 54:46.960]  for why this surveillance perhaps should not be done?
[54:46.960 --> 54:50.040]  No, I don't think we need to do anything that radical.
[54:50.040 --> 54:52.640]  I do, you know, I think both Chris Ray and I
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.640]  take the problems and the misconduct
[54:58.960 --> 55:00.440]  of the past very seriously.
[55:00.440 --> 55:03.440]  And Chris has been particularly proactive
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.920]  in developing a number of reforms
[55:05.920 --> 55:07.720]  that are designed to address that.
[55:07.720 --> 55:08.960]  And I'm evaluating those
[55:08.960 --> 55:11.360]  and considering some additional steps.
[55:11.360 --> 55:12.880]  But I think we can...
[55:12.880 --> 55:14.160]  You know, you've seen a lot of posturing
[55:14.160 --> 55:15.000]  by the FISA court.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.120]  We may never listen to another FBI secret warrant again.
[55:21.040 --> 55:23.840]  By its very nature, a star chamber, a secret court
[55:23.840 --> 55:26.880]  will be abused, they always are.
[55:26.880 --> 55:28.120]  It was only for Al Qaeda,
[55:28.120 --> 55:30.640]  which the globalists were funding.
[55:30.640 --> 55:32.520]  But now, oh, it's for the president,
[55:32.520 --> 55:34.960]  it's for Roger Stone, it's for Alex Jones,
[55:34.960 --> 55:36.880]  it's for the members of the press.
[55:36.880 --> 55:39.440]  So Adam Schiff can dial in and see what you've been up to.
[55:39.440 --> 55:40.960]  All right, we're gonna start the next hour.
[55:40.960 --> 55:42.800]  Next segment, I will go to your calls.
[55:42.800 --> 55:45.440]  Jeff Bob, Daniel, Pastor Sam Lewis,
[55:45.440 --> 55:48.600]  Chase, John, Cindy, Ranger, Carlos,
[55:48.600 --> 55:49.440]  and everybody else.
[55:49.440 --> 55:50.560]  I see a lot of regulars there.
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.640]  That's why I said open phones for everybody.
[55:53.640 --> 55:55.920]  Then after we go to this raft of calls,
[55:55.920 --> 55:57.680]  about a half of them look like regulars,
[55:57.680 --> 55:59.760]  we will open up on the second half of the show

[59:51.960 --> 59:54.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:09.760]  Cindy's up first in John, Chase, Lewis, Daniel,
[1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:14.040]  Ranger, Carlos, Bob, so many others on this December 20th,
[1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:18.200]  2019 global transmission.
[1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:22.520]  And I'll be live tomorrow, 2 p.m.
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:24.760]  Last week I came in to do it, had some technical stuff,
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:27.880]  went out and just taped it to be on a skeleton crew.
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:30.200]  We're trying to hire more folks who are doing an amazing job.
[1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:32.760]  Then I'll be back Sunday also, 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.600]  There's so much happening and I'm going to be here most
[1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:38.840]  the next week too because I was planning some vacation
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:42.200]  but we're going to be here because history's happening
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.120]  and they want to try to ram all this through
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:45.320]  while we're not paying attention.
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:46.560]  Well, we're going to be paying attention
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.520]  and I know you are as well.
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:51.800]  You're all watchmen and watch women on the wall.
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:55.080]  I'm not being patronizing, telling you you're important
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:56.320]  to make you feel important.
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:58.120]  You are.
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:00:59.960]  That's why when you call and tell me how great I am,
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.080]  I say, OK, great, look in the mirror, please.
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:05.600]  You care, you tune in, you support, you spread the word.
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:06.520]  I'm going to explain it.
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:08.680]  It's like having an appliance that's electrical
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.600]  and not having a plug to plug it into.
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:12.320]  It's worthless.
[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:18.720]  You are this operation.
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:24.320]  So believe me, without you, they're going to be able
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:28.040]  to isolate me, shut me down, lie about me, put me in prison.
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:29.160]  That's their plan.
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:30.720]  And I'm going to explain that later at the bottom of the hour.
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:33.280]  I meant to talk about something at the start of the show
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:33.960]  that's really important.
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:35.880]  I didn't spend a few minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:37.120]  I'm going to remember to do it.
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:39.720]  The crew's going to remind me, OK,
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:43.400]  I want to go to Cindy first because she kind of disagrees
[1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:45.920]  with what we're saying, I guess, and which is fine.
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:47.520]  She doesn't have to apologize for that.
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:49.600]  She says it's all Trump's fault.
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.200]  Could have avoided all of this.
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:53.520]  And in some ways, I think actually Cindy, I agree with you.
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:56.120]  Cindy, what do you want to say?
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:57.640]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:01.560]  I just think that Trump had a chance a long time ago
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:03.320]  to stop this.
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:05.880]  He could have done the Infergency Act.
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:08.480]  He could have stopped these low-life people.
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:09.960]  Look at Kate's family.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:11.760]  That poor woman was shot to death.
[1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:12.760]  And what did they do?
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.880]  They allowed sanctuary cities.
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:16.240]  Those things should have been stopped.
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:19.520]  The illegal alien just wanted to kill her because she was white.
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:21.920]  And then the liberals went, well, you're a Mexican.
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:23.120]  She's been deported five times.
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:24.240]  You're allowed to murder her.
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:25.800]  And then they said, he's a victim.
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:28.920]  And now he's suing the jail where he was held.
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:29.880]  She was with her dad.
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.680]  She just shot her in the back for fun.
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:36.120]  How does that make you feel in America?
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:37.360]  Well, I mean, here's my deal.
[1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:38.720]  I don't care if you're brown or white.
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:41.280]  You don't want anybody being able to just shoot a young woman
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:43.160]  in the back for no reason.
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:44.000]  You're right.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.200]  And he shot her because she was beautiful.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:47.560]  And if you notice anything, I don't
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:50.360]  care if a beautiful black woman, brown woman, white woman.
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:52.640]  There are a lot of people jealous of beautiful women.
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:56.320]  And Kate Steinle was gorgeous, beautiful.
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:59.160]  And he killed her because he was pissed and jealous
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:02.560]  and thought that that was her older boyfriend.
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:04.400]  It was her dad hugging her.
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:06.800]  And they were crying and talking about family members
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:08.000]  that had just died.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.480]  And he saw that and thought he saw a couple together.
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:14.880]  And he murdered her because he was jealous.
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:16.400]  Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a rant.
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.640]  So what has Trump done?
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:20.520]  He's done nothing.
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:22.360]  He's playing the businessman.
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:23.080]  That's fine.
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:26.880]  What's time for a Trump to quit playing Mr. Businessman
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:30.120]  and step into the shoes of Eisenhower.
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:32.760]  We don't need a businessman right now.
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:34.000]  We need a soldier.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.480]  Like when Obama went through and he
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:39.760]  had no problem giving pink slips to all the patriots
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:41.280]  and the military.
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:44.120]  And you know why he did that to weaken our military.
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:46.920]  It's time for Trump to get those patriots back
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:48.080]  in our military.
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:48.580]  Oh, yeah.
[1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:51.400]  They made the army wear high heels.
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:54.000]  They make the Marines pose while a 100-pound woman stands
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.600]  over and tells them men suck to put that out
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:57.960]  to kill recruitment.
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:01.520]  It's all globalist sabotage.
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:02.120]  You're right.
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:04.720]  And we need good people to join the military to piss on that
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:06.440]  and not let them override it.
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:08.840]  We need people to join the military now
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:11.760]  to counter that in the leftist and to go in there to block
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:12.280]  them.
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:15.440]  The left takes over the seminaries, the schools,
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:17.640]  the military to run good people out.
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:20.120]  Instead of running away from it, you run in there
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:22.800]  and you stop their sabotaging.
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:26.040]  I agree with you 100% on that.
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:27.880]  150% on that.
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:29.760]  Yeah, we don't need to run away from the attack.
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:31.560]  We need to run towards it.
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:32.400]  I bless you, ma'am.
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:34.840]  Yeah, Trump needs to take some damn action.
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:35.480]  And you know what?
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:36.240]  I can feel it.
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.560]  You're going to see action.
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:39.760]  Because he knows they're going for his juggler.
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.400]  It's dangerous to grant these people,
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:44.280]  but it's more dangerous not to.
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:47.840]  The battle is joined.
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:50.320]  You can feel the energy.
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:52.720]  You can feel the fight.
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:56.720]  Stand up now.
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:58.320]  I'm here to give the listeners of yours
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:01.520]  a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:03.320]  And here's the bottom line.
[1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:04.760]  I'm not playing around.
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:06.200]  I'm not screwing around.
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:07.080]  I'm not joking.
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:09.160]  And neither are you.
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:10.160]  Info wars.
[1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:11.960]  And this operation we built together
[1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:15.880]  has delivered for America, has delivered for our children
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:19.400]  and the unborn, has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:24.480]  and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:27.320]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:28.520]  And did you hear the key word?
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:33.800]  What we are doing is beyond critical.
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:37.240]  So this is the time with the biggest sales
[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:40.880]  ever during Christmas at infowars.com to get in there
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:42.480]  and buy these products you already
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:45.840]  need that I need the funding for to get
[1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:47.840]  this operation to the next level.
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:49.360]  I need the money.
[1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:51.600]  I need to be able to fight the globalist.
[1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:52.840]  I need you.
[1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:54.000]  You need these products.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:12.840]  Get them at infowars.com.
[1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:17.560]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas,
[1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:22.440]  transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:24.800]  I'm going to talk about something at the bottom of the hour
[1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:28.480]  that's so critical, so important in understanding this fight
[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:31.400]  and understanding the enemy's mindset of how they try
[1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:37.280]  to frame things and how narrative is everything.
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:38.920]  We're on your calls right now.
[1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:42.080]  I'm taking 20 of them this hour.
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:43.720]  All right, who's been holding the longest?
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:44.680]  Is it John in Kentucky?
[1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:46.680]  Is it Ranger in Texas?
[1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:47.760]  Is it Carlos in Canada?
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:48.960]  Jeff in Canada?
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.600]  Bob in Oregon.
[1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:53.520]  Who has been holding the longest?
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:57.880]  I guess that would be Ranger in Texas.
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:00.600]  You're on the air, Ranger.
[1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:01.600]  Well, good morning, Alex.
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:05.680]  Hey, first I got to say thanks for your product.
[1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:06.600]  I called in a while ago.
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:08.240]  I didn't mention them before.
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:09.280]  Well, thank you, sir.
[1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:11.240]  What's your favorite product?
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:12.400]  Iodine, actually.
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.680]  Everybody's deficient on it.
[1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:16.200]  Yeah, I'm right.
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:19.920]  Encyclopedia Britannica, World Health Organization.
[1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:25.520]  Over 2 billion people have, quote, mental deficiencies
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:27.760]  because of iodine deficiency.
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:33.040]  The number one cause of low IQ, infertility, so many.
[1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:35.760]  I mean, and of course, it's like a chess piece.
[1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:38.600]  They try to put the bad fluoride, the bad halogen on us.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:42.520]  We bring the good halogen in.
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:43.000]  Go ahead.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:43.800]  Sure.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:44.320]  Sure.
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:48.800]  So my son, he's got problems with his adrenal gland.
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:51.480]  So a number of years ago, we started him on some iodine,
[1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:54.240]  and the improvement was just incredible.
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:56.680]  Sir, you'd think I knew all this.
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:59.840]  But like I said, about eight years ago, Dr. Group came in here
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:02.200]  and he goes, hey, are you taking iodine?
[1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:02.880]  And I said, no.
[1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.920]  And he goes, we know everybody's deficient in it.
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:06.520]  And I said, yeah, I knew they used to put it in the salt.
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:07.880]  And I know China puts it in their water.
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:09.240]  And he goes, yeah, their IQ keeps going up.
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:10.680]  He goes, here, here's the bottle of stuff
[1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:11.560]  I plan to come out with.
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:13.680]  I'm trying to get the license with the DEA.
[1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.280]  Nobody puts out real atomic iodine.
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:16.040]  They all say they do.
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:16.800]  The other stuff's bad.
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:17.440]  Here's this.
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:18.720]  It'll be out in six months or so.
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:20.400]  And that's how we launched X2.
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:23.000]  He goes, those sunspots, you've got stuff, all of it.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:24.400]  He goes, take this.
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:26.960]  You'll feel terrible in about two to three weeks.
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:29.520]  That's the detoxification in about a week.
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:30.440]  You'll feel better.
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:32.800]  He goes, a bunch of stuff will come out of your skin.
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:35.160]  He said, but you'll automatically get, I mean,
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:36.800]  and this is medical stuff, so I'll say it.
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:38.360]  He goes, you're going to get much bigger
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:41.160]  erections in the morning with like you're 15 years old.
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:42.560]  That's when you know it's really kicking in
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:45.040]  because it'll activate all your glands.
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:47.680]  Man, boom, baby, boom.
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:49.000]  And everybody's like eight years ago,
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.360]  because I was really getting fat and unhealthy.
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:51.880]  They go, how do you lose all this weight?
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:54.120]  Why are you suddenly, you know, your skin's clear?
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:55.600]  And it was the iodine.
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:57.840]  And then I'll go sometimes and forget to take it
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:08:59.840]  like a month and I start feeling like crap and stuff.
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:03.880]  And I go back on it and it's literally incredible.
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:06.080]  People ask, how the hell I have so much energy?
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:08.400]  I am on X2 and X3, baby.
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:09.960]  I didn't mean to make that a plug.
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:10.760]  I'm sorry.
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:11.760]  Tell me what happened with your son.
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:13.320]  I'm going to shut up.
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:15.160]  Oh no, it's, you know what?
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:16.160]  Go on about it.
[1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:17.080]  It really is great.
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:19.200]  I mean, heck, if I don't take it for a week or two,
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:21.560]  you know, we ran out, I had no order support for him yet.
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:22.920]  I didn't realize we were out.
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:25.080]  I mean, that whole week was just a bummer week.
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.840]  I was down the whole week.
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:29.360]  But no, my son had adrenal glands issues.
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:32.200]  And when he was growing up, we went and saw doctors
[1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:34.880]  about how we could get him to improve his attitude,
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:36.280]  his mood, his behavior.
[1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:38.120]  And they couldn't find anything wrong.
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:40.480]  So we had to take him to a natural path.
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.920]  And they did some blood work in a year and a half
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:45.520]  to find him and said, well, his adrenal glands
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:47.760]  are not working out very well.
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:50.920]  And apparently, it's not an uncommon thing.
[1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:53.120]  John Kennedy had this.
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:55.720]  If you don't have things like selenium and iodine,
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:58.800]  they burn out because they have to use similar things
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  in the periodic table that aren't the same,
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:05.000]  that work for a while, but then fry them.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Yeah, and the iodine, you know, and the best thing about it
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.520]  is it's liquid, right?
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:10.640]  My wife doesn't take pills.
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.200]  She can't do that.
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:13.680]  But she likes the iodine because it's
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:15.480]  the liquid and it's something she can take.
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:18.760]  Well, again, I don't have time to get into it all,
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:21.560]  but don't go to Walgreens, folks, and buy the topical stuff
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:22.080]  and eat it.
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:23.080]  It'll hurt you.
[1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:24.440]  That's not really real iodine.
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:25.080]  It's bound.
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:26.160]  It's mixed in with things.
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:26.960]  It's different.
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:29.120]  This is real, X2, X3.
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.800]  And consult the physician regardless,
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:34.320]  because if you haven't had iodine and your body's
[1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:37.000]  been using the bad stuff, bromine, chlorine, fluoride,
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.800]  it could be a bumpy ride.
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:42.200]  I mean, this is serious stuff.
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.440]  There's a reason we've got to have a DEA-certified facility
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:46.680]  to have it.
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:51.760]  Now, by the time it's put into the organic palm oil and things
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:54.040]  and delivered to you, it's legal.
[1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:57.680]  But it's a controlled substance because real iodine
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:10:59.640]  is used in the production of a whole bunch
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:02.880]  of different illegal drugs because it's a major precursor
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:04.920]  and it's very powerful.
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:07.400]  So when you watch like Breaking Bad and they're robbing
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:09.520]  warehouses at night for iodine, that's
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:12.720]  what you use making methamphetamine.
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:14.200]  It isn't like methamphetamine, folks.
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:16.360]  There's nothing to do with it except in the making of it.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.360]  It's just the real, pure stuff is not sold out there
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.160]  because no one would actually do what group did.
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:26.400]  And so that's why X2 and X3 are so different.
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:26.880]  Sorry.
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:27.760]  I'm going to stop, Randy.
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:29.960]  I'm going to get to the impeachment news, but go ahead.
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:31.520]  Yeah, no.
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:33.240]  It tastes good.
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:36.680]  My only experience with iodine before was in the military
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:38.480]  when you have to take iodines out.
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.200]  They give you these two orange terrible tasting pills
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:44.920]  that they're just terrible.
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.440]  That's a different type of iodine,
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:48.200]  and it's still better than nothing.
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:49.280]  And it's a big dose.
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:51.320]  Obviously, you were doing that for radiation drill
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.440]  emergency test?
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:55.040]  Yeah, we had a couple of places when
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:56.640]  we were being deployed that we needed
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:11:59.640]  to take it for just the sake of argument,
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.480]  so they didn't have any problems with it.
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:01.800]  Sure.
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:03.280]  And of course, we sell that too.
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:06.800]  Like the New York Times is like, he sells iodine for radiation.
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:09.280]  Yes, the rad pills at the military
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:12.280]  and that any Army Navy store sells,
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:15.000]  that's for a radiological event to protect the thyroid.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.320]  Yes, we sell that.
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:20.800]  It's totally normal and totally above board and totally good.
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:22.440]  Anyway, sorry.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:22.720]  No.
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:25.240]  That's not why we sell the X2, even though it's
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.480]  good for that as well.
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:31.320]  Well, I try and stay stocked up on it.
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:33.600]  We usually buy it in a pack of six bottles
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:34.920]  because we get a little bit better deal.
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:36.560]  I think it's on your website.
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:39.280]  Well, I'm just going to tell you, you've got to be careful with it.
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:44.040]  And even what most things with the FDA,
[1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:47.240]  they have a lower level than what a lot of experts think you need.
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:49.880]  But with iodine, it's pretty high level, they say you can actually have.
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:51.000]  That's what we've got on the bottle.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.920]  But just be careful with it, everybody, because it's not a game.
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:56.240]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.080]  You die without it.
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:12:59.640]  You die without iodine.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:01.840]  You die, OK?
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:04.960]  But then if you haven't had it for years
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:06.800]  and your body's all screwed up, it's
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:10.760]  kind of like putting 100 octane gas in an old truck that's
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:14.040]  been running on crappy 87 and it's all clogged up.
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:17.320]  You get in there, floor it, and go driving down the road 100 miles an hour.
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.520]  The engine may throw a rod, or you may have a piston seize up.
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:23.160]  So just it's nitrous oxide, folks.
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:24.720]  And I'm going to stop plugging.
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.640]  But yes, X2 is 60% off.
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:28.760]  So is X3 at m4store.com.
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:29.080]  Go ahead.
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:30.880]  Sorry, I'm going to stop branding.
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:31.600]  No, you're great.
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:35.120]  So anyway, the point that I wanted to get to was this,
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:39.520]  our country has already been invaded, the fact we're already,
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:44.280]  there are steps that are taken whenever a country is invaded from
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:45.920]  without or from within.
[1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:47.800]  And one of them is destroying the culture.
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:50.080]  Unfortunately, step number eight.
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:52.920]  And when they get to number nine, then that
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:55.680]  means that they've reached the point where they're
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:59.320]  saturated with enough people that are going to go along with their agenda.
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:01.720]  And I think we're very close to that point now.
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:06.440]  But beyond that, in 2001, George Bush brought an act out.
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:07.800]  Actually, I think it was George Bush.
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.280]  It might have been Clinton that did this.
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:13.880]  PDD-51, PDD-51 said that.
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:15.880]  Presidential Decision Directive, yes.
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:18.480]  Saying we would absorb a first strike.
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:19.000]  Right.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:27.160]  But it also said that the president could lay the country in basically a martial law status.
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:27.680]  Oh, you're right.
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:31.480]  The globalists have given the presidency dictatorial powers.
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.600]  And I'm not, I'm not for those.
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:38.200]  But Trump now has them and we're in a real crisis against globalists,
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:40.840]  which he already had powers before that to act against.
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:43.840]  Because the Democrats are being funded by foreign powers on record,
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:45.480]  the Chai comms own Hollywood.
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.920]  Damn right, he has a right and a duty to move against them.
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:50.160]  Go ahead.
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:51.160]  Exactly, exactly.
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:52.920]  So I used to do private security.
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:57.000]  We were working on a boat one time, a large vessel that was actually
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.200]  a pirate came on board.
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:14:59.320]  They actually got on board.
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:00.800]  Usually it's not a big concern.
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:03.800]  They generally don't have boats that will fast enough.
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:06.920]  But when that did happen, the captain put the boat on lockdown.
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:09.440]  Everybody went to their cabins and locked the doors.
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:13.640]  We went room to room, you know, clearing the boat out.
[1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:19.240]  Well, maybe it's time that the president looks at putting the country on lockdown.
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:21.400]  All right, that is the perfect analogy.
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:24.040]  And we just spent 10 minutes with me interrupting you and you talking about
[1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:28.120]  that, I'm going to come back to you to have the floor with a two minute video
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:30.560]  because I want to make it a promo that we are during the breaks,
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:32.320]  that that is the perfect allegory.
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:33.520]  The globalist are pirates.
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:34.520]  They're not Americans.
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:35.520]  They're not following the law.
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.320]  They admit they want to overthrow the will of the people.
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:41.960]  Pelosi, Nadler, they've all said, oh, we're afraid he's going to get reelected.
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:43.440]  They've admitted their crime.
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:44.440]  It is a coup.
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:45.960]  It's like clearing pirates.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:49.920]  We've got to do it because they're going to only escalate when we kick their ass this
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:50.920]  time.
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:51.920]  So we come back.
[1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:56.080]  We're going to make your statement again on that in completion.
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:30.880]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the Empire of
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:31.880]  the World.
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:34.880]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:40.840]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:44.640]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:45.640]  Was there ever a vote?
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:47.200]  Who do we fight for?
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:50.080]  The deep state began with World War I.
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:55.960]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.480]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:04.720]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:09.520]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:13.160]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:17.680]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:18.680]  across America.
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:22.600]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:26.240]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:27.240]  healthier I feel.
[1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.920]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:35.080]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:37.600]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:17:57.200 --> 1:18:00.600]  Info Wars has delivered.
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:06.040]  Info Wars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:13.080]  At that critical game-changing moment, we have come through.
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.960]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers,
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:22.800]  the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:23.800]  There is no top.
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:24.800]  There is no bottom.
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:28.680]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:30.560]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:32.840]  That's why the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:36.600]  Only you keep Info Wars in the game.
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:38.120]  You are the Info War.
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:42.080]  And now this Christmas, and coming up to the end of the year, is the time to spend your
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:48.120]  money at infowarstore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:51.720]  great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:52.720]  Huge sales right now.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:57.120]  Now is the time to shop at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:03.960]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:04.960]  sweater.
[1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:09.520]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:14.960]  about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:18.200]  children to compromise world leaders.
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:20.800]  They do not want this story continuing.
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:27.480]  And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:31.080]  to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:35.480]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein, but these things don't hang
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:40.640]  themselves on the front, on the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:41.640]  as a wreath.
[1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:43.240]  It's also a noose.
[1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:46.920]  The system can't stand it when you promote things to grassroots level.
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:51.240]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America, pro human media.
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:20:18.200]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today, infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:26.040]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report if you are receiving this transmission.
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:32.800]  You are the resistance if I seem more craves than normal.
[1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:39.280]  I mean, we've got literal globalists that are super evil trying to overthrow this awesome
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:43.200]  president after all these decades of corruption.
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:46.480]  Their ally with the chai comms and have killed over a hundred million people.
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:53.920]  They literally promote pedophilia everywhere and a bunch of more devil worshipers and they're
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:00.320]  complete liars and they can hardly talk and walk and a lot of the public thinks the president
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:06.960]  is a criminal now and they're moving forward to remove Pence and try to put Pelosi in.
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:13.960]  They're not going to succeed, but they could succeed in a civil war, which is what they
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:14.960]  want.
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:17.400]  They're going to go for the guns now in a bunch of states and they're going to confiscate
[1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:20.080]  them starting next year because they don't have federal controls.
[1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:24.600]  They're going to start at the states in Oregon and California and Virginia.
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:27.880]  I mean, it's on man.
[1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:38.160]  And so, yeah, yeah, my spirit, my instincts are engaged and we just had a caller and he
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:41.800]  just joined us who laid it all out.
[1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:46.880]  Now, he did security on a ship that actually got boarded by pirates and what the captain
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:48.480]  did in that emergency.
[1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:50.040]  I don't want martial law.
[1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:51.240]  I don't want civil war.
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:54.600]  The globalists are putting us into the national emergency and they're violating the law at
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:59.080]  every front, trying to overthrow an election, illegally spying, intimidating everybody.
[1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:03.320]  The stuff they've done to me doesn't make me a victim, but it makes me know how criminal
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:04.320]  they are.
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:07.560]  And I've been asked by law enforcement and security and lawyers and others not to get
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:12.440]  into it for a lot of reasons, but whatever you've heard on air, they've been doing to
[1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:13.440]  us.
[1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:14.440]  It's about five times worse.
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:18.440]  I mean, these people are crooks.
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:26.400]  These people are criminals and they are recruiting armies of fellow Americans to bear false witness,
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:31.480]  to lie, to cheat, to steal, to poison people, to attack people's families, to do unethical
[1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:34.400]  stuff that I am shocked goes on.
[1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:37.120]  They're making their move.
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:41.320]  And so in two minutes, my friend, give us that analogy again and have some time, flesh
[1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:42.320]  that out.
[1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:43.320]  Go ahead.
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:44.320]  Go ahead.
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:45.320]  Ranger in Texas.
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:49.960]  Well, like I said, we're just doing private security on a boat.
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:52.800]  There's places in the world where it's not as secure as others.
[1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:53.800]  But take your time.
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:54.800]  I mean, you got a few minutes.
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:57.080]  Lay out where you were, what happened, and then the allegory.
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:22:58.080]  Just take your time.
[1:22:58.080 --> 1:22:59.080]  Sure.
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:04.880]  Well, we were off the coast of Africa, running security for a large vessel for, let's say,
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:09.720]  a big name company that has had problems with pirates in the past.
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:10.720]  We secured the boat.
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:15.600]  There were 12 of us that were doing security on this particular run.
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:19.720]  When the pirate made it aboard, the first thing the captain did was come on intercom
[1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:24.000]  and tell everybody that they needed to go in their cabin to lock their doors, that somebody
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  would be coming to every cabin and checking every cabin, and to stay still and make sure
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.440]  your hands are visible when the door opens.
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:38.200]  And it just seems to me like this is the time when Trump is either going to do something
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:45.160]  or we're going to lose what we have here as a president.
[1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:53.040]  And I say that because he could very easily enact PDD 51, stay the Congress and stay the
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:59.520]  Senate for six months, do what he needs to do, route the rats out.
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:04.040]  And I'm not the most avid Trump supporter, but I still recognize that what they're doing
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:05.640]  is wrong.
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:09.520]  And I think it's about time that he took the gloves off.
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:15.360]  It just seems like Donald Trump is playing really pretty easy with a lot of these people.
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:21.280]  Well, he's a smart guy, but I agree with you that there's a point when things are criminal
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:25.240]  and people are having their rights violated in mass, that you've got to stand up against
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:30.120]  a criminal mob of out-of-control bureaucrats being funded by foreign corporations because
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:31.600]  of your oath.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:36.480]  And so sometimes you just can't be pragmatic like lawyers want him to be and go, oh, you
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:40.640]  know, it's discrediting them, you know, they're going to stop now, no, they're going to keep
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:43.040]  escalating and anybody can see that.
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:45.040]  So I'm not looking for a big escalation.
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:46.560]  They're the ones that are bringing it.
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:48.080]  They're the ones that are starting it.
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:49.920]  And we can't put up with it anymore.
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:51.920]  You agree with me?
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:52.920]  Absolutely.
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:53.920]  Absolutely.
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:57.880]  And I think that's the problem we have is we got to the point where, like I said, Trump
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.000]  needs to do something big because they're doing something big.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.600]  They're trying to force him out of office.
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:06.280]  They're trying to get Mike Pence out as well.
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:11.600]  And if that happens, then, you know, then we're going to end up really bad, really
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  quickly.
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:13.600]  That's right.
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:14.600]  Drudge had the headline, you know, Trump Plots His Vengeance.
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:17.280]  And then I read the article, what is the vengeance?
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:18.280]  Winning in 2020?
[1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:22.760]  They're just going to cook up something new then and then sabotage the government and
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:27.280]  block everything and harass everybody and keep funding all this DNC lawsuits against
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:28.280]  me.
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:29.280]  God bless you.
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:30.780]  I appreciate your call.
[1:25:30.780 --> 1:25:31.780]  Great points, Ranger.
[1:25:31.780 --> 1:25:32.780]  All right.
[1:25:32.780 --> 1:25:33.780]  Let's talk to Jeff in Canada.
[1:25:33.780 --> 1:25:35.280]  Jeff, thanks for holding.
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:40.280]  Hey, Alex, I have some massive breaking news.
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:48.640]  It's been coming out that Trump has had a love child with one of his closest friends
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:53.680]  and teammates and that he was worried about that coming out.
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.320]  And he actually, he actually had him killed.
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:06.080]  Of course I'm joking, but hear me out as much as a shock as that was to hear that.
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:08.640]  And I'm sure everybody was shocked by it.
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:10.600]  That's what King David did.
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:17.160]  And I'm calling out Christians today because Christians will wave the flag of Christianity
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:23.720]  and I'm a Christian, by the way, but Christians will say that David was a man after God's
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:24.720]  own heart.
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:31.160]  But I see the hypocrisy that's happening now against Christians that are not standing
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:36.640]  with their president, with their leaders, whether you like him or not.
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:42.080]  The Bible says that we're to pray for our leaders if you like him or not.
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:48.760]  And today, Papa Drudge, Christianity today comes out calling for the removal of Donald
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:50.600]  Trump saying that he should be out of there.
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:53.800]  I think that's completely disgusting.
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:27:00.080]  You know, Jesus said, if they're not against you, they're for you.
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:05.840]  And I'm seeing so much friendly fire of people on the internet shooting at each other, Christians
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:09.760]  shooting at each other, and it's time to wake the F up.
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:15.200]  No, you're right, that's the top of DrudgeReport.com right now, the evangelical group that's obviously
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:16.200]  been bought off.
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:20.280]  That's the new talking point last month by CNN, MSNBC, remember they said Pelosi is
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:25.160]  the moral authority now, she's the Christian, she's invoked Christ.
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:31.440]  Because now the new move is, oh look, the Christians shouldn't support Trump because
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:36.520]  he's got a hot wife or he's done this or that or he isn't perfect or he says cuss words
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:37.520]  sometimes.
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:38.720]  He's never been a hypocrite.
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.040]  He knew who he was.
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:43.800]  He promised to get the IRS off the backs of the churches, they're violating the First
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:44.800]  Amendment.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:45.800]  He promised religious freedom.
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:47.240]  He promised to stand up for pro-life.
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:48.240]  He's doing it.
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:53.200]  None of these other fake Christians have done that and as you said, God judges the heart.
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:28:00.400]  King David loved God, loved justice, but he was a man and he had lust and he got out
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:04.560]  of control and he sent his best friend off to get killed, as you said, because he wanted
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:09.400]  his hot wife and then later he repented and God knew it was real and said, you're a man
[1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:13.800]  of my own heart for that because you don't think God doesn't have passions.
[1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:18.240]  God hates evil and God hates wimps and cowards more than anything else.
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:21.920]  People that feed on innocence and bullies and scum and you're absolutely right and if
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:26.400]  you test the spirit on Trump, you get a good response back from the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:29.320]  You look at these globalists, you just get redlined.
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:33.040]  That's a devil worship or Pelosi, Hillary, all of them tell you how good they are, how
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:38.520]  loving they are, how great they are and they're a pack of devil worshiping, child molesting,
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.240]  supporting trash.
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:41.920]  Every damn one of them.
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:44.920]  You know Trump's good because evil is out of control.
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:49.320]  They have witches and devil worshipers coast to coast, constantly doing satanic rituals
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:51.720]  against him and it's all over the news.
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:55.960]  My God, the devils mattered in hell at Donald Trump.
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:59.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:04.320]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data

[1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:03.600]  you're old or young.
[1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:08.440]  As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down.
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:13.360]  Now in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does but look into the
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:19.520]  fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis and
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:22.040]  then it just gets wilder from there.
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:27.360]  Medical science knows all about this but they suppress information about preglonone.
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:32.920]  We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals
[1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:34.280]  in real red pill.
[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:37.240]  Real red pill plus has some added energy as well.

[1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:51.280]  The real red pill and real red pill plus, 65% off with a free bottle of Biotruce Selenium

[1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:01.920]  We're closing out the year 2019.
[1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:05.120]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be maker to break it.
[1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:08.320]  Not just for Info Wars, not just for America but the whole world.
[1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:12.760]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post-human world and those that
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:13.760]  want to pro-human world.
[1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:19.400]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst us mortals
[1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:24.960]  but it's being directed from on high and I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast.
[1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:28.120]  Without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[1:31:28.120 --> 1:31:31.920]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important Info Wars is and
[1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:36.680]  what we've done together and to just take stock and take measure at the end of the year
[1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:41.160]  and think about what you're going to do whether supporting Info Wars or buying products from
[1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:47.400]  us or starting your own show, just whatever you do, take action now, history is happening.

[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:00.280]  Info Wars doesn't have an audience.
[1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:05.640]  We have listeners, men and women who bleed red blood, who are part of the human race
[1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:11.400]  of every color, of every creed, who understand that evil is launching its full attack upon
[1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:16.640]  humanity now and who are ready to stand and fight against the globalist scourge.
[1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:21.280]  And I need all of you to realize that you're the best we've got, Info Wars is the best
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:22.280]  we've got.

[1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:33.400]  ever to stay on the air, not just to expand in the face of the enemy but just to stay
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:34.400]  on air.
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:39.000]  So I'm telling you right now, I need you to step into the plate, go to infowarstore.com
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:42.760]  and get great products that you all ready, really need.

[1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:10.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:17.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:19.360]  the Info War.
[1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:31.200]  The future is now.
[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:35.400]  They had us as number one on Droid, number three on Apple and we went back to get screenshots
[1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:38.040]  because our number showed us number one and we're gone.
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:41.800]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:47.400]  What users want from us and what we've always provided them is a curated plan, if you're
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:49.040]  going to curate.
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:55.360]  Let me tell Tim Cook something, we're watching you and what you're doing.
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:59.320]  Infoworth is steps ahead of the globalist and their censorship agenda.
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:02.640]  Getting ready to launch the next few months, new apps.
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:07.120]  Now it's easier than ever to have banned.video on your iPhone.
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:10.480]  Simply go to banned.video with your Safari browser.
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:13.720]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:16.960]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:21.400]  You will now have banned.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:22.640]  tried to stop it.
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:26.800]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:28.480]  Be sure and share banned.video.
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:40.560]  By the way, if people ask why I'm so crazed, I've only had like two cups of coffee today.
[1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:44.040]  When the globalists are breathing down my neck and messing with me and pulling dirty
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:48.680]  tricks and they're doing to the country, it doesn't scare me.
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:51.960]  It makes me get hired in a kite.
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:58.360]  I mean, I'm in ass stomping mode and I know you are as well.
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.880]  It's called the animated contest of liberty.
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:07.280]  My only problem is I want to work 24 hours a day and the infrastructure isn't even big
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:08.280]  enough for that.
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:12.760]  And that's why I'm fighting to get more capital in here and why I'm begging you for the sake
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:15.080]  of yourself, your family and my family.
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:19.280]  We're in this together, baby, baby, I love you, God, I love the audience.
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:22.080]  We are the people fighting for the future.
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:27.320]  And we have already kicked their ass up and down the block and we're going to do it again.
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:30.840]  I've been on air 25 years and I've seen the changes.
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:34.880]  I've seen us come from nowhere to contending to take the planet back.
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:39.000]  And I'm talking about you when I say we.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:48.120]  I want to go right back to your calls for them to make this as succinct as I can.
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:55.120]  When the globalist lie about you in the newspaper, when they tell these incredibly false stories,
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:02.520]  whether it's Trump or myself or others, it's because they want to create a false narrative
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:03.520]  of who you are.
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:08.840]  And you're like, wow, Alex, you just told me that green lights are green.
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:09.840]  It's very profound.
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:10.840]  Exactly.
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:11.840]  It is very profound.
[1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:19.800]  Now let me walk through it because the narrative, the real narrative of info wars, a guy on
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:23.440]  access TV 25 years ago, I'm 45.
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:29.920]  I've been on air since I was 20 and getting a local radio show and it getting top ratings
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:33.760]  right away because people wanted the truth.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:39.200]  The seed fell into good soil.
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:40.200]  It's not my success.
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:42.000]  It's our success.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.120]  It's the fact that people want freedom.
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:51.480]  They want justice and that from access TV with people supporting each other and believing
[1:36:51.480 --> 1:37:01.080]  in a better future that we've come this far and that info wars audience is responsible
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:08.640]  for about half the global awakening we're seeing right now, at least half of it, half
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:10.600]  of the globalist in trouble everywhere.
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:15.480]  Their satanism, their pedophilia being exposed, their anti-human agenda, their post-human
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:19.800]  system.
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:26.320]  The knowledge about their plan was only known by FBI agents in military brass and intelligence
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:30.080]  operatives and some Christians who were doing research.
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:39.800]  Only 1% of the public knew this stuff 25 years ago and I simply took what was known and some
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:43.680]  of it I couldn't believe it was so unbelievable and then it turned out what those people were
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:50.840]  saying was dead on and I'll just say who the groups were.
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:51.840]  People criticized them.
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:52.840]  They hate them.
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:59.040]  Some people love them but it was FBI type people, former NSA people, military people,
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:04.320]  former high-ranking FBI agents and a lot of Mormons, people say look at the LDS and it's
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:05.320]  corruption at the top.
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:06.320]  I'm sure.
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:07.320]  I'm not endorsing it, whatever.
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:09.240]  I'm just judged trees by its fruits.
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:15.720]  It was Mormons that knew all this stuff and Christians and evangelicals and folks that
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:22.440]  understood what was happening and man it turns out they, those people, Christians in general,
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:31.160]  a lot of right-wing Catholics were dead on about all this and so you have a grassroots
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:33.400]  Catholic person who's a great person, knows everything that's going on.
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:34.400]  The Pope's pure evil.
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:39.920]  Well, it's the same thing with a lot of these other organizations but that's why they have
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:46.240]  thousands of articles lying about me because they're scared of the archetype of a Texan,
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:53.560]  of an American, of a red-blooded person who's really genuine and really means to change things
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:58.800]  and has a pure heart.
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:04.040]  And they're scared of that idea of genuine people that are real and I can be a real
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:05.960]  a-hole too but it's real.
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:06.960]  It's not fake.
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:07.960]  It's not couched.
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:08.960]  It's not calculated.
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:09.960]  It's not a projection.
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:16.200]  It's not a manipulation because I respect myself a lot because I have will.
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:17.840]  Because I have a connection to God.
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:24.360]  Will is a connection to God and it's how much of that you got and I see you made by God.
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:26.360]  I respect you.
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:31.560]  You're incredible and I'm not going to sit here and watch these people screw these kids
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:36.760]  up anymore and their potential because God made those children for incredible purposes
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:41.200]  and I'm pissed.
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:46.360]  And so that's why these people want to sit there and say we're not genuine and we're
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:49.600]  not real and we lie and we manufacture stories.
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:53.000]  It's all crap.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.840]  But I'm not talking about this to defend myself here.
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:04.680]  I'm talking about it to understand their attack.
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:06.600]  You understand their attack on yours truly.
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:10.320]  You understand the attack on you.
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:17.040]  So they can't deal with the reality that the grassroots is where the power is and from
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:18.600]  it comes the resistance.
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:23.400]  You couldn't write a Hollywood movie about a resistance to a global government technocracy
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:31.400]  and the resistance coming out of where you'd expect it to.
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:36.000]  Because all those movies and things were just images of archetypes people had already seen.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:41.160]  So they have to discredit that victory we've had together, that huge global awakening and
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:46.520]  turn it into something about Sandy Hook or a pizza place to say there's no pedophilia
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:52.600]  going on as distractions to make that my identity, to make Americana and the populace Christian
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:57.360]  awakening about those little things that we hardly ever even talked about so they can
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:02.000]  distort that and make that our identity to make us change the subject and defend ourselves
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.800]  on those identity points that aren't us.
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:10.040]  I'll never talk about those things again if I'm not forced to because they don't matter.
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:15.880]  It's what the enemy has chosen to brush over what we've done to remove what we wrote on
[1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:16.880]  the wall.
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:23.120]  So they can write something there and say that that's what we wrote and steal our identity
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:29.520]  because everything the Satanic system does is steal identity.
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:36.360]  And so we've done incredible things together and when I say that I don't mind being persecuted
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:41.360]  for the truth because you expect to be persecuted for the truth.
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:45.840]  But instead of just taking it and being able to deal with it, I have begun to rejoice in
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:46.840]  it.
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:51.080]  Doesn't mean I don't fight it hard, doesn't mean I'm not totally focused, but beginning
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:42:03.800]  to understand that that is a real sign of the victory and that that's a good thing.
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:09.400]  Not just something we tolerate, but that that's what we should expect and that they're failing
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:13.960]  in their narratives and they're failing in their lives and that we have to celebrate
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:19.480]  that America is great and humanity has great potential and that we can reach for the stars
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:23.280]  and do so many things together instead of all those Democrat candidates up on the stage
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:27.160]  last night telling us how much we suck and how bad we are and how we're all done and
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:29.000]  how we're pathetic.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.920]  It really is morale that's going to turn this around, but morale for celebrating the right
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:37.600]  things and we're going to do it and we're going to win together.
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:42.240]  I just want to salute you and thank you and just tell you how amazing you are because
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:46.480]  in you realizing that is the victory.
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:51.320]  You haven't even begun to fight yet, I haven't begun to fight.
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:56.200]  We're getting stronger, the enemy's getting weaker.
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:42:59.560]  Info Wars has delivered.
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:06.200]  Info Wars has come through time and time and time and time again at that critical game
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:15.120]  changing moment we have come through and that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists,
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:21.760]  the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:23.520]  There is no top, there is no bottom.
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:29.560]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen and the stakes have never been higher.
[1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:31.800]  That's what the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:35.600]  Only you keep Info Wars in the game.

[1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:09.560]  I'm not playing around, I'm not screwing around, I'm not joking and neither are you.
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:15.280]  Info Wars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for
[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:20.600]  our children and the unborn, has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:24.760]  and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:32.400]  What we're doing is beyond critical and you hear the key word, what we are doing is beyond
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:33.400]  critical.
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:40.120]  So, this is the time with the biggest sales ever during Christmas at infowarstore.com
[1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:44.440]  to get in there and buy these products that you already need, that I need the funding
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:47.920]  for to get this operation to the next level.
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:49.440]  I need the money.
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:51.680]  I need to be able to fight the globalist.
[1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:53.000]  I need you.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:57.080]  You need these products, get them at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:03.880]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:04.880]  sweater.
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:09.480]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:14.920]  about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:18.160]  children to compromise world leaders.
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:24.040]  They do not want this story continuing and this is your last chance to get the limited
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:28.840]  edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:30.840]  history and to fund our operation.
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:34.440]  So, again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein.
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:37.040]  These things don't hang themselves on the front.
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:41.600]  On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars as a wreath.
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:43.240]  It's also a noose.
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:46.920]  The system can't stand it when you promote things to the grassroots level.
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:51.240]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:47:00.320]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today at infowars.com.
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:17.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:26.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:30.680]  This is the full assault on the president, that's why they're going to have the main
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:36.120]  line evangelical organizations founded by the grams, but not under their control, move
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:37.720]  against the president.
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:41.120]  All the blackmail, all the threats are being used.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:48.960]  Last 50 years, they created their tax exemption systems to trick churches to no longer be
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:52.480]  churches separate from government under the First Amendment with no government regulation
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:53.480]  allowed.
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:57.600]  That's why I hope the Indians can take peyote because it's their religion, literally, they
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:47:58.600]  can prove it.
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:47:59.600]  Springport City can do it.
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:03.640]  That's why Christians, some bizarre sex, can dance around with rattlesnakes in Arkansas
[1:48:03.640 --> 1:48:07.600]  and get bit by them because that's their right of their religion.
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:10.680]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting their
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:11.680]  exercise thereof.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:17.120]  But you know they're making their move on Trump now in Christianity today, says Trump
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:20.720]  should be removed from office and says our founding documents Billy Graham explains that
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:24.840]  Christianity today will help evangelical Christians interpret the news.
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.720]  So now they make their move.
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:30.960]  That's what you get for him trying to get rid of abortion and support mistakes, getting
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:38.720]  rid of it and go into pro-life marches, something no president, even Ronald Reagan would do.
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:44.320]  Hey guys, battery went out on this headset, it's doing that thing it does when the batteries
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:45.320]  go out.
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:49.360]  So I need to go do one on that side, thanks a lot.
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:52.520]  I know I think I'm going to retire these wireless units, they don't work anymore.
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:55.040]  Let me just have a go ahead and cut me up live on here.
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:57.840]  I'll go ahead and take one of the wired ones, thank you.
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:00.880]  I'm done with these, they don't work anymore.
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:11.320]  Anyways, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, they are making their move and that's what
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.840]  all of this is.
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:27.720]  And it's only going to get worse until we realize it and it really is astounding that
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:41.120]  Trump has stood up for the right to religion in this country.
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:48.440]  Trump has stood up for the unborn babies and gone in and gotten rid of the regulations
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:53.360]  that are in constitutional, controlling what churches can say and do when the media defines
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:59.040]  it as political, when conservatives say they're pro-gun or pro-life or they don't want so-called
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:05.280]  sex education going on in the schools.
[1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:10.360]  And Trump says, yeah, people have a right to their free speech and then you get a group,
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:11.360]  an organization.
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:12.360]  Thank you, Matt.
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:19.240]  You get a group, an organization like Christianity Today coming out and saying, you know, Trump
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.720]  is basically of the devil, get rid of him.
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:32.640]  Well, as Jesus Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:38.000]  And Hollywood, the New World Order, the globalists, the chicoms that have killed 100 million
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.520]  people and put Christians in concentration camps, they're all against Trump.
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:53.400]  And now one of the evangelical groups has done just that as well.
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:55.640]  Weirdest thing, we got these wireless transmitters about three months ago.
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:57.640]  They worked really great.
[1:50:57.640 --> 1:50:59.520]  Nice units from Switzerland.
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:04.960]  And then all of a sudden now they just go like that and then the audio cuts out all
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:05.960]  the time.
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:10.160]  And they've even got a new unit thinking it was that and it must be RF in here or something.
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:11.680]  But these are officially retired.
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:15.600]  I've dealt with this the last few weeks and it's distracted the living hell out of me.
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:17.040]  So say goodbye to those.
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:18.720]  I don't know how I'm going to walk around.
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:20.800]  I'm going to go with a headset.
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:22.680]  We'll just go with a headset wireless system.
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:23.680]  Look at the answer.
[1:51:23.680 --> 1:51:24.680]  I'll go online.
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:25.680]  I'll buy some.
[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:26.680]  It's no big deal.
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:27.680]  I'll figure it out.
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:28.680]  All right.
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:30.280]  I said I'd take a lot of calls.
[1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:31.280]  I haven't so far.
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:33.600]  I apologize.
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:37.280]  But we've covered a lot of really key news here and gone through a lot of important clips.
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:42.360]  I do intend to try to move as quickly as I can now to your phone calls Bob and Lewis
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:47.880]  and Chase and John and Mark and Al killer and Carlos and another George and Daniel and
[1:51:47.880 --> 1:51:51.400]  everybody who's been holding the longest here.
[1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:54.680]  I guess that would be Bob and Oregon Bob.
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:56.680]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:51:57.680]  Welcome.
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:58.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:58.680 --> 1:51:59.680]  Thanks for taking my call Alex.
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:02.200]  I'll try to make this quick out of respect for your other callers.
[1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:06.800]  I think the way that we defeat and prevent Trump from being removed from office is to
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:11.240]  fully engage what Nixon family C point the silent majority.
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:14.120]  And I think the best way to do that is to combat mind control.
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:18.080]  What's interesting is I really think the overwhelming amount of mind control is being
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:19.080]  done by the left.
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:22.840]  And one famous way they do that and talk about it all the time is information control.
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:23.840]  My gosh.
[1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:28.760]  If Trump isn't ready now now is if ever the time to go after Internet censorship.
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:32.040]  You talked on and on about how he hasn't done it for some reason.
[1:52:32.040 --> 1:52:36.280]  I mean now if anything just to get all the information out so that we can all the channels
[1:52:36.280 --> 1:52:40.040]  so that if we're going to remove a president let's have a free open discussion on every
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:42.120]  single Internet format possible.
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  Oh yeah.
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:48.840]  They're clearly they're clearly team Trump up to remove him right now.
[1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:53.200]  And yes they're they're just shredding due process our systems.
[1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:59.200]  The Supreme Court has ruled before that the House cannot hold up votes for appointments
[1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:06.960]  of judges or anybody else with with any controls over Senate procedure.
[1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:11.560]  Well I mean we already know that but we have Nixon versus the United States dealing with
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:16.480]  the impeachment last time and law professors are clear liberal and conservative.
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:18.560]  So what Pelosi is doing is illegal.
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:21.640]  But why doesn't she get her ass impeached.
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:23.640]  She's literally wants to be the president.
[1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:26.600]  They're now saying they're going to remove Trump and Pence and then who's that makes
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:27.600]  the president.
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:29.320]  I heard the president brother.
[1:53:29.320 --> 1:53:30.320]  Yeah right.
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:34.160]  I mean I think through freedom of speech we need to get aggressive and be on the attack.
[1:53:34.160 --> 1:53:37.320]  The other two points I was going to make really quick is that the same time that we
[1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:41.280]  need to free up the Internet I think that we need to engage our fellow human beings
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:44.520]  to get away from the Internet and have more human to human contact.
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:49.880]  Let's have let's get together with our neighbors but share ideas and not rely only on the Internet.
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:53.400]  One thing I talked about on my last time I called you was one of the permissions effects
[1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:54.400]  of the Internet.
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:58.040]  One of them on the free speech is it used to be back in the old days that you had to
[1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:01.840]  attend a lecture to first find out what the person was saying.
[1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:04.040]  Then you would get informed and then you can have a debate.
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:05.040]  It's a two way streak.
[1:54:05.040 --> 1:54:08.480]  A lot of the kids these days think you know what I already know everything I need to know
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:13.120]  about this person but only true human engagement is let's show up and shut somebody down.
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:16.640]  I think we need to stop being filled being shut down get away from the Internet a little
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:19.360]  bit more have true human to human contact.
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:22.480]  The very last point I wanted to make is I think the most permission thing that's going
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.080]  to actually implode on the left is they practice mind control through cognitive dissonance.
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:33.600]  There's maximum stress being created where if you like Trump you're a white male supremacist.
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:35.800]  You're not part of the woke generation.
[1:54:35.800 --> 1:54:37.480]  You don't care about human rights.
[1:54:37.480 --> 1:54:38.720]  You're a racist.
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:41.800]  That's created so much cognitive dissonance people are saying oh I don't really think
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:45.880]  I support Trump because I'm too afraid to say that's going to implode in my face.
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:51.920]  I feel like there's this big dam of people who love Trump who are sick and tired of being
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:55.880]  called all these labels all these racist names and I think that's going to self-implode
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:56.880]  on them.
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:00.920]  You're absolutely right sir and the dam is already broken.
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:04.240]  People are coming out of their shell because there's never enough political correctness
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:06.600]  or virtue signaling that's going to satisfy the left.
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:10.200]  It only encourages them to bully and dominate and control more.
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:11.600]  Thank you so much for the call.
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:12.600]  Excellent call.
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:16.960]  We're going to go to one more call but since he mentions this from Hollywood to Silicon
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:21.520]  Valley the Justice Department is backing corporate giants.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:26.480]  Trump is allowing Hollywood, his big enemy and Big Tech, his huge enemy to do things
[1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:31.720]  that are way, way worse than Standard Oil or AT&T or Microsoft.
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:35.040]  They need to be broken up.
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:39.440]  Big article right there breaking that down.
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:45.280]  That ties into this Big New York Times article oh 20 years after we tell everybody with the
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:49.520]  engineering specs and the New York Times wrote articles saying Jones is crazy 10 years ago.
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:54.800]  He thinks people listen to you or track you with your phone I mean it's a fact but now
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:57.840]  they're telling you did you know that the companies all track you and sell the data
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:03.560]  and they can tell everywhere you go what you do and that anybody can get into it?
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:08.320]  The privacy project 12 million phones, one database, zero privacy, one little database
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:12.360]  the New York Times bought for peanuts and this is their cover story.
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:14.680]  The New York Times does exactly what News Corps does.
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:19.320]  They hack into your phones, they track you in live time and when I talked about the harassment
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:24.680]  I've gone through from media these are intelligence agencies so I've had to change my cell phone
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:30.360]  six times okay and I'm going to leave it at that but let's just explain this they don't
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:35.920]  need PIs to follow you and it's not like I'm doing anything wrong but they identify who
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:42.040]  I talk to where I go then they have PIs approach and then process servers people that know
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:45.560]  me and then they threaten them first they offer money then they threaten them if they
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:47.040]  don't lie about me.
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:49.800]  So you understand the New York Times only putting this out to try to gain credibility
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.440]  because they have none but if you understand they're also covering their ass they've been
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:58.440]  using these databases they go oh we've been tracking Trump yeah you've been tracking everybody
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:04.000]  for SHIF so they're trying to get out ahead of this when you read this article you think
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:08.760]  oh my god the New York Times bought a database they've been tracking Republican leaders and
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:13.640]  talk show hosts remember SHIF was tracking all those journalists they're doing it with
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:25.440]  private intelligence groups and I was briefed over a year ago on the issues of this and
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:29.760]  these people are out of control folks these New York Times reporters and others go around
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:39.000]  with a phone or with an iPad live time stalking you they are organized criminals you understand
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:42.520]  on the payroll of an international narcotics trafficker we'll be right back stay with us
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:48.400]  your calls are straight ahead so what's the most important part let's say in a bulldozer
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:53.240]  running over the globalist the treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's all
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:57.920]  very important but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegory.
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:02.680]  Parabophorse is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:07.120]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:10.520]  system metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of them some people get about
[1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:14.400]  eight hours but people take this people taking sports people cannot believe it's the best
[1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:20.720]  they've ever had because it's not high nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts
[1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:24.360]  their post workouts you can call us whatever you want it's it's a it's a total solution
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.000]  all around the best you're gonna find.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  Parabophorse without you we don't roll with you we search forward together it's like a
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:35.320]  bulldozer without the diesel fuel if we don't have your financial support we will be defeated
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:38.920]  you support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your mind it's a
[1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:46.840]  win-win 360 together infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:58:46.840 --> 1:59:04.040]  My fault I fear I thought that you'd want what I want I'm sorry my dear but where are
[1:59:04.040 --> 1:59:11.600]  the clowns we are back live sending the clowns I thought about not even getting into the
[1:59:11.600 --> 1:59:18.560]  New York Times story don't bother there.
[1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:23.280]  The globalists have sent in the clowns they've sent in antifa they've broken our borders
[1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:27.200]  with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world they've tried to poison us
[1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:32.800]  with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines they've sent in their clowns but now the men
[1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:37.680]  and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere and I'm
[1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:42.360]  so proud of Info Wars leading the charge but the only way we can do that is when you keep
[1:59:42.360 --> 1:59:45.520]  spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at
[1:59:45.520 --> 2:00:06.840]  infowarstore.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:13.200]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:20.880]  Alright I'm going to write back to your phone calls but in the last segment of this hour
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:27.360]  I'm going to get into how big media is really anti-American anti-free speech globalist takeover
[2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:32.800]  arms how they spy on you how they track you now their main job is harassing you and harassing
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:37.880]  your family harassing people you work with and trying to get people to bear false witness
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:42.160]  against you and then scaring people because nobody knows how these reporters and their
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:46.280]  operatives know where you are where you're going and they've got your cell phone data
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:50.880]  every few seconds it's pinging back where you're at they've got the database and they're going
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:55.280]  in in live time and following you and the New York Times has come out and reporting on
[2:00:55.280 --> 2:01:00.920]  this because they know that it was about to come out very soon what they were doing so
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:05.240]  now they're going to go oh it's part of an investigation that's what people that always
[2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:15.920]  get caught with child porn say they go oh I was looking at it to research it you crooks
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:19.800]  dirty crooks and it doesn't even mean that people writing these articles even know that
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:24.840]  they're just like hey get on this and do this 20 year old story now because you know it'll
[2:01:24.840 --> 2:01:32.080]  show we have credibility with the youngsters no they've got the databases because they're
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:40.200]  tracking you and what they do is they match the databases up with NSA databases then they're
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:44.720]  told what database to buy and then they've got your name they've got your number and
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:49.480]  then they can hand that off to hackers other people they get into your phone so the New
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:54.840]  York Times is an organized crime unit you have to understand that committed to the destruction
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:02:01.880]  of this country and your family period total war all right let's go ahead and go back to
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:09.600]  it Carlos in Canada thank you for holding her on the air sir thank you Alex Estes and
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:20.280]  fuego yes sir go ahead Alex I'll call you earlier last a few days back because Hernandez
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:29.520]  was assaulted as you know an idea struck me perhaps a safety vest could be worn by a cameraman
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:35.640]  you know when the cameraman is interview is filming an interview they record any assault
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:43.160]  perhaps a cameraman could be wearing a vest a safety vest that says assault will be prosecuted
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:48.480]  to the full extent of the law warning or something like that so that so that those that are being
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:52.600]  interviewed are looking at the cameraman and they're looking at the interviewer will be
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:57.480]  aware of the fact that they'll be prosecuted if they engage in violence I was just an idea
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:03.760]  at the time well I know my security guys have tried to get me to wear a bulletproof vest
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:10.520]  and to me it's like wearing shark mail when you go swimming around the ocean I mean you
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:18.320]  know your chances aren't that high I think it gets shot but really what it is is people
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:23.440]  throwing things at you hitting you and the police doing nothing but yeah I mean they
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:28.320]  shouldn't be attacking female reporters even when they don't have info or smites all just
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:32.320]  because if you argue with them in any way they start physically attacking you it's a
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:37.320]  lot bigger than them attacking us it goes to the mindset of these people across the board
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:42.920]  are a bunch of spoiled rotten little chicken neck wimps they're not warrior class and and
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:46.760]  so that the warrior class wouldn't start fights because they understand it means you're going
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:50.840]  to get attacked back so you better pick your battles you better have moral high ground there's
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:57.480]  nothing like the toddler spoiled rotten pervert class now wanting to have a war the worker
[2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:02.720]  ants with the warrior ants it's really a stupid move but the warrior ants have been so subdued
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:07.200]  because we're here to protect the sheep but what do you do when the sheep are working
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:12.800]  for the wolves I mean it's it's it's become a real crisis I think a warning that there
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:16.760]  should be that they will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law should be something
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:20.440]  they should be aware at the moment that they're being interviewed that will discourage them
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:24.160]  from engaging because they're being filmed you see and and they'll be they'll be aware
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:29.440]  of it the next thing I want to talk you about briefly is just Hillary Clinton stay there
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:36.240]  back in 60 seconds I want to talk about her Hillary because I mean I didn't just theorize

[2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:06.640]  war and screaming at the globalist to their face in the streets and halls of congress
[2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:15.160]  the mountains and the valleys of this country and other nations now there's big stories

[2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:28.000]  blindsided by the fact that i research i'm somewhat informed so are you and she think
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:32.600]  oh everybody knows the house is just an impeachment that's just an indictment but no large portions
[2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:37.400]  of americans in major polls got articles up on info wars dot com people can questionnaires
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:42.420]  on the street believe he's been removed they believe he's been convicted well the supreme
[2:07:42.420 --> 2:07:49.840]  court ruled years ago multiple times that you can't do what Pelosi did in a congressional
[2:07:49.840 --> 2:07:57.600]  process between the house and senate they can't demand rules be changed or they won't
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:02.400]  follow the constitutional procedure of holding up the impeachment but they don't care because
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:07.400]  it's a ruthless power grab like everything else these criminals do supreme court ruling
[2:08:07.400 --> 2:08:13.560]  knocks down Pelosi's impeachment demands the framers did not intend to impose additional
[2:08:13.560 --> 2:08:18.640]  limitations on the form of the senate proceedings the supreme court stated in nixon versus united
[2:08:18.640 --> 2:08:29.040]  states and they go through the fact that you cannot have the house telling the senate what
[2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:34.360]  they can do and the supreme court ruled in that in a federal judges impeachment and he
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:41.080]  goes through it the supreme court broke it all down i'm not going to read the whole article
[2:08:41.080 --> 2:08:48.160]  but people need to see this you need to read this very very important it's on news wars
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:59.680]  dot com and info wars dot com if you just joined us roger stone was in dc as an info

[2:09:16.800 --> 2:09:24.280]  setting up what he called the 45 group and he was approached by high level folks and

[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:36.080]  doing this this is a friendly warning he said that on air on the 20th 21st live feeds dc
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:41.520]  and he said and then your boy is going to be removed via impeachment and then they're
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:49.360]  going to get pinched everybody else and put polosi in well polosi wasn't in then she just
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:54.320]  been removed as a speaker but she was back two years later that was 2018 so they'd been
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:10:00.040]  positioning all of this and now here we are and we said this three years ago two years
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:05.600]  ago 11 months ago the reports are all in info wars dot com there's the headline for the
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:09.920]  live feed today with all the links and articles red alert deep state announces plans to remove
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:16.400]  pence after trump conviction install polosi 2017 info wars first broke the globalist plan
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:22.560]  to trigger an illegal impeachment causing a constitutional crisis that they would then
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:27.360]  demand the 25th amendment be invoked and now shifts been on tv saying it and they say we're
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:34.320]  going to put polosi in who will then appoint hillary as the vice president during the
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:41.200]  last months of the campaign she will then win being the elected president that's the plan
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:47.120]  they've got and polosi will then step down and they'll go don't be against it it's our
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:55.200]  first woman president and our second woman president i've talked to people that have
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:11:02.400]  been there in the meetings with hillary two years ago where she's in control of the democratic
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:08.320]  party and the big law firm in dc and all the people and they're running the whole plan
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:13.840]  and she's talking about shutting down the independent media buying it off it's all right there
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:20.080]  how she wants the polling companies bought off like last time how she wants all the
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:25.360]  democrats under her control she's directing the dnc she gets the money she's campaigning everywhere
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:30.160]  because she's going to come in at a broker convention and or appointed by polosi they've
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.000]  got many tracks to where they want to go and they're trying to do it doesn't mean they're
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:39.920]  going to succeed but it's criminal it's out of control it's unbelievable and it's incredibly
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:46.640]  riveting and interesting i mean there's not a boring moment in my life when you got these people
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:53.760]  breathing down your neck a lot of folks go well then you should stop you should back off that's
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:58.960]  dangerous think about yourself i came looking for a fight and and i don't say that to act tough
[2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:02.240]  i came to change things just like you did that's why he came to the show
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:07.680]  and if we're going to go up against criminals we want to clean clean the country out clean the
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:11.360]  town out i mean we're going to have to go out there at high noon and i mean this metaphorically
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:15.920]  just like i did with mewler and we're going to have to confront them in the town square
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:18.880]  with the spaghetti western music on in the background
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:26.400]  and they're going to come and you know the process of patriots being destroyed
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:32.320]  is what always brings them down mahogany letting men beat him in the head with clubs
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:35.920]  they're trying to march to the ocean and collect salt because the british government said you
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:43.600]  have to buy salt from us and he did what an army couldn't do by letting them split his head open
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:48.800]  so you ever see me getting my head split open or you see me in prison or dead
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:52.400]  they're going to say oh look at that loser they're going to put out i'm a bad guy i don't
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:58.640]  know about everybody no no i'm a winner and i can do a lot more letting them kill me
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:05.360]  than i can do with a gun and so i'm so violent i'm so aggressive
[2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:11.680]  that i'm willing to use the judo move and be destroyed myself in the process but you've got
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:20.800]  to know that that's a win you know how strong it is when you're a fighter to let somebody punch
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:27.680]  you right in the face plus somebody spit on you but you're winning when you do it now there's times
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:31.280]  when they're all coming for you and your family and your corner do you fight like hell then
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:37.440]  but when it's at the right time no one to hold them no one to fold no one to walk away no one to run
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:41.280]  that's when there's times to turn the other cheek
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:47.040]  there's other times to kick the money changers tables over and beat them with webs
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:51.680]  but you got to know when to hold them no one to fold them no one to walk away no one to run
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:56.080]  and you got to know when to swing for the fences got to know when to go for the jugular
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:02.400]  you got to know when to turn the berserker on turn on the juice and then turn on the power
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:09.360]  let's go back to carlo if you wanted to get into hillary you can see the prime positioning
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:16.240]  and it's it's it's it's quite a bold hutzpah filled move isn't it you said so much of what i was
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:21.920]  going to say but i will simply say that lin rott's child told her that she would make sure she would
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:29.280]  be president and so what chance does poor president uh trump have no let me tell you something
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:36.400]  my father once told me that evil is not intelligent so always be on the side of intelligence
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:43.920]  because if you do that you will probably see evil for what it is now having said that president
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:52.400]  trump is being handed by the intellect of the universe the card to play the russians interfere
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:59.280]  with the election anyone could interfere with the election anybody can hack the election anyone can
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:05.760]  give a driver's license to immigrants or illegals to vote millions can be produced out of thin air
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:12.400]  that that can vote three four five times the president of united states has a crisis coming up
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:17.200]  hillary clinton and impeachment process have just determined what will happen and i will tell you
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:25.600]  if he is outvoted by her candidacy if she declares and she wins the popular vote by 15 million 20
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:33.600]  million 30 million votes he will not be able to say well just i got the electoral college again
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:38.080]  he will have been impeached that will be the number one card she'll play throughout you've
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:43.040]  been impeached like my husband you are impeached she's not too intelligent the president can now
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:49.040]  make sure that the elections are not tampered with by the russians or the chinese or the democrats
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:56.560]  or anybody make sure that veterans the point attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've

[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:35.120]  not true it's total lie but you know that's just the way it is so we have a polar bear in studio

[2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:56.480]  you think's coming next with the whole impeachment hoax because it is a hoax now they're saying they
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:01.040]  may never send it to the senate they may wait you pass more articles and have to be an ongoing
[2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:07.280]  continual spectacle for months to come sure first off i just wanted to wish you a merry christmas alex
[2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:12.640]  for my family to you and yours and in force crew merry christmas
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:16.560]  merry christmas to you you've committed incredible thought did you hear that gorsuch said that on

[2:23:21.760 --> 2:23:26.880]  i'm not surprised i mean these um the democrats are criminal and i've been thinking about this
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:32.400]  a long time i i know trump has them terrified they're absolutely terrified when he goes after
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:38.000]  i'm looking at a hunter biden and all the actual crimes they had him off the pass with this contrived
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:44.400]  impeachment fiasco and so what they're trying to do is uh tie him up with that nonsense but then
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:48.800]  even if the senate doesn't confirm this and he gets tossed out they're going to say you know
[2:23:48.800 --> 2:23:52.880]  hillary could enter the race or anyone else and he can investigate investigate their crimes
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:57.280]  and go for prosecution and they're going to say well no you can't you can't prosecute us because
[2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:03.840]  we're political rivals and this is retaliation for the impeachment see we impeached you which
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:08.000]  they didn't say it would fail in the senate but even if it does fail they're going to say well
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:13.840]  this is retaliation this is the reason why you're prosecuting us etc this is their their strategy
[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:19.120]  and it's really hypocritical because they say no one is above the law except democrats no one
[2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:23.520]  is oh yeah whatever they do was whatever they do is the inverse thank you for holding great

[2:37:37.040 --> 2:37:44.560]  then chase john and kentucky thanks for holding go ahead hi alex first time caller welcome regarding
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:53.040]  the impeachment i've got a lot to spit out here and here's the deal we have a uh total fraud at
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:38:00.000]  least a double fraud that's been perpetrated upon the american people and uh what is the basis for
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:08.240]  their alleged impeachment is that uh trump was uh meddling with our election by bringing in foreigners
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:13.840]  is that correct yes sir and then it's the democrats are the ones that are doing it in the open
[2:38:13.840 --> 2:38:19.200]  with giant lines of illegal aliens who don't even have to pass drivers test from california to new
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:25.680]  york in front of everyone in fact roll the footage for tv viewers of this week of the lines of thousands
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:35.280]  of illegal aliens literally being worshiped as god go ahead sir okay can i go no i'm saying i agree
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:40.160]  with you you're right okay the foreign meddling is the democrats they are the globalists go ahead
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:45.920]  okay that's only the first element okay the second one is millie weaver's expose a
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:54.080]  uh last week or so when she had the little 34 minute section where uh she's wearing the purple
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:39:03.280]  dress or dark blue dress where we have a carrier i2 and sidle foreign agents foreigners counting the
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:12.800]  vote through those electronic machines now let's back up a second here we also have three due process
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:21.600]  of law violations or uh us supreme court cases that'll back up uh that this was a violation of due
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:28.720]  process of law the first one is her tato versus california then this is under article six clause
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:35.600]  two the u.s supreme court cases are the supreme law of the land so we don't need to go to the supreme
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:40.880]  court they've already decided this not this particular one but that's been decided in the
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:52.320]  past her title versus california is 110 us 516 and it starts on page 535 and then we have uh
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:40:04.400]  true acts versus corrigan 257 us 312 1921 case and then we have connelly versus general construction
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:14.960]  company which is 269 us 385 1926 case and so if you'll give me the time to read these the quotes
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:22.880]  out of the pertinent sections i'll do that now uh but uh before we even get into that we have
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:32.480]  an election that was done in 2018 this election in 2018 we didn't know for sure that it was a ripoff
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:40.960]  now with the millennial millies expose a multi millie weaver that 34 minute the document that
[2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:52.000]  she put out and with the uh the trap doors that are incital and carrier iq where the vote can be
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  rigged dozens of different times dozens of ways then the people that are sitting up there in the
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:06.240]  congress right now that are democrats are imposters they're fakes so that's fraud number one
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:15.520]  and then there's another case here called us versus throck morton that's 98 us 61 hey hey listen
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:18.640]  john you're bringing up a lot of really great stuff that you've been on about three and a half
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:22.320]  minutes i gotta get to everybody else because there's a lot of folks want to get on but listen
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:26.800]  we know about court cases they're important the democrats are a criminal group they're
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:31.280]  completely out of control all of what they're doing is illegal it's all confirmed supreme court
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:35.440]  cases you name it you're dead right they engage in total election fraud in all the cities they
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:39.920]  control we're in a crisis i appreciate your call uh and if you want to shoot a video and
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:46.080]  send it to us we'll probably play it or something we just it we need to get articles out i agree
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:50.160]  with you showing all those pieces of evidence and we need people to email it to the white house we
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:54.080]  need people to hand it to president trump you don't know how scared the globalist are of people
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:58.960]  giving trump stuff because he really cares about the average people and he goes and looks it up
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:04.720]  he's obsessed with magazines and articles and notes people give him and he just has boxes of it and
[2:42:04.720 --> 2:42:09.200]  when he's on the airplane he just reads it all voraciously because he doesn't want information
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:14.800]  control keeping him from getting information that's why so many times they've said my god
[2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:18.160]  they take what jones says word for word and put it in speeches which has been confirmed
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:23.360]  because they go and check what i'm saying and they research it and they they put it out because
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:29.680]  it's true so yes sir all right i will go to these calls for mike adam takes over george

[2:47:24.560 --> 2:47:33.280]  that's a positive thing we together have forced the new world order system out in the open they're
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:38.000]  having to openly defend world government they're having to openly defend the post human world
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:43.120]  they're having to openly defend defend their sacrament of pedophilia
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:50.800]  and the whole world is turning against them we have forced their system out in the open
[2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:55.520]  they were always so arrogant and thought they just incrementally put into place and
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:00.400]  people would forget the past and accept the tyranny but it's not happening all over the
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:05.520]  world by every metric they're losing we're winning and yes we were far down the rat hole and we're
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.720]  still in a lot of trouble but once we have the initiative and once we wake up and once we get

[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:22.560]  air thanks for calling hey thanks for taking my call merry christmas let's go over a list here nsa
[2:49:22.560 --> 2:49:27.600]  spying bundy ranch internet of things jeff riebski each state coup builder bird bohemian grove every
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:32.000]  deadly viruses and vaccines everybody support info wars they've been trying to give us the
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:37.360]  information for years in the front lines now alex i'm over here deep behind enemy lines in crazy
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:43.040]  california but thankfully i live in central california in a bubble of sanity of sorts congressman
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:48.720]  nunez is in my district right well friday night i attended an event hosted by congressman nunez
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:53.200]  where he laid out the case of spygate there was about a few hundred people there and i livestreamed
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:58.880]  the thing and here's the thing congressman schiff is releasing nunez's phone records in this recent
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:04.000]  committee hearing that was a direct shot at one of president trump's biggest supporters a direct
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:09.040]  abuse of the phisa court it's a massive harassment and again because they're not getting in trouble
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:15.280]  they're getting more criminal in front of everyone exactly right when you have the ranking member
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:20.560]  exposing the ranking or the chairman exposing the ranking member's phone numbers and a hearing
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:25.840]  like that i'm telling you uh what we just saw from ben there he is on to something because if
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:31.120]  congressman nunez goes on the attack himself and the president trump because they need to expose
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:37.520]  these deep state actors day by day they continue to abuse the constitution abuse american sovereignty
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:42.320]  and it's up to us americans to do something about it and all we can do is sound the alarm calling
[2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:47.200]  you heard what i got into with the new york times they're reporting how they bought a database
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:53.520]  of 12 million people and tracked them in lifetime because they have pings you know where those are
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:58.800]  it's beyond the database that's what they're all doing and it's big tech working with the deep state
[2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:02.720]  the democrats are the globalists they're working with big tech to overthrow the country and so
[2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:08.240]  this is beyond just anti-trust it's beyond censorship it's organized criminal racketeering
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:12.880]  what would you do if the mafia was getting private phone records to harass people it didn't show any
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:17.680]  corruption what would you do if the mafia was spying on the media you know the the controlled
[2:51:17.680 --> 2:51:21.840]  media spies on the real media they fear the people they fear independent media and you're

[2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:30.000]  shake that man's hand that's what we need to do when they're right when people make the right
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:34.480]  decision we have to let them know that we know what they're doing we're watching what they're
[2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:38.480]  doing and we also have to back them up and give that them that encouragement to make the right
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:43.200]  decision i totally agree and you know van drew what was was was such a well-spoken person that he
[2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:47.520]  won a republican district as a democrat he said listen my constituents don't like this trump said
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:52.720]  nothing wrong this is an attack on due process i'm fully pledging on dying support for the president
[2:53:52.720 --> 2:53:57.520]  and that's what we need is to break the trance of groveling to the system everybody hates the system
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:03.600]  in reality so kissing the system's ass is over hollywood the dc elite they're done and they're
[2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:08.960]  and they're trying to put on this big act right now but ruth bader ginsberg and polosi and nadler
[2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:15.040]  and all of them doddering around uh little satanic gremlins they are indicative biden could hardly
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:19.760]  talk the other night he barely talked and said that winston church hill was the oldest u.s president
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:26.400]  these people are a joke but they're but they've been in power and it's all coming down i have i
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:32.960]  have a story about uh the former vp that we could talk about offline but anyway um going back to
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:37.840]  what i was saying about the same thing goes for people like lindsay gramp the guy was a demon
[2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:43.920]  prior to his buddy dying now when he's making the right decisions when he's defending trump
[2:54:43.920 --> 2:54:48.080]  we need to let him know hey we and it goes for everybody in congress that we need to let him
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:52.640]  know you just hit the tree there listen most these people are followers and some of them would like
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:57.280]  to do the right thing they've just been slaves we're at the tipping point where we support people
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:02.240]  when they finally show a spine others will do it and we win god bless you great point we need to do
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:10.080]  it now now you're absolutely right and forgive people like christ did on the cross one guy didn't
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:16.080]  want to believe he could be you know saved the other person did and and just their heart was right
[2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:22.720]  and and it's it's never too late folks if you really mean it okay let's go to erin in kentucky
[2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:28.080]  you're on the air thanks for holding alex thank you so much for taking my call i've been listening
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:33.920]  to you since about 2006 when i first woke up and you kind of shook me and helped me to stay awake
[2:55:33.920 --> 2:55:39.360]  and i think that that same passion that you exude every single day on the air when you talk about
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:43.920]  how much you love life how much you have much you love christ how much you love liberty and your
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:48.320]  listeners and the people of america and people around the world that same kind of passion is
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:53.520]  what the democrats are trying to destroy right now because real men standing up and doing
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:56:00.080]  manly things like facing evil and facing adversity is the exact thing that they can't have if we have
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:06.080]  an army of info warriors an army of patriots and men that are dedicated to the lord jesus prize men
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:11.440]  who are fighting for values who are standing up to protect women and true femininity and true
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:18.160]  masculinity they can't stop that force so if we don't if we don't stand up now and if we don't
[2:56:18.160 --> 2:56:23.200]  fight with that same kind of passion then we're going to lose you see things like that christianity
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:28.720]  a piece that they wrote saying that trump has to be dismissed from office but those folks are who
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:35.920]  who give the evangelicals the the impetus to not fight in that situation they can love the
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:41.760]  evangelicals which a lot of great people are evangelicals the grass roots the best people
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:46.960]  but the leadership christianity today billy graham sun supports trump christianity today
[2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:52.720]  is not run by them these are globalists saying trumps bad that is devilish you judge a tree
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:57.760]  by the fruits trumps going after abortion trumps standing up the pedophiles trumps defending
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:03.840]  christian's rights and they're attacking it christianity today is a den of devils by their
[2:57:03.840 --> 2:57:11.200]  works you shall know them exactly and why is it that is that the democrats can abort millions of
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:15.840]  babies that they can say that there are over a hundred genders that they can say that men are
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:21.520]  able to have babies now but christianity today is silent they don't say a word about it but because
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:26.800]  orange man bad he says something hurt my feelings they write an editorial stay there i'll come back
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:32.400]  to you briefly here's why trumps not a hypocrite he's never ran around in bible thumps he's not
[2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:36.960]  going to do it now but he believes in god and he's standing up for freedom he's not a hypocrite god's
[2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:41.920]  using him he's real exactly christianity today is the type of people christ would have beaten in the
[2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:56.560]  temple my fault i fear i thought that you would want what i want i'm sorry my dear
[2:57:56.560 --> 2:58:14.000]  but where are the clowns sending the clowns don't bother there
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:20.240]  the globalists have sent in the clowns they've sent in antifa they've broken our borders with
[2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:24.880]  some of the most hardened criminals from around the world they've tried to poison us with fluoride
[2:58:24.880 --> 2:58:31.360]  at gmo and the tainted vaccines they've sent in their clowns but now the men and women of america
[2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:36.240]  are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere and i'm so proud of info wars leading
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:40.720]  the charge but the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast
[2:58:40.720 --> 2:58:46.080]  and when you keep buying the great products at infowarstore.com i'm here to give the listeners
[2:58:46.080 --> 2:58:52.960]  of yours a project report in the next 60 seconds and here's the bottom line i'm not playing around
[2:58:52.960 --> 2:58:59.680]  i'm not screwing around i'm not joking and neither are you info wars and this operation we built
[2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:05.920]  together has delivered for america has delivered for our children and the unborn has delivered
[2:59:05.920 --> 2:59:13.200]  in the face of toxic fluoride and the gmo's and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation what we're
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:23.440]  doing is beyond critical and you hear the keyword what we are doing is beyond critical so this is
[2:59:23.440 --> 2:59:29.520]  the time with the biggest sales ever during christmas at infowarstore.com to get in there and buy
[2:59:29.520 --> 2:59:35.520]  these products you already need that i need the funding for to get this operation to the next

[2:59:42.240 --> 2:59:46.000]  get them at infowarstore.com
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:54.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:54.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  we are back live doing two more segments and mike adams of naturalnews.com takes over
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:26.240]  erin and kentucky i never did any of this formulaically i just believed in freedom and
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:31.120]  thought if we raise the alarm people would say no to a horrible evil anti-human system and it's
[3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:36.880]  starting to happen all over the world because of info wars and drudge report and so many other
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:41.200]  groups that have fought over the years people can criticize drudge for having some negative
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:46.240]  trump timers i think he did it to wake people up but he did good work in the past undoubtedly so
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:51.840]  that's why i give credit there but it's one of the grassroots doing that but it really was places
[3:00:51.840 --> 3:00:56.720]  like info wars and drudge early on that were supporting trump and you know info wars has
[3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:01.680]  been somewhat hung out to dry with the with the deep state attacks we've gone through by trump but
[3:01:01.680 --> 3:01:06.880]  trump surrounded he can't even get stuff done he can't even fire clapper because they won't follow
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:12.160]  his orders i mean he should fire a bunch of people he should indict people but he's still getting a
[3:01:12.160 --> 3:01:19.360]  lot done so we're thankful that said it is the energy of the show that we're not like mpr trying
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:25.200]  to put you in a trance that was effective to somehow it's grating it's obnoxious but it's a
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:30.080]  wake-up call like an alarm i don't think paul revere riding through the night saying arms to arms the
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:35.200]  red coats are coming one of the byland hoot by sea was probably sounded like a christmas carol it
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:40.960]  was you know sounded abrasive to get your ass out of bed and so yes that's where we are um you're
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:47.760]  making some good points anything else um yeah you know the what what i see of course you have to
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:52.720]  sound the clarion call we all have a responsibility to speak up for the truth and what people get so
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:58.800]  afraid of especially in this culture that we have now is the refusal to offend someone or hurt somebody's
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:02.560]  feelings now i'm not saying go out there and make fun of somebody or sure but once they do that they're
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:06.960]  breaking people's will and breaking the idea of communication period and turning us into a bunch
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:13.440]  of cult members exactly because we that that makes we become too afraid of what somebody else is
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:18.560]  going to think about us then we then we are about actually speaking the truth and if we look at the
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:22.640]  if we look at the model of jesus he did not have any fear about what anybody said about him of course
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:29.280]  he was god however he spoke truth regardless if followers walked away from him it it christ was
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:34.320]  an example and again i'm not saying hurt anybody christianity today i wish no harm against him
[3:02:34.320 --> 3:02:40.960]  but they're a fake church a fake group attacking standing up the Pharisees were always oh that person
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:44.720]  didn't do this perfectly or didn't pray permanently right but they didn't care about all these other
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:48.960]  evils going on and so christ went in and beat the money changers with a whip and that's what
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:55.600]  christianity today is saying trumps a devil support the democrats that is unbelievable evil and saying
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:03:01.760]  trump should be removed from office that's the desperate group in the deep state evangelicals
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:07.520]  are good people these aren't evangelicals these are globalist world council of churches cfr controllers
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:11.600]  and it's disgusting and it shows how desperate they are and shows they're launching their main attack
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:15.520]  thank you erin all right mark in wisconsin thanks for holding your own the air welcome

[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:58.560]  well with the economy and how the democrats are playing games dude by uh having uh fake
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:03.760]  homeless people sleeping under the viaducts dude here in milwaukee to show americans dude
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:09.360]  that trump's economy isn't really working when i actually went into some of these encampments dude

[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:47.440]  establishment he's not a conservative he's a populist wrecking ball and he's just what we

[3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:14.080]  became a trump supporter i guess during the election four years ago and
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:21.360]  he was you're saying hey i've you know converted over well but not to republicanism to populism
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:27.280]  common sense uh old-fashioned you know blue collar believed in america that's really what
[3:06:27.280 --> 3:06:31.680]  trump's doing and it's scaring the hell out of the establishment and we need a referendum
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:36.000]  and a renaissance the democratic party we need at least a two-party system in this country
[3:06:37.040 --> 3:06:42.400]  and we don't even have that anymore we have the neocons and the hardcore leftist globalist
[3:06:42.400 --> 3:06:46.000]  and then you've got the freedom caucus that people are trying to gun down at baseball games
[3:06:46.640 --> 3:06:54.080]  so that's what's happening and you were getting into uh how trump needs to take action
[3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:57.760]  trump go after congress is what it says what's your view on that mark
[3:06:59.600 --> 3:07:05.040]  you know we have one choice and it's obvious alex and i just want to know you know who's out here
[3:07:05.040 --> 3:07:10.720]  willing to carry out this country's constitutional mission i mean you know trump has done great
[3:07:10.720 --> 3:07:15.120]  things for this country don't get me wrong the economy has been good you know a lot of things
[3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:20.720]  bringing back americana but we don't need the businessman anymore we need the soldier we need
[3:07:20.720 --> 3:07:25.920]  the eisenhower we need the fighter and trump is starting to become a failure only because he's been
[3:07:25.920 --> 3:07:31.520]  too nice to these democrats i would have just rolled these two plotters up you know it's just
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:36.720]  like it just seems like most of the republicans in my state dude are too overwhelmed too satisfied
[3:07:36.720 --> 3:07:42.880]  to fight back if i were trump and i would sit there and say impeachment be damned calling for
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:48.320]  rex 84 i'm locking down the country i'm putting the military on the borders i'm stopping all travel
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:53.680]  dude for all these politicians and i'm smoking these democrats out with the marine and just taking
[3:07:53.680 --> 3:07:59.360]  control of this democrat too i wish trump sometimes was a dictator held the democrats calling one
[3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:04.960]  every freaking day the media are criminal and they're complicit with this treason and i would
[3:08:04.960 --> 3:08:10.160]  have arrested them just like lincoln did he arrested battlefield correspondence talent
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:17.120]  brother i love that passion because you're not lying down you're awake and you're not just screaming
[3:08:17.120 --> 3:08:22.240]  and yelling and saying racist racist or mindless programming points you're saying eloquent
[3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:26.480]  focus points about what's happening and about action i don't want authoritarianism you're a
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:30.880]  former mainline liberal i bet you were anti-war so am i trump's trying to get us out of all these

[3:08:37.680 --> 3:08:44.000]  be america again and they are so scared of this president showing us how good he is and you're
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:48.720]  right though his only failure is he's paralyzed by the lawyers and people in the white house telling
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:54.800]  him to take all this crap uh and it's it's dangerous god bless you mark please call back again

[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:17.120]  a sad thing to be in the most patriotic section in the 1700s and yet people hate trump well that's
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:23.040]  right for people that don't know other than virginia per capita road island was the largest
[3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:28.160]  on average group of volunteers in the fight road island was like a detonator in the revolution
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:31.360]  war and they're seeing that because you're a leader they're seeing it because they're scared
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:35.680]  a lot of them support trump too they're just can't believe they're seeing a man who'll wear
[3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:40.960]  his american colors when you when you fly info wars or you fly the trump colors man
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:46.560]  you're letting people know i support freedom and i'm not a coward okay i appreciate that a couple
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:52.960]  things i'll let you go let you go okay first one thing first of all the minister okay which
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:58.080]  that's the biggest thing i hope i won't tell you that and i'm going to say one other thing uh in the
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:04.800]  12th song which is a very very short song the last verse which is in the eighth uh uh verse it says
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:12.320]  the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted and at this particular time
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:18.960]  time we can see that the vilest men are exalted and the wicked are walking on every side so that
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:24.800]  is certainly a fulfillment of song number 12 we can see that going on right now the other thing
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:31.120]  i'd like to say is um i worked 32 years for that for the swamp i've been i had four years with the
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:37.600]  coast guard from 1971 and 75 to see a young guy and then i worked for another branch in the service
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:43.600]  and i did some uh civilian work with them i won't mention them because they're very close to where
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:48.560]  i live so take it from there if you do your geography you'll know the branch that i worked for
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:55.680]  but at any rate um i would just like to say this right as i leave you many people ask me many times

[3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:59.120]  my ear had worms in it i couldn't get it out with antibiotics to hold nine yards doctors
[3:21:59.120 --> 3:22:04.160]  nothing could happen drainage was disgusting it was totally disgusting i tried living defense
[3:22:04.160 --> 3:22:13.360]  clear it right up right up wow gone bam amazing what do you think about the impeachment well here's
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:19.600]  the problem i'm not an anti-trumper and i'm not uh i'm like carol flintay says a political atheist
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:25.360]  but i have a feeling and i hope i'm wrong that the guy's in i i think he's in on the whole show
[3:22:26.240 --> 3:22:32.080]  well he's certainly putting up with it and that's pissing me off well that's what i'm saying
[3:22:32.080 --> 3:22:37.760]  that's what i'm saying that it seems okay the biggest problem i have with it is you know uh
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:44.080]  stone's best friend jesus like everybody said all today you know you you know you're then by
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:48.880]  their fruits my best friend alex i couldn't do that to it couldn't keep him in the pen like that
[3:22:48.880 --> 3:22:53.200]  i'd get him out and he didn't do anything for the border for a long time and you know now he's
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:58.160]  starting to work on that and then and he did a lot of things he did great and i thank him for that
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:03.760]  and uh i don't think it's right to kill babies and i think you know that's wrong but i think he's
[3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:08.320]  in on it and i think he's in on well we're gonna find out i know this juliena son's trump said
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:13.760]  release the wiki leagues and he's leaving him in jail stone hasn't been there the signs doesn't
[3:23:13.760 --> 3:23:18.800]  need that and you know and that's why i think he's in on it well i'm saying is though so he
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:26.720]  he has failed that test on signs but on the case of stone stone hasn't been um given a
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:30.960]  sentence yet that's coming in february and that'll be the big test thank you sir uh interesting
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:34.880]  points all right mike adams of natural lose dot com we'll all be listening intently here in the
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:40.560]  last uh 40 minutes of the broadcast uh he's always got a big plate full of things he'll
[3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:44.240]  obviously be able to comment too on what happens if they do remove trump because now it's not a
[3:23:44.240 --> 3:23:49.040]  theory that we first broke they want to remove him and put polosian who will then appoint hillary
[3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:54.640]  as vice president it's all over the news these people are crazy mike adams well it's great
[3:23:54.640 --> 3:24:00.320]  to join you again alex and let me just start off by saying info wars nailed this as you started
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:05.120]  off a show today even years ago warning of exactly the scenario we're seeing unfolding
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:11.040]  of course i covered it too long ago we knew that there would be an effort to install polosi as
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:17.120]  president so that she could either maintain that office until the 2020 election and get hillary
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:22.400]  elected or just install hillary too by first naming her vice president of course normally that
[3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:27.520]  requires confirmation by the senate but the senate if if they roll over on this impeachment thing
[3:24:27.520 --> 3:24:33.360]  they'll roll over on anything so the senate is controlled right now that's another aspect of
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:39.200]  this that i've got to bring in part of the delay that nancy polosi is perpetuating right now is
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:47.600]  so that the nsa the black hat operators inside the nsa can continue to gather more blackmail dirt
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:54.000]  on gop senators to threaten them threaten their families and threaten their business associates
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:59.600]  with being exposed exposing their their emails their porn subscriptions anything embarrassing
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:05.520]  pictures family members all that they're all being threatened right now and nancy polosi is waiting
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:11.920]  to see if they can turn enough senators to get a conviction in the senate that's one strategy
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:17.520]  of many that she is pursuing right now and by the way let me take a little tangent from this
[3:25:18.480 --> 3:25:25.840]  ruth bader ginsberg is near death remember ginsberg and her her eminent death and we never
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:30.960]  wish death upon anyone but this is this is biology at this point with her she's got stage four
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:36.160]  pancreatic cancer and she's already undergone chemotherapy which itself is toxic and tends
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:41.760]  to accelerate fatalities you know the number one side effect of cancer is more of chemotherapy
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:46.720]  excuse me is more cancer and sadly she has undergone that it also damages the brain damages the
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:53.280]  kidneys and the heart and so on she is near death and so there is a sense of urgency to remove
[3:25:53.280 --> 3:25:58.480]  trump from office before he has a chance to appoint another supreme court justice or alternatively
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:04.240]  to tie him up under impeachment and then claim well you can't appoint a supreme court justice
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:08.800]  when you're under impeachment that's nonsense of course you can but they will argue that they
[3:26:08.800 --> 3:26:13.680]  will gaslight the country and they will try to prevent trump from doing that if this situation
[3:26:13.680 --> 3:26:20.480]  should occur the other strategy is to then dictate the rules of the senate to introduce new witnesses
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:26.640]  now you nailed this i think in on your show yesterday alex where they the democrats are
[3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:32.320]  demanding to introduce new witnesses into the senate hearings so they can introduce a january
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:40.000]  surprise which will be maybe four or five women who claim to have been raped by president trump
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:45.120]  now consistent with the whole whistleblower fiasco in the house you won't be allowed to
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:52.400]  know who these women are it's going to be the first anonymous rape victim witnesses in a trial at
[3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:56.640]  least that's what they will attempt will mitch mcconnell let them get away with that gosh we
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:27:01.680]  hope not we certainly hope not but right now they're getting away with everything they're
[3:27:01.680 --> 3:27:06.880]  violating the rule of law they've they've thrown every system of due process out the window and
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:12.480]  they are going to proceed until someone stops them they're going to keep gaslighting the whole
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:16.800]  country until they are stopped so don't be surprised if that's part of the strategy to
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:24.560]  have witnesses that claim trump rape them okay the next thing if they should succeed in removing
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:30.960]  trump from office and installing either polosi who can barely keep her own teeth in her skull at
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:37.600]  any given moment and talks like a like she's possessed by demons or has lost her mind i mean
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:45.360]  between joe biden and nancy polosi we are talking about a a neuropsychiatric phenomenon
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:50.080]  that is horrifying these people have lost their minds they can barely talk they can barely think
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:56.000]  they can barely speak and yet somehow they are running our country they are telling us what is
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:01.360]  no these people are are gone and they're all on Alzheimer's drugs by the way which is actually
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:08.000]  making their symptoms worse but if nancy polosi takes office what she's going to unleash will be
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:12.800]  so devastating so horrifying to america i'll cover the details on the other side of this
[3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:19.840]  coming break here on info wars you had better get ready because my prediction not calling for it
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:24.720]  but my prediction is there will be blood in the streets of america because under a president
[3:28:24.720 --> 3:28:30.080]  polosi or a president clinton there will be death squads to hunt down trump supporters
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:36.080]  conservatives christians and gun owners and they will not stop until you are dead in ditches
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:46.000]  all across america that's what i'll be describing when we return here on the alex jones show

[3:30:07.280 --> 3:30:12.400]  ditches and submit to them and they believe that if they can demonize and shut down info wars that
[3:30:12.400 --> 3:30:17.680]  they rightfully see as a symbol of beacon of populism and freedom not just to america but to
[3:30:17.680 --> 3:30:22.400]  the whole world that they can demoralize everybody else and win why they can shut info wars down

[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:49.680]  of truth and real journalism you know look if you go back to the last three years and you
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:56.560]  actually were to assess which news organizations in america got the stories right and which
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:34:02.560]  organizations got them wrong info wars comes out on top i mean natural news one of the most
[3:34:02.560 --> 3:34:08.560]  accurate news sources on the planet the gateway pundit accurate again and again bright part accurate
[3:34:08.560 --> 3:34:15.520]  guess who's been lying and and wasn't accurate new york times washington post cnn msnbc lying
[3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:21.680]  again and again and again fabricating false evidence fake witnesses fake anonymous sources
[3:34:21.680 --> 3:34:27.680]  fake leaks from the deep state i mean it's a it's a joke and yet they're called the real news and
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:33.840]  info wars is called fake news info wars has been absolutely correct nearly 100 of the time not
[3:34:33.840 --> 3:34:40.720]  exactly 100 a few few corrections here and there because nobody's perfect but as close to 100 as
[3:34:40.720 --> 3:34:48.320]  you can see whereas the the mainstream media maybe has had perhaps on the high end 50 of those stories
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:53.760]  are correct and the other 50 on lies and they're deliberate lies too with the media with new york
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:57.920]  times washington post their deliberate lies it's not like those are accidents they they do that on
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:05.840]  purpose all right getting to the topics i promise before the break so much to cover here here's what
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:12.000]  you need to understand so the democrats have completely abandoned the rule of law in this
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:18.480]  impeachment process which means that they no longer respect any rules of civil society now what are
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:23.760]  those rules i mean number one is the rule that we engage in elections and then we respect the
[3:35:23.760 --> 3:35:29.200]  outcome of those elections even if the person elected was not our person of choice so this
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:36.160]  election process or what's called a representational democracy this is a replacement for brutality
[3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:42.160]  and violence before democracy people decided who was in charge by just killing all the opponents
[3:35:42.160 --> 3:35:46.720]  or killing the political leader or just carrying out violent coups mass shootings and whoever ended
[3:35:46.720 --> 3:35:51.120]  up on top with the the biggest guns you know and the most troops well they were in charge
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:56.880]  that's most of human history right there that's kings throughout western europe for centuries
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:36:02.800]  and many countries today you know in in africa and central and south america in some cases even
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:08.320]  to this day but democracy and voting was supposed to replace that to say well guess what let's not
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:14.720]  just all kill each other let's have systems rules of law that we all agree to respect so that we
[3:36:14.720 --> 3:36:19.600]  don't have to result results in in this violence and we can simply elect people the democrats have
[3:36:19.600 --> 3:36:26.960]  abandoned that they've now said they they disagree with the principle of elections and by default
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:33.120]  they want to revert to brutality and violence and lawlessness now even though they are not
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:40.560]  uttering those exact words when you hear nancy polosi say that she is somber and she she's acting
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:46.720]  with love in her heart to protect the republic against the evil king dictator trump or whatever
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:52.080]  she says and she can barely say those words by the way without slurring at all what she's really
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:37:00.160]  saying is that she as a democrat now denies the existence of the rule of law rejects the outcome
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:06.320]  of elections and has decided to engage in brutality and violence in order to remove their political
[3:37:06.320 --> 3:37:12.480]  opponents so they can seize power and install an authoritarian regime a form of despotism
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:16.800]  to rule over the people and then commit violence against the people that's actually what she is
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:22.240]  saying even though those aren't the words that that she uses because you you either respect the
[3:37:22.240 --> 3:37:27.760]  rule of law or you have no rule of law whatsoever and they the democrats they have no rule of law
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:34.560]  they're lawless tyrants they are vile creatures they are traitors every last one of those 228
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:40.400]  democrats who voted for so-called impeachment in the house should be arrested and charged with
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:47.760]  treason today and and frankly william bar should do that today he should declare the democrats
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:54.800]  to be an illegal criminal coup uh or engage in a criminal coup an illegal criminal mafia
[3:37:54.800 --> 3:38:02.000]  organization a clear and present danger to the sustainability of this constitutional republic
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:09.040]  and our system of laws if the democrats will not respect those laws then they should be placed in
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:14.960]  prison and face charges for the sedition and the treason that they have actively conspired to carry
[3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:21.280]  out against these united states of america and at some point either william bar is going to have
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:26.640]  to declare that or perhaps the president might declare that or the american people are going
[3:38:26.640 --> 3:38:32.800]  to have to defend their republic against domestic enemies such as adam schiff jerry nadler and
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:38.000]  228 democrats in the house and and quite a few traders in the senate as well i'll talk about
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:45.040]  that more in a minute now i said all that to mention this if polosi were to gain power the
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:50.560]  oval office if they were to eliminate trump and eliminate pence and they could do that by gas
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:56.880]  lighting they could just say that they're out and they could say polosi is president what what
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:02.320]  would stop them what would seriously i'm asking you what would stop them no one stopped them so
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:07.120]  far a bunch of republicans trying to be polite hasn't stopped them from violating the rule of
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:12.480]  law shredding the constitution and impeaching or nearly impeaching the president with totally
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:18.240]  fabricated false evidence no one has stopped them so far what's to say tomorrow cnn just announces
[3:39:18.240 --> 3:39:23.600]  trump is gone pence is gone polosi is president most of the country would believe that
[3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:30.160]  and if fox news went along with it and maybe the washington post they would just gas like the
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:37.360]  country and people say well gosh polosi must be president and they would just have maybe an armed
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:44.000]  rogue wing of the pentagon go in with rifles and take trump out i mean physically remove him or
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:49.040]  perhaps assassinate him and then say polosi is president if that were to happen here's what's
[3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:57.520]  coming here's what's coming for all of you there will be mass criminalization of all trump supporters
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:03.440]  because it will be said that trump was an illegal dictator and that those who supported him were part
[3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:11.120]  of treason against america that was thankfully stopped by the democrat thank god for nancy polosi
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:19.120]  and her teeth she was able to stop america's coup by the evil dictator president trump you see
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:23.200]  just see how they project everything that they're doing every crime the democrats are committing
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:28.080]  they project on the trump and then they will they will say every gun owner in america who supported
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:34.480]  president trump and every christian who supported him and every voter who supported him is a co-conspirator
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:39.920]  in this illegal coup attempt to overthrow the united states of america and take it away
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:45.760]  from the democrats who are the legitimate rulers over this country this is what they will argue
[3:40:46.320 --> 3:40:54.240]  then they will use that to issue death squads and arrest squads nationwide they will run road
[3:40:54.240 --> 3:40:59.600]  blocks not just in virginia they will have roadblocks nationwide and they will profile vehicles
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:06.400]  looking for pro trump stickers perhaps info wars bumper stickers any kind of conservative bumper
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:11.280]  stickers gun bumper stickers if you have a bumper sticker like that they will pull you out of your
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:16.800]  vehicle if you resist they will put a bullet in your head and leave you in the ditch this is their
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:21.840]  ultimate goal this is what radical left-wing fascist regimes always do sooner or later the
[3:41:21.840 --> 3:41:26.720]  democrats always end up wanting to just commit genocide they want to just mass murder everybody
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:31.440]  who's a political opponent that's the only way they can maintain power and they have to target
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:35.600]  gun owners they have to target christians and trump supporters so this is exactly what will
[3:41:35.600 --> 3:41:41.600]  happen death squads will be unleashed nationwide they will attempt although i don't think they'll
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:46.800]  be very successful but they will attempt to go door to door executing prominent trump
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:53.360]  supporters confiscating weapons from all private citizens and spreading terror nationwide and in
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:59.760]  the meantime anyone who resists them will be labeled a terrorist so get this president pelosi
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:05.760]  will have terrorism death squads going door to door if you resist it you will be labeled a domestic

[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:21.440]  proceed at your own risk listening to the remainder of this segment this is mike adams
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:28.320]  here from natural news filling in for the rest of this hour on the info wars broadcast of the alex
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:33.040]  jones show we're going to talk about solutions because this is headed for a civil war it's headed
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:37.840]  for kinetic conflict and there will be blood in the streets sadly we don't want to see that but
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:42.560]  we know that the democrats will push america to that in fact it's part of their plan this is what
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:49.200]  they want and just to be clear part of what they want to call for is united nations occupation
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:55.280]  of america and in order to do that they have to whip up all kinds of violence and bloodshed
[3:47:55.280 --> 3:48:02.320]  for the cnn cameras so they can say look president trump has lost control or blame trump for the
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:07.360]  violence to say look he's an out of control dictator or he's tried to federalize the national
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:12.800]  guard of virginia for example proving he thinks he's a dictator and you're going to see mark my
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:20.720]  words iraq obama will call for united nations occupation and invasion of america at which
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:28.080]  point it becomes a full-blown guerrilla warfare scenario i'm going to give you some solutions
[3:48:28.080 --> 3:48:34.880]  of what you can do to survive the next year it's going to be perhaps the most chaotic year
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:41.360]  in america's history since the civil war and in many ways it may resemble the civil war so here's
[3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:47.600]  what's important i've done a lot of studying of publicly available information and it is my belief
[3:48:47.600 --> 3:48:54.400]  based on that research that the power grid will be taken down in many liberal cities once the
[3:48:54.400 --> 3:49:02.000]  civil war gets underway now i certainly don't advocate that anyone engage in taking down the
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:07.680]  power grid uh that is the vulnerability of cities that will take down cities and it'll take down
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:15.120]  google and and other treasonous institutions but the problem is many innocent people would die
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:20.720]  in that scenario as well this is not something i advocate but i do believe it will happen
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:27.520]  by others who are acting on on their own interests and as you know the power grid is not defended
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:35.040]  nationwide it is relatively simple unfortunately to take out power generating stations and power
[3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:40.720]  substations power distribution grids and so on what this means in a practical sense again once the
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:48.000]  civil war gets underway it means that many areas of the country will not have a functioning power
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:55.280]  grid or it will be functioning in a very um unreliable manner so this means you're going to
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:50:01.520]  have then total chaos in the cities because you're going to have the failure of food stamp transactions
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:07.840]  so there will be mass rioting and looting and arson because people who live in cities often
[3:50:07.840 --> 3:50:12.560]  like to burn down their own cities and no one's going to stop them by the way the police aren't
[3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:17.520]  aren't going to get involved in that firefighters aren't going to have the the manpower to do anything
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:24.080]  about it the cities will be engaged in total chaos at that point you want to be out of the city when
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:29.440]  that happens a half of survival is just not being there when bad things happen okay that's
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:35.440]  that number one is get get out of dodge before this happens the second thing you're going to need
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:42.560]  is obviously to be well prepared in terms of natural medicine basic first aid medicine some
[3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:49.280]  plant-based antibiotics that might be effective against infections and sterilization products
[3:50:49.280 --> 3:50:55.600]  such as povidone iodine and so on because it's actually infections that get more people killed
[3:50:55.600 --> 3:51:01.040]  in these collapsed scenarios than almost anything else even then gunfire more people die from
[3:51:01.040 --> 3:51:06.720]  infections than from being shot so yeah you should have your ar you should have your ghost gunner
[3:51:06.720 --> 3:51:13.760]  you know pistol or multiple firearms lots of lots of ammo for your defense but you should also be
[3:51:13.760 --> 3:51:17.840]  able to defend yourself against infectious bacteria because that's what tends to kill a lot of people
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:25.200]  in war zones as has been you know witnessed all around the world the the third thing that's crucial
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:31.200]  for this is you need to have a mindset that frankly most americans are not yet ready to accept
[3:51:31.200 --> 3:51:37.440]  a mindset of understanding that you are being hunted you are being hunted by the democrats
[3:51:38.000 --> 3:51:45.040]  they want to kill you you cannot negotiate with them you cannot appease them and there's no point
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:52.640]  in trying to be polite to them you cannot coexist with rabid hyenas and drooling zombie vampires
[3:51:52.640 --> 3:51:58.240]  that are trying to destroy everything including their own babies by the way i mean they they
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:05.040]  they cut their babies apart for body parts these people are insane they're criminally insane
[3:52:05.040 --> 3:52:09.600]  they're violent stop trying to think that you're going to reason with them you're not going to
[3:52:09.600 --> 3:52:14.320]  be able to do that if you don't get your mind right on this right now they will come for you
[3:52:14.320 --> 3:52:18.480]  they will kill you they will take your supplies they will dump your body in a ditch or just set
[3:52:18.480 --> 3:52:23.840]  your house on fire and burn up your corpse along with whatever they left behind if you don't have
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:30.080]  the right mindset here you will not survive this and i've you know i've trained with a lot of people
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:36.480]  who are former military i've worked as a you know i own a pretty large company and hire and fire
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:41.520]  people i've dealt with you know many thousands of people over the years and i've seen what is
[3:52:41.520 --> 3:52:47.280]  mentally strong and what is mentally weak and i tend to find by the way that veterans
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:54.400]  veterans are very mentally strong because they've seen what humanity is capable of veterans have
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:53:00.960]  been in the sandbox they've been there they've seen what happens they've they've seen the exploitation
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:06.640]  of of children to turn them into armed soldiers in afghanistan for example they've seen the human
[3:53:06.640 --> 3:53:12.800]  trafficking they've seen the desperation what happens when you lose a power grid when you lose
[3:53:12.800 --> 3:53:17.200]  all the the benefits of modern society they've seen this firsthand i'm talking about the the men
[3:53:17.200 --> 3:53:22.720]  and women that have served on the front lines and they have a mindset of survival the ones that
[3:53:22.720 --> 3:53:27.520]  can handle it you know a few soldiers can't handle it they they get extreme ptsd they break
[3:53:28.400 --> 3:53:33.840]  fortunately that doesn't happen to most soldiers most soldiers have the kind of mindset understanding
[3:53:33.840 --> 3:53:40.560]  the reality of what's coming and yet the typical civilian working in america working in a warehouse
[3:53:40.560 --> 3:53:47.840]  or a desk job or or whatever they don't have that mindset now firefighters are survivors police
[3:53:47.840 --> 3:53:54.480]  officers that have been on the streets they've seen this too and their survivors and frankly
[3:53:54.480 --> 3:53:59.920]  even truck drivers because of the adversity that they deal with all the time they are survivors
[3:53:59.920 --> 3:54:05.280]  and they have to solve problems on the road and that they have to adapt to survive so there are
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:10.080]  people like truck drivers and firefighters and cops who are survivors out there but your average
[3:54:10.080 --> 3:54:17.040]  desk jockey worker in america does not have a survival mindset they have an appeasement mindset
[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:20.880]  and they're living in an artificial reality where they think everything's going to function
[3:54:20.880 --> 3:54:24.960]  and people are going to be polite and they make the mistake of thinking that others will abide
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:30.560]  by the rule of law and treat them the way that they want to be treated themselves your average cop
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:37.520]  has long ago abandoned such foolish faith in humanity your average beat cop knows what humans
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:42.480]  what humans are capable of and it's sickening i'm not even going to describe what the average
[3:54:42.480 --> 3:54:49.280]  street cop has seen out there with trafficking and children and rape and spouse abuse and all
[3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:55.280]  these things but you want to know about reality go talk to a cop who's worked in in a city like
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:55:00.400]  detroit or los angeles or houston for that matter they will give you the the real low
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:05.840]  down of what's coming if you don't adopt that mindset you won't make it so you need to change
[3:55:05.840 --> 3:55:11.680]  your mind very quickly i don't know go get some survival training go go take some rifle training
[3:55:11.680 --> 3:55:16.400]  go do something that challenges you to break out of your mental box and i know many of you do
[3:55:16.400 --> 3:55:22.160]  and i know most of you listening to this are already way above and beyond the average american in
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:26.320]  terms of your awareness your consciousness and your commitment to surviving all of this
[3:55:27.040 --> 3:55:32.000]  you're going to need the mindset you're going to need gear some gear you don't have to go overboard
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:36.240]  and you're going to need to be away from the chaos of the cities which will likely be plunged
[3:55:36.240 --> 3:55:42.480]  into darkness from there if you survive all that you're going to have to survive guerrilla warfare
[3:55:42.480 --> 3:55:47.280]  from the occupying un troops who will enter through the southern border they will enter
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:52.240]  through the port of los angeles governor newson has already done a deal with invading chinese
[3:55:52.240 --> 3:55:57.520]  troops according to my sources they're going to turn california into a beachhead of communist china
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:03.760]  those of you in eastern california and northern california you will be the front lines of a
[3:56:03.760 --> 3:56:09.840]  guerrilla war you'll have to start taking out communists by the way you better be able to shoot
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:16.080]  them straight because that it may very well come to that uh there will be un troops across america
[3:56:16.080 --> 3:56:21.040]  being activated in colorado and florida and other places according to my sources i don't care if you
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:26.560]  believe me or not i've been right about everything so far just as alex said at the opening of this
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:31.680]  show today we've been right we are the ones who nailed the accuracy of this our sources are correct
[3:56:31.680 --> 3:56:37.760]  and my sources are telling me again and again from multiple sources this is all about creating
[3:56:37.760 --> 3:56:43.840]  civil war conflicts so that the un occupation and invasion of america can be justified and called
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:50.480]  for by barack obama that's what this is coming to and yes you better have extra ammunition
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:55.760]  you better have night vision devices you better have your topo maps you better be able to navigate
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:57:01.200]  without gps you better get ready you're gonna have to fight for america's survival that's what
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:06.400]  this comes to that's the bottom line you want to live as a free person on the other side of this
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:12.400]  you're gonna have to get some things done in order to achieve that liberty is no longer free
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:17.680]  from this day forward you're going to have to earn it and you better have the right mindset
[3:57:17.680 --> 3:57:22.400]  you'd be willing to do what it takes to earn that freedom because you are being targeted your nation
[3:57:22.400 --> 3:57:28.320]  is under assault and there are treasonous criminals who belong behind bars running things in washington
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:33.520]  dc that's the truth and you're only going to get it here at info wars dot com stay tuned for oh
