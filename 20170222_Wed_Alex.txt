[00:19.000 --> 00:35.480]  Wow there is a major theme that has emerged in today's hundreds of articles I have here in
[00:35.480 --> 00:43.000]  front of me and video clips news pieces and it's one of bullying and it's one of misrepresentation
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.040]  and attempting to create an entire false reality of lies to then demonize the globalist opposition
[00:50.680 --> 00:58.040]  it's just crazy I have stacks of news here or even leftist are talking about the incredible bullying
[00:58.040 --> 01:07.320]  culture that has become cult like well it hasn't become cult like it's designed to be a cult
[01:07.320 --> 01:15.560]  and I think we finally have hit the Rubicon here ladies and gentlemen where we have something
[01:15.560 --> 01:22.680]  that is completely illustrative of what we're really dealing with an attempt to stifle free and
[01:22.680 --> 01:34.920]  open thought an attempt to bring in a new dark age university bands dorm room whiteboards to stop
[01:34.920 --> 01:42.120]  hurtful words yes this is out of the Detroit news in a statement the Detroit news

[02:34.040 --> 02:43.400]  Zealand where they are now reinstating 1930s 1940s style lifestyle the children run around barefooted

[08:37.560 --> 08:45.000]  nationalist statements in europe they are banning mild criticism of islam they are ordering the police
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.360]  departments in france and in germany and in sweden and the netherlands this is in their own
[08:50.360 --> 09:00.120]  news uh to ban the reporting of any muslims or migrants raping or robbing there have been fires
[09:00.120 --> 09:06.760]  now all week long basically in cities of sweden and rioting and raping that has just spilled out
[09:06.760 --> 09:15.080]  in an orgy of deliciousness for the islamicist and their dodo bird pray germany has ongoing
[09:15.080 --> 09:23.640]  fires and riots and of course france is just besieged uh with multiple multiple uh infernos
[09:23.640 --> 09:30.200]  going off uh just just in the center of paris every night uh tourism is down what 50 percent
[09:30.200 --> 09:35.320]  in just the last couple years 80 percent in the last decade uh they've declared civil
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.920]  emergencies on frances highways for two years uh there are just giant hordes of people just randomly
[09:40.920 --> 09:48.280]  running around in the rural areas just dragging families out of their vehicles i watched a video
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.400]  that paul watson put out it's about 12 minutes long titled the truth about sweden and i had
[09:53.400 --> 09:59.640]  remembered hearing about these cases and he just showed quick clips off the news and i thought i
[09:59.640 --> 10:06.120]  remember those videos but i tend to not go watch them because it makes me too upset but i said this
[10:06.120 --> 10:11.320]  morning about six a.m and i got out of bed before my kids had woken up i said i'm gonna go pull those
[10:11.320 --> 10:20.920]  up and i'm gonna watch them and i pulled up the sanitized rapes in sweden and it is unbelievable
[10:20.920 --> 10:25.960]  i mean you're talking about at a anti-racism open border concert where they where the leftists come
[10:25.960 --> 10:33.800]  and invite the muslim men in from collapsed areas uh of the middle east and morocco you name it and
[10:34.760 --> 10:39.560]  you will see 10 15 men grab a woman hold her and then they go in and start raping her and you
[10:39.560 --> 10:46.760]  could see the women flailing like they've got um you know just a ton of bricks on them i mean you
[10:46.760 --> 10:53.240]  could see the pressure you can see the panic uh you can see that what's the term and you don't
[10:53.240 --> 11:00.440]  like closed spaces claustrophobia and it just made it makes me feel claustrophobic i'm not really
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.800]  claustrophobic but i don't like really closed spaces and uh too much and it's just it's just the
[11:05.800 --> 11:11.400]  imagining these men and we're not showing you the graphic stuff it's online i mean they rape her
[11:11.400 --> 11:16.760]  and you could tell it's hurtner and and you can just see shots of her face where she looks so
[11:16.760 --> 11:24.840]  panicked and she's again one of these Swedes going out there to to be liberal and invite everybody
[11:24.840 --> 11:30.120]  and they say yes ma'am we are ready and i mean it's big guys too i mean they got her held down
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.120]  they're right there you can hear the audio people are celebrating all the music plays and they are
[11:34.120 --> 11:39.640]  raping raping raping raping raping there's more graphic footage online we're showing
[11:39.640 --> 11:44.360]  family friendly here i don't like having to show this to tv viewers folks but i found stuff where
[11:44.360 --> 11:52.680]  they rape a woman for 12 hours and in sweden the police went after people that reported it and
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.640]  called them animals that they're talking about and dining wilders again he's in the lead to be the
[11:57.640 --> 12:05.320]  new leader of the netherlands the new prime minister and all he has said is that they're
[12:05.320 --> 12:10.120]  facing extinction of the dutch people and that they're bringing the worst drags of the middle east
[12:10.120 --> 12:17.240]  in and that many of these people you know behave like like monsters and animals and they've already
[12:17.240 --> 12:23.320]  indicted him once for that he said it again yesterday and they're talking about inditing him yet again
[12:24.840 --> 12:30.520]  so these women come to these events with flowers to to worship the islamists because
[12:30.520 --> 12:34.040]  they've been told in their white guilt this is what you're supposed to do and they get gang raped
[12:34.040 --> 12:40.440]  so again viewer discretion is not really advised they want to put out the idea that
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.520]  trump wants to hurt women and then and that the west wants to hurt women there's this rape culture
[12:44.520 --> 12:50.040]  in the west which there isn't rape cultures in the middle east and africa folks let's just say
[12:50.040 --> 12:56.280]  where it is where women in most countries in africa are lower than dogs same thing in the
[12:56.280 --> 13:01.960]  middle east and and then i have to see feminists in germany and sweden out chanting a la akbar
[13:01.960 --> 13:05.880]  saying open up the borders leftists in germany want to give refugees the vote
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.360]  economists suggest move would trigger internal civil war
[13:14.520 --> 13:21.240]  but see we're not supposed to show you just the woman's face as she flails and begs and as they
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.760]  raped her and raped her and raped her and the police never came
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.600]  in germany if you even talk about it they suspend your facebook account
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.600]  and we're not supposed to show you how they openly have a hatred of the west
[13:37.560 --> 13:42.040]  that's the globalists that are manipulating this and they are directing all of this into our
[13:42.040 --> 13:46.840]  countries and into our world leak report six million migrants want to enter europe on top
[13:46.840 --> 13:51.160]  of what's already in turbo immigration time bomb on verge of exploding
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.960]  train terror in sweden chemical attack on train chokes passengers
[13:59.160 --> 14:00.200]  but all that's okay
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.560]  because we have to be taught to be open to every culture including if it has criminal
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.200]  actions involved like genital mutilation of women killing women if they talk back
[14:12.200 --> 14:16.040]  not letting women drive cars that's all something we should bring in right away
[14:16.040 --> 14:22.200]  but donald trump comes out you said you saw what happened last night in sweden
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.400]  and that's because it had been on info wars and that is news he got from there and had been on
[14:29.400 --> 14:35.720]  right bart that there had been more rapes in sweden more mass rapes and more attacks
[14:36.280 --> 14:40.280]  and then the night after he said it they and they make a joke out of it there's huge attacks
[14:40.280 --> 14:44.680]  and then the next night the next night but the media just has co-bearing everybody make jokes
[14:44.680 --> 14:49.000]  and says what happened last night in sweden we didn't know about this this is playing on
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.400]  their audience as if you're total idiots let me show you a drudgereport.com right now
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.880]  right in the middle of the column it says homeland does alex jones
[15:01.880 --> 15:05.560]  now we were contacted by people inside homeland two months ago and they said it's horrible the
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.000]  whole new series is based on you you commit horrible crimes you blame other people uh
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.960]  you know you're an islamophobe it's never the muslims doing it uh this brain damage cia guy
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.760]  thinks you're awesome but but you know his former partner knows he's mentally ill and of course
[15:20.760 --> 15:24.200]  there's a female president they wrote all this when they thought hillary was going to win
[15:26.600 --> 15:29.960]  they wrote all this when she was supposed to be the president and i'm this horrible guy
[15:29.960 --> 15:35.160]  who's against her and and the actor goes in between an australian a british and my accent
[15:35.160 --> 15:42.440]  accent a texas accent a blown out texas accent that's what i got here and then they had a bunch
[15:42.440 --> 15:51.560]  of articles coming out saying jones is crazy he thinks he's important he thinks they have tv
[15:51.560 --> 15:59.720]  shows about him he's schizophrenic or he's narcissistic i mean it's clearly me it looks
[15:59.720 --> 16:06.600]  like my old studio if they even his name's o' keith so they want some subliminal demonization
[16:06.600 --> 16:12.840]  of james o' keith as well when they ran trailers for this three weeks ago i got called saying
[16:12.840 --> 16:20.760]  why are you on homeland why are you sold out i've never watched homeland i mean christ carter came
[16:20.760 --> 16:26.040]  out you know a year ago and said the new x files doesn't just have a character based on alex and
[16:26.040 --> 16:33.240]  it's things almost exact studio we have here but this is high budget but i i think alex jones is a
[16:33.240 --> 16:37.240]  good guy and a libertarian and means well and is not racist and a lot of the themes we cover
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.480]  like forced inoculation and things like that come from alex jones and i think he's good
[16:41.480 --> 16:45.720]  and so the character i couldn't believe it was pretty positive now chris carter has got a lot
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.600]  of power and he's wealthy and he's successful so he's able to get what he wants on air a little bit
[16:50.600 --> 16:56.760]  the media tried to claim i made that up and that the x file wasn't about me
[16:59.160 --> 17:05.000]  now again i don't need validation by the x file new season and the next season coming out that was
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.120]  a pilot season being based let's say 60 around alex jones and that's what chris carter said
[17:11.480 --> 17:15.160]  we already have a giant audience we're having already having a giant effect it means nothing
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.280]  to have raw story write some article imply we're making this up because they have a tiny
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.400]  audience we're only covering it so you can see the deception of msm and how they lie and how they
[17:25.400 --> 17:36.040]  manipulate when clearly if you watch it and listen to it there i mean he says you want to fight you
[17:36.040 --> 17:45.160]  better believe you got one i'm coming after you it's my one of my taglines that i organically said
[17:45.160 --> 17:49.800]  like 10 years ago that i you know people like so i say it all the time now but this stuff didn't come
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.200]  out of some hollywood writer's office this came out of my guts out of my soul out of my heart
[17:54.200 --> 17:59.000]  and then enters the big story i'm skipping this break we'll be live today for a 13 hours until
[17:59.000 --> 18:08.760]  midnight central ad role is a big private company that works with google that's the company they make
[18:08.760 --> 18:13.560]  you pair with to have placed ads so that when your audience comes to your site when you go to other
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.920]  sites you see the ads and it was very successful for us and was pretty much our extra profit last
[18:18.920 --> 18:26.920]  year to help fund expansion this year and one of our writers miswrote ad blade ad blade places ads
[18:26.920 --> 18:32.040]  on your site this places your ads on other sites ad blade we've used them many years ad blades done
[18:32.040 --> 18:37.880]  a great job for us we actually use ad blade off and on and for some of the ads you see on the site
[18:37.880 --> 18:46.280]  when we take third party advertising so it was not ad blade it's ad role so i apologize that for
[18:46.280 --> 18:50.680]  like two minutes we put the wrong link up the reason they're having issues is their name is so close
[18:50.680 --> 18:58.920]  ad blade ad role it's ad role that tells us well you've been judged to be fake news we won't say by
[18:58.920 --> 19:05.160]  who you know letter and you're you're involved in politics and that's not allowed you know our ads
[19:05.160 --> 19:09.720]  weren't political but i mean they're gonna ban political ads they accept political ads but our
[19:09.720 --> 19:15.960]  ads weren't political the water filters non-gmo seeds nutraceuticals stuff like that they said
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.600]  you're almost three year relationship with us that brought in close to six million dollars
[19:21.480 --> 19:28.360]  three point three million last year it was set to go even bigger this year one of the big chunks
[19:28.360 --> 19:33.960]  of of where we're able to pay our bills around here and not profit of the company money we brought
[19:33.960 --> 19:40.840]  into fun things that's just gone boom they told us all political content should focus on the merits
[19:40.840 --> 19:45.400]  of the candidate political messages should not target specific interest groups now what's happening
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.960]  is they're being threatened by the rogues and the government that never left the trump can't kick
[19:49.960 --> 19:53.800]  out there's a total mutiny that have been saying they said this year they were going to ban our
[19:53.800 --> 19:57.960]  speech hillary did she said we're going to use the federal elections commission on alex jones
[19:57.960 --> 20:01.960]  and everybody else and her surrogates said that and they said we're going to go out and claim matt
[20:01.960 --> 20:06.840]  drudge and alex jones and right bark are all political because they have a political view
[20:06.840 --> 20:11.880]  that's pro america lower taxes and that that's under federal regulations as political speech
[20:11.880 --> 20:16.440]  and we're going to have the the board of governors of the federal elections commission go after them
[20:16.440 --> 20:21.080]  matt drudge was told that a year and a half ago by a major supreme court justice on record i saw
[20:21.080 --> 20:27.400]  hillary announced it six months ago and we covered it and you've seen the new york times
[20:28.840 --> 20:35.400]  six times i know of two of the pieces featured articles on me admitting we reach billions of
[20:35.400 --> 20:39.400]  people every year and that we're super dominant and that basically were fake news that need to
[20:39.400 --> 20:44.840]  be shut down and then we start getting shut down the day after the new york times comes out
[20:44.840 --> 20:48.440]  when the presidential candidate announced that she wants to go after us and the new york times
[20:48.440 --> 20:54.440]  says we got to shut down fake news the same author and all of it they have raw story come out and say
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.800]  oh alex thinks there's a tv show attacking him isn't he funny no one listens to that silly little
[21:01.800 --> 21:07.240]  crazy man that's meant to make me think i'm not successful you think that but that doesn't work
[21:07.240 --> 21:14.200]  on me but they think it works on you they want to marginalize me and shut me up and cut off our
[21:14.200 --> 21:18.920]  funding so they could shut you up and everybody else next just look at trying to shut up trump's
[21:18.920 --> 21:25.560]  family threatening him attacking baron saying kill his wife kill his daughters kill his sons lying
[21:25.560 --> 21:31.640]  about them uh shutting off her clothing line trying to bankrupt his properties his businesses
[21:31.640 --> 21:36.920]  going after his employees firing teachers that say they support him firing professors that support
[21:36.920 --> 21:45.560]  him they're a bunch of disgusting bullies and again they think they control reality oh alex
[21:45.560 --> 21:51.320]  thinks people are talking about him alex thinks he's successful well we at raw story in a bunch
[21:51.320 --> 22:00.920]  of other publications we say you're crazy and you think well thinking people will see right
[22:00.920 --> 22:04.600]  through this well they're not talking to thinking people if you look at raw stories demographics
[22:04.600 --> 22:11.480]  it's college students and old liberals and look at this university bans dorm room whiteboards to stop
[22:11.480 --> 22:18.440]  hurtful words this is again bookboarding this is book burning 2.0 they said well people would
[22:18.440 --> 22:23.160]  write things in the class hurtful show any form of public display come out they're banning chalk
[22:23.160 --> 22:28.040]  writing on the street or that is now banned because you might have a free thought and it might hurt
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.920]  someone everyone must be on a computer and controlled and tracked and nothing can be seen in a big
[22:32.920 --> 22:38.760]  group because it might upset someone this is beyond any cult i've ever heard of this is like
[22:38.760 --> 22:44.360]  skin arian you know studies where you know he raised kids inside boxes till they were 10 years
[22:44.360 --> 22:49.320]  old and turned them into disconnected mental patients but it was just psychological testing
[22:49.320 --> 22:54.680]  so it was okay to wire electrodes into their bloody mouths while he did it he's like a torture
[22:54.680 --> 23:02.760]  kids in boxes but it's okay because we're taking the the whiteboards away and the blackboards because
[23:02.760 --> 23:07.160]  those might have a racial combination and brown bags are illegal who can't have those and you know
[23:07.160 --> 23:13.240]  in seattle of the government building because there's just it's everywhere but islam let's bring
[23:13.240 --> 23:16.920]  in the most radical form of it and have it mutilate the women and rape everybody
[23:19.320 --> 23:23.880]  because it's liberal because islam doesn't have a rape culture america does
[23:23.880 --> 23:34.040]  us now continuing here university bans dorm room whiteboards to stop hurtful words
[23:35.080 --> 23:39.960]  and that's being reported by the detroit news with a straight face oh yes we can't allow open
[23:39.960 --> 23:43.800]  expression it might hurt someone's feelings see first they can't allow dodgeball then they can't
[23:43.800 --> 23:48.360]  allow tag then they can't allow getting trophies then they can't allow jogging then they have to
[23:48.360 --> 23:51.640]  get rid of the sports then they have to get rid of the term mommy and daddy they have to get rid
[23:51.640 --> 23:58.840]  of the genders because we're being destroyed as a species and you've got corporate collaborators
[23:58.840 --> 24:03.880]  that'll go along with this i want to air some of these homeland clips let's air the the newest one
[24:04.760 --> 24:07.880]  and then let's air the earlier one from the trailer where they don't even show the great
[24:07.880 --> 24:14.760]  evil alex shone's but while they do it they show the name okif on the desk so this is
[24:14.760 --> 24:18.760]  perfect composite just like you know they've got a couple movies out in the last few years
[24:18.760 --> 24:24.760]  where child molesters and murderers are named alex shone's it's a direct subliminal but here
[24:24.760 --> 24:30.200]  it's oak it's okif one of the other stalwart journalists fighting for liberty who's got big
[24:30.200 --> 24:35.560]  inside scoops inside cnn about to come out or a major news agency with just months inside their
[24:35.560 --> 24:41.720]  newsrooms as they lie as they manipulate as they frame as they scheme see that's why they want to
[24:41.720 --> 24:46.360]  shut off the internet because they can't defeat us i mean okif has some videos with 60 million views
[24:46.360 --> 24:50.200]  the average one has like five million that's bigger than cnn every day what are they gonna do
[24:50.200 --> 24:55.480]  they want us banned because they say you don't have a right to hear from us but before they ban us
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.600]  before they cut off our advertising takes tens of millions of dollars to run this operation
[25:00.600 --> 25:06.440]  every year we figure out how to use a platform with google to bring in 3.3 million dollars that's
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.040]  gross then you know let's say a couple million in profit to fund the company and then they just
[25:12.040 --> 25:17.640]  take that away all the extra money we had budgeted this year and we have that money for expansion
[25:17.640 --> 25:21.560]  this year but then we have nothing for next year so then we can't expand this year see how that
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.040]  works and we know they're going to shut more of what we do now if this is successful so i've
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.440]  got to go get lawyers i guess i guess i've got to look into lawsuits because it's discriminatory
[25:30.440 --> 25:37.320]  if you can sue people and win and have the police write you tickets because you won't make a gay couple
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.520]  a cake then if you go to a company that you've been with for years and they say sorry we say
[25:42.520 --> 25:47.880]  you're fake news somebody told us you're banned now because of your thoughts and your beliefs
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.360]  that's totally discriminatory and if they organize it with other groups and that fake
[25:52.360 --> 25:58.280]  washington post list they had to retract now it's racketeering getting together and organizing
[25:58.280 --> 26:04.040]  to not let me have access to the market oh hey apple's a private company but can i go to the mall
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.600]  and they say sorry you're a white male you're not welcome in apple that that's pretty much where it's
[26:08.600 --> 26:14.360]  going and it's a little beta white no telling you that you know that's the whole parallel universe
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.280]  here and you say that's discriminatory you're going to win a lawsuit folks they're not giving
[26:20.280 --> 26:26.680]  you access to the market but i can't go to ad roll not ad blade and i'm sure people get
[26:26.680 --> 26:33.880]  them confused ad roll ad roll ad roll and i can be with them for almost three years and then they
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.040]  just decide because the media and the government and all these groups say it's time to ban alec shones
[26:38.040 --> 26:42.360]  it's time to ban milo it's time to block his book they've got an excuse for everybody
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.920]  everybody's dehumanized everybody you know has some reason to have their basic rights taken away
[26:49.160 --> 26:53.400]  federal elections commission we say drudges political shut him down don't let him have
[26:53.400 --> 26:59.080]  links to news stories well where's the first amendment they're doing it it's here it's happening
[26:59.080 --> 27:04.680]  so ad roll wants to do this and tell us this because somebody told them we were fake news
[27:06.120 --> 27:11.000]  then meanwhile i get to have the new york times the washington post and every other publication
[27:11.000 --> 27:20.360]  you could imagine every week now sometimes multiple times a day saying untruths twisted
[27:20.360 --> 27:28.040]  dis info you name it total lies you name it and then i have them trying to shut me off radio
[27:28.040 --> 27:34.600]  off cable off tv off the internet off of advertising platforms and we know we're under scrutiny so we
[27:34.600 --> 27:41.320]  have the most milk toast ads make no claims not with water filters not with supplements not with
[27:41.320 --> 27:45.800]  even though we can make claims with many of these because they're nutraceuticals many of these are
[27:45.800 --> 27:52.040]  being turned into drugs things like bio pqq we popularized iodine now it's in stores everywhere
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.400]  the crappy versions but but but they know what we're doing and they want to shut us up and now
[27:57.400 --> 28:04.280]  they have people who they try to have sound just like me and say the exact words i say out of context
[28:05.320 --> 28:11.160]  to then demonize us further and then they say no that's not you you're crazy because they
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.760]  believe they control reality because they're a cult of control freaks this is psychological warfare
[28:16.760 --> 28:23.480]  so let's play the clips from the new homeland if you stop pushing back against them here every
[28:23.480 --> 28:32.040]  minute if you are that stupid what do you get boom that's what you get
[28:32.040 --> 28:41.560]  madame president elect i hope you're listening and if you are hear me now you brought this down
[28:41.560 --> 28:51.560]  on us you did and i can't take it anymore i won't take it anymore and i am not alone i am not alone
[28:51.560 --> 29:01.320]  alone if you want a fight and apparently you do if you want a fight you've got one from me in spades
[29:03.080 --> 29:10.920]  you've got the fight of your life so almost completely directly plagiarized of things i've
[29:10.920 --> 29:17.000]  said and then they steal my identity my voice try to attack me and then say they didn't do it
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.600]  just like obama care is free and you can keep your doctor and then the gruber gets up on tv and
[29:22.600 --> 29:29.960]  goes thank god alex jones is such a dumb f or thank god you're a dumb f or thank god we all are
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.200]  right because that's what they're saying at a fruity and slipped up that's what it is they're
[29:34.200 --> 29:38.360]  saying i'm dumb you're dumb we're all dumb because obama care is free and then and then
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.400]  the gruber goes on tv and says thank god we're also stupid well we're not all that stupid you're
[29:43.400 --> 29:48.200]  just a bunch of con artists that think we're idiots and we're awake now and we know what you are scumbags
[29:49.160 --> 29:55.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.880 --> 30:03.800]  in a string of unfortunate drop dead instances of top russian diplomats
[30:03.800 --> 30:09.400]  vitali churkin russia's ambassador to the un has just been added to the list just in the last two
[30:09.400 --> 30:14.760]  months this marks the fourth case in an unprecedented series of leading russian diplomats being
[30:14.760 --> 30:19.960]  either shot on the spot or found dead all these men played instrumental roles in promotion of
[30:19.960 --> 30:25.320]  relations between russia and other countries as the fake stream media continues to cultivate
[30:25.320 --> 30:31.000]  public hatred toward russia and the deep states declared war on president trump condemning him
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.080]  as a russian agent and putin's puppet reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity one has to wonder
[30:37.080 --> 30:41.800]  are all these deaths merely a coincidence you decide but i'll leave you with a statement from the
[30:41.800 --> 30:46.280]  previous administration spokesman john kerby who threatened moscow with terror attacks in russian
[30:46.280 --> 30:51.480]  cities and even shootdowns of russian jets if latimer putin continued his fight against isis in
[30:51.480 --> 30:58.040]  syria uh there are other options uh that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy this bandaria

[33:03.640 --> 33:09.880]  you are one of the very few who are operating under this this under this theory to be an independent
[33:09.880 --> 33:15.880]  american in a as in a big way if you're calling is media fine if you're calling is sports whatever
[33:15.880 --> 33:22.840]  it is but you've got to be the greatest you can be now i don't know why they've been successful
[33:22.840 --> 33:28.840]  in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these facebook's and these tweets and uh these
[33:28.840 --> 33:35.560]  instagrams these instas this is ghetto this is ghetto this is corporate they're taking your
[33:35.560 --> 33:40.360]  they're taking your energy they're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return nothing
[33:40.360 --> 33:45.240]  they're dumbing the language down twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984
[33:45.240 --> 33:51.240]  it's insoc i had a supreme court justice tell me to my face it's over for me said mad it's over for
[33:51.240 --> 33:55.720]  you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law you're out of there they're gonna make it so
[33:55.720 --> 34:00.600]  headlines you can't even use headlines to have a supreme court justice say that to my face that
[34:00.600 --> 34:07.240]  it's over they've gotten the votes which means time is limited time is not forever how many more
[34:07.240 --> 34:13.640]  moons and sunrises will you see in your life uh rise and fall there's not that many it's a small
[34:13.640 --> 34:18.680]  amount so for people to be saying with this attitude oh i'll get on with my life and my
[34:18.680 --> 34:25.320]  greatness sometime no no you can't we're being enslaved now and that's it under the tpp they
[34:25.320 --> 34:31.400]  admit you can't put a headline to the new york times you're sending massive traffic to them
[34:31.400 --> 34:36.680]  they're claiming you're taking their words this is insane and you had the justice steven brier
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.560]  said we need to look at a global law now remember just recently getting lined up with it so they're
[34:41.560 --> 34:45.880]  getting ready for these decisions to come you thought obama care was shocking you thought
[34:45.880 --> 34:50.760]  some of these other decisions were shocking wait until these copyright laws work their way up
[34:50.760 --> 34:58.200]  and the supreme court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board
[35:00.840 --> 35:08.680]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[35:13.320 --> 35:19.640]  now i want to be clear okay this broadcast is not about outlets shows our job is not to be
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.760]  gonzo journalist here but to defend media institutions and outlets that have histories of
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.560]  telling the truth like james oakheaf and project veritas and matt drudge of drudge report dot com
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.640]  and world net daily and bright bart and daily caller and a few of the fox news host
[35:36.600 --> 35:41.160]  limbaugh is not perfect handy's not perfect but they're light years better than the globalist
[35:41.160 --> 35:46.120]  they're at least not out to get the country they're at least nationalist okay which again
[35:46.120 --> 35:53.720]  they're light years better we're all under attack okay and one thing as individual as we don't have
[35:53.720 --> 35:58.840]  is the ability that collectives do to get together on things they're a bunch of like one foot tall
[35:58.840 --> 36:04.840]  spiritually you know snot-nosed cowardly want to be bullies and we just kind of kick the gremlins
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.560]  off as we go about our daily business but when you start getting piled on by hundreds of them they
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.720]  can really do some damage and that's why when i saw rush limbaugh six years ago when they were
[36:15.720 --> 36:21.160]  about to cancel a show for a long time almost a year they'd driven down the revenue on the show
[36:21.160 --> 36:26.600]  driven down the price of the ads by 50 and i'm a good opportunist i mean if i could be opportunistic
[36:26.600 --> 36:33.720]  and actually help somebody that's a win-win i mean i love non-zero some games and so i went
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.680]  to spend a quarter million dollars on the rush limbaugh show and made some decent money back
[36:38.680 --> 36:47.160]  and put it back into the operation it wasn't huge advertising my films and i did it because i wanted
[36:47.800 --> 36:53.800]  to send a signal that i was classy but that i also had common sense and if they could bring down
[36:54.840 --> 37:00.280]  rush limbaugh they could then target and bully and bring down everybody it's 101 common sense
[37:00.280 --> 37:10.120]  hang together or hang separate as benjamin franklin said and there is no one under more attack
[37:10.120 --> 37:16.440]  other than donald trump it's official now for a year running there is no one under
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.560]  more attack than donald trump except for me all right donald trump is obviously under
[37:23.560 --> 37:29.080]  20 times the attack i'm under it's global it's huge but the only other person under more attack
[37:29.080 --> 37:35.480]  than myself is donald trump and that's a fact and i'm not up here on a high horse saying that
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.440]  it's very daunting quite frankly just to know there's that much scum and that many collaborators
[37:40.440 --> 37:46.920]  and that many evil people and mercenaries politically in this country that i am the second
[37:46.920 --> 37:53.560]  most attacked person in the world now i mean it's finally dawned on me when there are
[37:53.560 --> 38:02.600]  on an average day 50 major newspapers lying about me and calling for me to be shut down
[38:02.600 --> 38:06.360]  and saying i'm trying to cause a violent revolution and then i'm a criminal and i'm a terrorist
[38:07.960 --> 38:15.320]  some days they're over a thousand i don't even pay attention now reportedly it's abc cbs nbc
[38:16.360 --> 38:22.440]  even fox attacks me it's just everywhere and it's it's lies it's edited tapes it's things out of
[38:22.440 --> 38:28.360]  context you know what they're doing and why are they doing that they know the form of americana
[38:29.160 --> 38:37.480]  that i'm promoting is the truth and they know it is medicine to a dying body they know that it's
[38:37.480 --> 38:44.440]  the antithesis of the globalist new world order control system and they're scared of it they're
[38:44.440 --> 38:50.440]  scared of you and that again is not some patronizing oh make you feel like you're part of it they're
[38:50.440 --> 38:58.200]  you know they're really scared of you audience no you are 100 percent of the force of info wars
[38:58.200 --> 39:07.800]  we're only a focal point a rallying point a a a particle beam laser atomic powered aimed at the
[39:07.800 --> 39:15.160]  globalist all of our energies all of our prayers all of our focus all of our action as a symbol
[39:15.160 --> 39:21.800]  info wars is now a rallying cry just like the name trump is against the new world order and
[39:21.800 --> 39:28.120]  they know that and drudge is a rallying cry for a free and an open press and so you've got
[39:30.680 --> 39:37.880]  trump info wars and drudge drudge has been smart and has just been about the info
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.320]  knowing he's already been under a greater attack than i've been over time so over time drudge has
[39:43.320 --> 39:49.000]  been under a lot more attack so he had a strategy obviously of just making about the info being
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.680]  mysterious for his own protection and it's really worked and he's been through a lot obviously but
[39:54.680 --> 40:00.680]  he's he's on top i mean it's it's it's it's legendary so there's so so drudge came a long
[40:00.680 --> 40:09.320]  time ago i was a slow grower now just exploding just like you know hydrogen bombs inside the
[40:09.320 --> 40:16.680]  globalist system and then trump is just like boom on the scene the last two years just giant explosion
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.000]  and that's why they're trying to demonize and manipulate and take down all three but if you
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.120]  notice they're particularly wanting to get alex jones because if they can boycott us and get
[40:28.120 --> 40:33.320]  people to shut us down and go in with racketeering and manipulate threaten groups try to cut off our
[40:33.320 --> 40:40.200]  funding it will be used as a template as media matters and david brock admits to shut down all
[40:40.200 --> 40:46.120]  other free press in this country including the left that they have bullied and taken control of
[40:46.120 --> 40:49.960]  and turned into this monstrous thing it is today and the left had problems before but
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.520]  i wasn't sure it was worse mainline conservatives are left you know 10 years ago boy we see how
[40:54.520 --> 41:03.080]  the cancer grew we see in what tissue in what soil this monster came so that's why i'm telling
[41:03.080 --> 41:11.000]  everybody that when they have not just homeland but other tv shows demonizing yours truly and
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.440]  they create fictional characters that are strong in saying the things i say word for word
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.680]  but then having it in the episode where i get innocent muslims arrested and and i'm actually
[41:22.680 --> 41:27.000]  the person that gets people blown up that's what they say that the folks that watch the episode
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.080]  and you know what i'm going to reach out to our contact inside you know you're attacking me you've
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.640]  plagiarized me i never even got back with the people inside that wanted to give me all the
[41:35.640 --> 41:40.040]  scripts and stuff like i got the machete script and then rodriguez said it wasn't real and it was
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.520]  word for word the script i'm going to get the future scripts i'm going to get all of them
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.320]  try to send a cease and assist you're attacking me you're plagiarizing my words to then create
[41:49.320 --> 41:55.720]  situational ethics where i'm always a villain and cause calamities to promote this idea that
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.440]  i should be shut down in the real world you are the ultimate fake news not only has cnn been caught
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.840]  giving hillary the questions and fixing things and manipulating and colluding and lying and the
[42:06.840 --> 42:18.040]  other big networks you now in the globalist combine from hbo to show time to you name it
[42:18.040 --> 42:23.880]  create these strongmen reports about yours truly or create whole actors out of whole cloth to then
[42:23.880 --> 42:31.400]  do bad things that you then want to be have projected on to us and accepted by the public
[42:31.400 --> 42:36.440]  i mean it's just it's incredible and then you claim i'm the fake news my name is alexander
[42:36.440 --> 42:42.760]  emrick jones i was born in dallas texas in 1974 my mama and my daddy or who i say they were
[42:42.760 --> 42:46.600]  everything i've ever done has been in front of god country and the rest of the world with my butt
[42:46.600 --> 42:55.080]  hanging out i'm just naked in front of the whole world everybody knows it i'm genuine i'm real but
[42:55.080 --> 43:00.360]  i act like a jerk and blow up it's real that wasn't an act yesterday i mean i just at a certain
[43:00.360 --> 43:07.880]  point i get into fighting mode at a certain point all the niceties go away and the fact that
[43:08.840 --> 43:15.560]  that that our country has fallen so far that they would call for us to be banned and shut down and
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.600]  to have our finance sources cut off in the most discriminatory dangerous way you could imagine
[43:20.600 --> 43:26.680]  and then it would just be done and i knew yesterday when i covered this and talked about this with
[43:26.680 --> 43:34.200]  ad roll not ad blade that's a good advertising company that ad roll that there wouldn't be anything
[43:34.200 --> 43:39.080]  in the newspaper today and you know why anything big like this that isn't a strategy given to the
[43:39.080 --> 43:44.120]  operatives then they run with that strategy for a day a week a month then they get a new strategy
[43:44.120 --> 43:49.480]  and then that comes out they're having to go back and say hey we we had a big score we had a big hit
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.600]  but this will look really bad if we admit we're going in and getting ad agencies
[43:54.600 --> 43:58.840]  to not let people advertise with them anymore there's a lot of lawsuits the washington post two
[43:58.840 --> 44:04.040]  months ago had to pull their list of fake news because of lawsuits what are we going to do we
[44:04.040 --> 44:11.000]  just hit a big score behind the scenes but jones is going to sue in discovery and find out what
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.560]  we did well then don't report on it because we don't want to be connected to it see because
[44:15.560 --> 44:19.480]  that's the racketeering it's when they're all organized behind the scenes not letting you in
[44:19.480 --> 44:27.240]  the mall in the apple store in the uh cafe because you're black or to the front of the bus because
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.520]  you're black same thing oh you're a conservative we put you on a list beyond nazi germany with the
[44:32.520 --> 44:36.360]  yellow stars that's what they first told the jews and others you can't have businesses in this area
[44:36.360 --> 44:40.920]  town then you can't have businesses period this is how they shut you down and put you in your
[44:40.920 --> 44:46.360]  electronic ghettos and what did matt drudge say here 16 months ago in the air in his one interview
[44:46.360 --> 44:52.520]  in the last four years he said they're putting us into electronic ghettos where they can fully
[44:52.520 --> 44:56.840]  control us and then shut us down when they want we've got to build our own platforms and fight
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.720]  with those that's true net neutrality isn't even so much how the data goes over the telecoms that's
[45:01.720 --> 45:07.320]  part of it but that these big systems have gobbled it all up and gotten control of the whole thing
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.840]  and then they themselves filter it and manipulate it through false advertising so what i'm talking
[45:12.840 --> 45:19.880]  about here isn't just info wars it's that we represent you you represent us if they can take
[45:19.880 --> 45:25.960]  donald trump down if they can take matt drudge down if they can take alex jones down they can
[45:25.960 --> 45:31.480]  take everybody down and trump is trying to cut your taxes trying to cut the regulations trying
[45:31.480 --> 45:36.280]  to get big mega banks under his orders they were giving all that free money taxpayer money to loan
[45:36.280 --> 45:41.160]  it back to small businesses that generate 80 percent of the jobs and the federal reserve is
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.160]  challenging him right now there's a big fight they were already supposed to be gone he's supposed
[45:45.160 --> 45:51.160]  to have us do people they're even trying to block that there are epic battles going on right now
[45:51.160 --> 45:58.040]  and small business numbers the last two months are the highest since 1984 despite the big banks
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.680]  doing everything they can to try to suppress things and trump hasn't gotten one tenth of his
[46:02.680 --> 46:08.040]  financial agenda through which is meant to break the collectivist and this plan to make us all poor
[46:08.040 --> 46:14.920]  and have monopolies they control and internet they control where zuckerberg and smith and all of them
[46:14.920 --> 46:21.640]  were caught in the wiki leaks with hillary with the white house with soros daily changing what you
[46:21.640 --> 46:29.880]  could see in the search results about hillary good things about hillary bad things about trump
[46:30.200 --> 46:37.320]  and we've had the best numbers since 1984 and it goes on and on and on and so we're in a race
[46:37.320 --> 46:40.520]  and so here it is i don't want to sit up here everybody wants to call and thank me do not
[46:40.520 --> 46:47.400]  thank me but love it or hate it info wars you're truly in this in this war in this day and age in
[46:47.400 --> 46:55.400]  this historical time there's only a few big dogs in the arena okay and all of those people are under
[46:55.400 --> 47:05.160]  systemic constant mega attack so know this people want me to sue takes money people want me to keep
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.560]  expanding or stay the size we are under all this attack so we can't just say the same size we're
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.520]  always under attack i know we got to get even bigger to be able to defeat them in the future
[47:14.520 --> 47:19.240]  and i could see this into the future i understand this i said this 10 years ago i said the media
[47:19.240 --> 47:22.920]  always attacks me and says i do this for money they always attack and try to destroy my family
[47:22.920 --> 47:26.760]  i said that's it i'm gonna explode in size and not just reach five million people a week i'm
[47:26.760 --> 47:31.080]  gonna reach 20 million we did it as of about four years ago then i said i'm gonna go to the next
[47:31.080 --> 47:35.080]  level i made that announcement on here i said we're gonna go to 50 million a week we now basically
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.720]  have reached that remember two years ago i played that promo for a year we now take the info war to
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.320]  the next level why do you think they're coming after us folks next level is their total annihilation
[47:46.040 --> 47:51.320]  next level is their cultural destruction they're trying to ban white boards folks and free speech
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.480]  modern book burning because you can't be allowed in front of a group to share a thought
[47:55.480 --> 48:01.880]  we're being inducted into a giant brainwashing cult humanity struggling back and info wars is
[48:02.440 --> 48:07.400]  the epicenter you are the epicenter that has already sent shock waves through and was the key
[48:07.400 --> 48:13.960]  demographic to push trump over the verge and over the edge but now the enemy's not as arrogant as
[48:13.960 --> 48:19.960]  they were they had measured the drapes they had tv shows already produced and already set up were
[48:19.960 --> 48:26.920]  hillary's the president and i'm attacking her those are seven eight month old scripts now
[48:26.920 --> 48:34.040]  that it got produced months ago only just now came out on homeland there's another book that
[48:34.040 --> 48:37.800]  chelsea had published that was meant for her mom to be president chelsea would run the bill
[48:37.800 --> 48:44.040]  and melinda gates foundation worldwide and set up global government that's all blown up now so
[48:44.040 --> 48:49.080]  here's the great successes we've had and now these rats that stole the money from you know
[48:49.080 --> 48:54.360]  hating everything else they think they own you and your family and they think we're beaten and
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.160]  they think they're just gonna sit there and start shutting off the internet in classic racketeering
[48:59.160 --> 49:04.760]  and taking whole classes and groups of people and dehumanizing them and saying you don't exist
[49:04.760 --> 49:09.880]  you don't have access to twitter or facebook or google you don't have access to the
[49:10.440 --> 49:15.480]  international ad networks you don't have access and rights to your own domain names
[49:15.480 --> 49:24.360]  because we said outside of a court pulled it out of our gross globalist rears we say you are fake
[49:24.360 --> 49:31.720]  no we're game changing we're world changing we are the david versus the goliath we are the people
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.280]  we are the sleeping giant that will bring down your filthy giant and you know it
[49:37.720 --> 49:43.960]  so we're going for 13 hours today again sounds like a lot of money losing you know we've made
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.400]  3.3 million last year in that program to fund our operation not profit money to fund the operation
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.680]  out of the advertising money we spend very successful ad program i can tell you

[51:28.440 --> 51:34.120]  folks you have to understand when you really are reaching on your own streams 10 million people a
[51:34.120 --> 51:39.720]  week at info wars.com video and more than 15 million a week is millions a day download the podcast
[51:39.720 --> 51:44.120]  and you're paying for that bandwidth even though it's the cheapest out there and you're i mean
[51:44.120 --> 51:48.520]  we have to have our own platform like drudge said we have to have our own systems we have to have
[51:49.160 --> 51:53.480]  our own program because they'll be able to just to kick us off these third party
[51:53.480 --> 51:58.760]  behemoths but we use the big third party behemoths to reach the public knowing they were moving
[51:58.760 --> 52:03.080]  towards shutting it down but fighting on those behemoths to try to keep them honest and not
[52:03.080 --> 52:07.960]  let them go in that direction but the democratic party the globalists the big banks goldman sacks
[52:07.960 --> 52:16.680]  all of them openly on november 9th said you will kick alex jones and you will kick breitbart
[52:16.680 --> 52:21.560]  and you will kick them all off the problem is they can't kick drudge off because he's got his own
[52:21.560 --> 52:27.880]  web page he's not on you know facebook and all these places he's got outposts on twitter but
[52:27.880 --> 52:32.680]  but he's the kind the last kind of guy to stand because he has his own system but they kick breitbart
[52:32.680 --> 52:38.920]  off they took their advertising away they kicked them off uh uh their their their free apps they've
[52:38.920 --> 52:43.720]  had for years that people contacted them through and and they're so busy with ban and fighting to
[52:43.720 --> 52:47.880]  get the agenda through to cut your taxes and defeat the globalists that i'm told and i don't like
[52:47.880 --> 52:51.720]  hearing this that breitbart's losing a lot of money and in trouble and it's because they they're
[52:51.720 --> 52:55.560]  under attack ladies and gentlemen and they sick they're all conservative and stalwart while they're
[52:55.560 --> 53:00.280]  being burned to the ground just bill where's gonna stay at the ship keep i keep attacking get them
[53:00.280 --> 53:05.880]  their tax cuts well cannonballs are coming in i'm not going to sit there and do that we're in a war
[53:05.880 --> 53:11.960]  you understand that a total war if i told you the other things i know the things that are going on
[53:11.960 --> 53:19.080]  it but i can't if i told you it's it's it's a james bond movie but it's worse than that okay
[53:19.080 --> 53:23.400]  if these big companies have suicide net factories and that's what they think what do you think about
[53:23.400 --> 53:27.560]  you what they'd like to do to you as an american these are the most selfish scumbag people you

[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:20.920]  anymore on the internet through our platforms and just say you're fake you're subhuman that's like
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:24.920]  saying i guess that's the way to like ban gays from stuff to say gays are now fake news they're

[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:34.760]  it's fake news so that's okay i say you're fake that's libel that's slander that's defamation
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:40.120]  they're the ones organizing behind the scenes to do it the new york times and everybody cheerleading
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:46.680]  shut alex jones up his fake news is going to get people killed then they put out fake news
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:52.840]  about what we've said that generates hysteria because my name has so much credibility with people
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:59.320]  then somebody goes in there with a gun and now it's my fault they know exactly what they're doing
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.760]  dirt bags
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:07.400]  we've got a lot of special reports to get to as well paul joseph watson
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:13.960]  did an incredibly powerful one the truth about sweden and
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:24.200]  it just makes your mind real to realize that things have gotten this crazy and this out of control
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:31.000]  so but this is a very very positive sign as long as we fight back as long as we adapt and overcome
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:37.240]  as long as we resist this politically and peacefully what we're promoting is classic americana renaissance
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:41.880]  classical liberalism they've just changed all the definitions the old fake conservatives
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:45.720]  that want to control people by guilt nobody's listening to them the leftist that want to
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:50.280]  control everybody by guilt and they're called people don't want that all the demographics and
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:56.040]  numbers show it no matter what color you are they're trying to bully everybody right now out of
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:03:00.840]  panicked understanding that humanity the sleeping giant as i said earlier is awakening
[1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:08.360]  i've got so many of these special reports i want to get to but let's play brazilian ski's daughter
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:16.840]  on msnbc our job is to control exactly what people think that's their job see i'm here to get you to
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:21.160]  think for yourself see what the globalists are thinking so you understand the real paradigm not
[1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:26.040]  the little false paradigms they try to get us caught up in where universities are now banning
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.600]  whiteboards because somebody might write something that's offensive so see ban books because somebody
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:35.960]  might write something that's offensive you're like oh it's not that bad that's the plan so let's go to
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:42.760]  mika here it is exactly that is that's exactly what i hear what you just said is what i hear
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:48.600]  from all the trump supporters that i talked to who were trump voters and are still trump supporters
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:54.360]  they go yeah you guys are going crazy he's doing what are you so surprised about he's doing exactly
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:04:01.720]  what he said he's going to do well and i think that the dangerous you know edges here are that he's
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:08.360]  trying to undermine the media trying to make up his own facts and it could be that while unemployment
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:14.280]  and uh the the economy worsens he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:20.920]  actually control right exactly what people think and that is the that is your job yeah if you look
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:27.880]  at the issues i love how mainstream media tries to act like they're not trying to influence you
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:32.920]  that's their biggest bias is that i'm here openly trying to influence an open free society second
[1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:40.280]  amendment pro-life but also a very tolerant society and religious freedom and nationalism
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:45.400]  and studying how combines and globalism monopolies have taken over in the past and have taken over
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:51.160]  now to reverse that i'm a fan of humanity see i just wore it all in my sleep these people are
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:57.800]  all sick of fans in new york and la in places like trump talked about the elites trying to become
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:06.120]  more elite the new season of homeland is now available on showtime and it features an obnoxious
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:13.400]  internet radio talk show host that is obviously supposed to represent alex jones and info wars
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:19.960]  in the latest episode the alex jones character is seen ranting and raving about a terrorist attack
[1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:27.400]  in new york a bomb going off in the streets of new york city again the more i think about that
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:35.880]  the angrier i get i mean i am sitting here i am so upset i can barely speak boom this alex
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:42.040]  jones parody takes homeland in a new direction this season as earlier plots usually focused
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:48.760]  around islamic terrorism but now the narrative has changed and it appeases liberals by allowing
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:55.880]  political correctness and social justice narratives to totally ruin what was once an enjoyable show

[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.640]  of the globalist program and the con men that thought that they could just keep all this

[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:49.880]  banning fake news tell us how to do it with a straight face might as well say you've got great
[1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:54.840]  suicide vans and fall on gong prisoners you harvest their organs gee tell us how you did that too
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:01.320]  we've now reached this otherworldly craziness where they're still going ahead with their internet
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:05.640]  takeover plan and they're planning to block nationalist movements in europe at the state
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:10.840]  department even though trumps in and they're just ignoring whatever the president says
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:19.720]  and you've got reports up on drudge report where maxine waters is calling trumps cabinet scumbags
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:26.120]  that's when she's not saying that putin and the russians have invaded korea not north or south
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:31.880]  just korea of course they didn't invade either but there's been no military action by the russians
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:37.240]  which just doesn't matter just because you know all her opposition is subhuman see we're all
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:43.400]  scumbags we're all fake news Pelosi still thinks bush is the president george w but that's okay
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:50.040]  that's okay that can we queue up the scumbag part we can now i'm gonna take your phone calls at the
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:55.800]  bottom of the hour but i wanted to get the selling in because he's an expert on it he's uh written a
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:12:05.560]  book about it scott greer he's at thedailycaller.com i wanted to get him on because he's written
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:12.520]  articles dealing with all this students wear white pens to remind them of white privilege
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:19.480]  but but it gets better here's another one uh today this is out of the the detroit news university
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:32.280]  bands dorm room that's right university bands door room white boards to stop hurtful words
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:41.240]  the college fix and he's written the book no campus for white men and and folks whenever arkansas
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:48.200]  wouldn't let little black girls into the public school eisenhower in 1959 sent in the national
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:55.000]  guard also happened what in alabama this though is literally as we've all seen the footage of
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.240]  where people come over to a white person say you're not welcome on campus and now the black
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:03.800]  groups the hispanic groups others are saying we want our own white free area and then now it's
[1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:07.400]  just no whites at all and then if you go to the campuses you've got to go attend classes where
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:11.320]  you're taught in stock home syndrome that you're you're inherently bad because you're white they're
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:17.720]  dividing the the the schools up the secondary learning the colleges of higher learning into
[1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:22.360]  prisons that's how you control prisons and anywhere in the country you got hispanics blacks
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:26.280]  and whites there's a big asian population say france san francisco you got an area for the
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:31.560]  you got an area for the asians that's how the warden the divide and conquer folks control so
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:36.760]  they're invoking the most hardcore racism and also saying ban free speech can't have white boards
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:40.200]  because that might hurt somebody's feelings of somebody might write something bad that's saying
[1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:48.040]  banned books somebody might write something bad this is a total admitted cult and jerry seinfeld
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:54.360]  can come out and basically um admit that jerry seinfeld can say that you know liberalism and
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:58.760]  political crisis is a cult but he still supports all the other major tenants of it so there's also
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:03.560]  this insanity inside the left of going along this and now they're outright bullies just beating up
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.800]  white people everywhere mainly white people doing it and saying you have no right and of course we
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:13.320]  have the d well one of the dmc candidates high level democrats saying i'm white but i will suppress
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:17.400]  the whites and make sure they don't get privilege and you get all the privilege and then you have
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:23.000]  ad role that works with google one of the biggest ad agencies out there saying info wars isn't allowed
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:29.480]  to advertise with us ever almost three years on our online platforms because we say you're hateful

[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:20.120]  you know you hear this stuff and it sounds crazy till you see the videos of it or i read a book
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:24.840]  and like you've written i want to get into that and where you think all this is going but before
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:29.560]  we do that what do you make of all the announcements that we should be banned you should be banned and
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:35.240]  now the attempts to do it what do we do about this because i mean you know if a cake place gets sued
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:40.120]  and the and the police indict them for not making a cake for gay people you know i say hey bake their
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:44.360]  cake but but here's the deal then i'm not allowed other companies though can refuse a new business
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:49.640]  with me saying i'm a subhuman i'm a bad person because i'm a conservative or i'm white i mean
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:54.760]  what's going on here well they try to do that with everything the left now is particularly
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:59.960]  anti-free speech anti-free speech is a cornerstone of their ideology they mark everything as hate
[1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:04.520]  speech info wars is hate speech bribe arts hate speech daily callers hate speech donald trump's
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:08.760]  hate speech miley anopoulos is hate speech everything is hate speech and they try to shut
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:13.960]  everything down when the place we see this the most is on a college campus that's why i wrote
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:18.440]  no canvas for white man because this is a problem that everybody's seeing but it's now going outside
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:22.440]  of the college campus where they're trying to shut down ad revenue there's just a story this week
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:26.760]  uh coming from buzzfeed where they got a leaked email from a major corporation saying that a lot
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.840]  of their clients are wanting to blacklist bribe art because they don't want to be associated with
[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:35.880]  the hateful rhetoric there and almost the way that you have to push back is there has to be pressure
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:40.360]  from conservatives from the right to say that you know we're going to support this company and we're
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:45.560]  going to boycott you if you are punishing conservatives just for expressing their free speech
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:49.400]  you know the left the reason why they always cater to the left is the left has the greatest
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:55.320]  pressure whenever they have whenever if they want to push some kind of agenda or ideology always
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:59.240]  comes to the left because the left has the biggest platform and it's going to intimidate and pressure
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:03.880]  them what now needs to happen is the right to have equal pressure and put the pressure on these
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:08.280]  companies such as when bright part decided to boycott kelloff when kelloff's pulled all their
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:13.640]  ad revenue form which is very bad for kelloff's and probably not a smart move you need that to come
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:19.240]  from the right as we see on the left throughout the years well let's expand on that they know it's
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:26.600]  lawsuit city so they tip to around and say hey let's boycott together a boycott you can do when
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:32.840]  you get hillary and the government and sorrow saying ban fake news don't let them advertise don't
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:38.360]  advertise with them that's an organized attempt to shut a business down and it's clearly criminal
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:44.760]  in some ways it's very un-american it's un-american to shut down a business just for the expressing
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:48.600]  their viewpoints and they try to claim that oh they're causing hate crimes there's no
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:52.680]  hate crimes there there's no violence being caused there's no illegality cause they try
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:57.720]  to use all this fantasy they don't need any basis in facts they just need the emotional appeal that
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:02.040]  oh we think this is dangerous we have to shut it down it's very un-american and that's the way
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:07.000]  you push against it i think you can launch wall suits if there is ways that they're using illegal
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:12.520]  means or ways that is against the constitution or laws that you can sue them and take them to
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:16.760]  the civil court or possibly criminal court depending on what they're doing and look somebody has to
[1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:21.240]  start somebody has to start doing it because they're in the new york timeshanks shut off info
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:25.400]  wars during the washington post saying shut it off shut it down they're in the news saying shut
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:29.240]  down drudge report you know have the federal elections commission go after them saying our
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:33.880]  speech is political so we can't have speech well we have the first amendment of course it's
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:40.360]  political i'ma skip this break let's get into your book itself and the fact that this is clearly
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:47.480]  organized and where this is coming from with the big foundations well with uh on the college
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:52.920]  campus some of this stuff is coming from the big foundations when you have the mylo riot in berkeley
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:57.480]  one of the groups was getting sponsored by a group that is funded by george sorrell so there is some
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:02.920]  organization there but a lot of this is kind of organic to the campuses but the campus culture
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:08.680]  has just kind of created these crazies who just want to advocate for this racial change that
[1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:13.880]  everything is just based on racial identity or an ethnic identity and there's just war against
[1:20:13.880 --> 1:20:19.400]  whiteness as they say so this is all a lot of this is just organically created by the campus
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:23.720]  culture that's been developed developed over the last 50 years you know this is didn't just
[1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:30.520]  pop out of a vacuum this is a long path that we've taken from you know implementing you know
[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:36.280]  studies that are only exclusive for certain ethnic groups having groups that are reserved only for
[1:20:36.280 --> 1:20:40.360]  you have to have a certain racial background in order to join this group they have these types
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:44.120]  of things that have been going on for several years now i was about to say they follow the very
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:49.960]  premise of the kkk but it's quote for minorities it's totally exclusionary towards whites
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:55.880]  fundamentally saying the color of someone's skin is a primal sin again the total opposite
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:21:01.000]  of martin luther king yeah exactly and what we're seeing now is they're creating kind of
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.640]  moral portrayal and this in no games for whiteness called victimhood culture where everybody is
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:10.760]  judged it's judged based on how much you can appeal to a victim status you're to get moral
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:16.360]  status moral value based on that so if it's not based on who has the most honor and most
[1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:20.600]  accomplishments or your dignity that comes from being an american citizen it's all about your
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:24.600]  ability to demonstrate that you're a press victim and it has nothing to do with income or
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:29.880]  social and economic status it's all having to deal with your color of your skin uh your you
[1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:33.480]  know sexual orientation all that kind of stuff all the kind of and then you put yourself into
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:38.680]  this group that has cultural controllers so you've now been divided into little subgroups
[1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:44.280]  exactly it is kind of a divided category it eventually comes up with tribal warfare this
[1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:47.880]  is what we're seeing on college campus it's everybody pitting against each other everyone's
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:52.120]  put in these groups nobody comes together for what's good for the student body or for americans as a
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:56.840]  whole it's just this is good for my little tribe and i'm going to go to war for it and i'm going
[1:21:56.840 --> 1:22:01.000]  to advocate just for my tribe i don't care about anybody else that's why they're now what we're
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:05.880]  seeing in a lot of campuses such as california state university los angeles where they're wanting
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:11.800]  segregated housing for they actually implemented segregated housing for african americans which
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:17.720]  was put forth by black activists you know this is jim pro era stuff they put this forward and it's
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:22.920]  cheaper more portable and better housing that's reserved exclusively for african americans and
[1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:26.840]  they have to do this because apparently there's too many microaggressions they have to deal with which
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:33.640]  are kind of unintended jokes and uh comments that are made that can be perceived racially uh
[1:22:33.640 --> 1:22:37.160]  progressive you've got a little bit too much reverb i really want to be able to hear what you
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:41.160]  have to say and finish up here talking about your book so i'm gonna i'm gonna put you on hold for
[1:22:41.160 --> 1:22:44.200]  just a moment to be a skype as great people see you we're going to call you up on your phone stay
[1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:48.760]  on skype let's do phone as well because the reverb is a little bit confusing there i want
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:54.680]  folks to be able to hear this ladies and gentlemen if you look at the colleges a lot of their
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:59.320]  enrollments are way down especially after they have these anti white riots and things and you
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:03.240]  know where you see the weird white female teachers leading minority groups saying whites aren't
[1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:08.040]  allowed anywhere on the school grounds and saying this is our area and you know get me some muscle
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:16.680]  over here these are wimps practicing war in an open free society of people that have been taught to
[1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:23.320]  be tolerant so we're all brought up be like dodo birds especially if you're white and a dodo bird
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:26.920]  you know they were extinct very quick after humans found their island because they would just sit
[1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:29.720]  there on the ground and wouldn't run away from it you could kill them you could kill one right in
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:35.480]  front of another dodo bird it wouldn't do anything and so the west is so open so liberal so free
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:41.000]  that in sweden they actually say i'm sorry rape me again i mean you know this is just they go to
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:48.520]  anti racism events to be raped by the uh north african uh invaders okay so this is just what's
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:53.640]  going on this is pure racism this is pure cultural you deserve to be raped because you're a white swede
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:57.400]  and then you come and give yourself as a sacrament and then you're like freaking out and once you're
[1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:03.080]  being gang raped so this is what's happening this is total Stockholm syndrome mass mental illness
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:08.840]  and they know what they're doing the controllers know what they're doing and it's meant to just
[1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:12.760]  wreck education itself they were threatened by a free press they were threatened by a great
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:17.080]  universities an open free thought but now they're banning the white boards because someone might
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:21.720]  ride on them plus they're white and they're banning images of men being masculine uh in the new
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:27.240]  transgender you know thing in national geographic there was no woman there oh here's the woman that
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:32.280]  has kids she has some value no you don't exist because you're the real enemy and so they told
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:36.920]  you who you are there and glorious down in the midst the CIA hired her they set the whole thing up
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:41.560]  to break up the family and they've done it for a pretty good job we're trying to emergency reorganize
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:45.720]  and fix things this is an attack against everybody we have to understand the people controlling this
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:51.000]  know what they're doing uh getting back to my uh guest here uh again who's author of the book we
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.800]  put up on screen uh for some of the tv viewers uh dealing with the fact that there is absolutely
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:00.200]  no campus for white men is the book scott agrier uh i've been i've been asking the questions here
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:05.160]  but what do you think overalls behind this how bad will it get before it ever uh gets better
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:08.600]  hello yes go ahead can you hear me
[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:15.080]  that's another issue people never gonna hear me over the phone um all right can you hear me now my
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:21.560]  friend i can hear you all right you're on the air go ahead hey how's it going good we're just
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:25.080]  finishing your point so i get some good audio there with you uh about your book
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:33.560]  well and yeah just so going on my book you know the reason why we had that i wrote this book is
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:37.720]  just because we saw so many crazy events that were happening on college campus the real inspiration
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:45.720]  that came from or the book was in November 2015 when we had these two incidents that happened
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:51.320]  at University of Missouri and Yale University where there was these aggressive protests uh
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.120]  University of Missouri was even worse they were able to force out their their university president
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:26:02.040]  because he had because he was apparently not doing enough with the school's racism that was
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:07.160]  apparently there was a big problem on college campus so they were able to convince over 30
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:11.960]  african-american football players to boycott any future games unless he left and they were able to
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:16.840]  force him to leave and the incidents they pointed to were not even that big of a deal they were
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:24.200]  some of them one was that they saw a marking on in a school in a dormitory bathroom and it was in
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:28.520]  the years that this is a sign of the racism we have to deal with and when i saw these incidents
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:33.960]  it just led to me to write the book on campus for right now well this is like comedians now that
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:38.440]  see highway markings there aren't even swastikas that are figure eights and they go freak out saying
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:45.640]  swastikas are everywhere i mean this is like a mental illness oh absolutely it is it is the
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:51.000]  kind of things that we see is it is mental it is mental and the way that we've seen this is
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:55.320]  what they use to suppress this speech is that somehow if you
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:00.840]  say certain ideas if you say conservative ideas on on a college campus it's not that it's just
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:05.240]  wrong and there's these facts that they'll be used to prove it it's saying this is a threat to my
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:12.040]  i'm going to die if you express this viewpoint on a college campus i am not going to survive if
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:17.240]  milo unopolis or anybody else comes on a college campus and says their point of view so they say
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:21.320]  but it's just mark of crazy people i mean the only people say that are mentally ill
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:26.200]  if you if you if you're a normal person you say i just saw something on the tv and i'm
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:29.400]  and i'm going to die because this person said that people are going to laugh at you and say
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:33.960]  you're crazy and you need help but on our college campus that's taken seriously and they're able
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:39.800]  to shut down speakers just because of this appeal that somehow their safety is threatened and then
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:46.760]  that feeds to it to where universities are now banning and so are high schools you know american
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:51.560]  flags because that triggers people american flag shirts the night circuit ruled that that was okay
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:55.560]  two years ago the same one that ruled against trump ignored the law and now we have university
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:00.440]  against banning white boards that's saying banned books because someone might write something that
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:05.720]  hurt someone's feelings you can't make that up yeah these are places where free speech is not
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:11.000]  available it it's basically suppressing speech because if any viewpoint is expressed that
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:15.480]  might hurt somebody's safety or feelings they're going to shut it down that's why the whiteboards
[1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:20.040]  i mean how are you going to express you know these are college campuses people are or pushing the
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:24.360]  envelope this is the this is young people pushing the envelope and of course they're going to write
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:28.600]  silly things on whiteboards that these are college kids but apparently because we can't have nice
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:32.760]  things we can't have fun things in college they have to shut it down it even worse they're even
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:37.080]  going after the english language at some campuses because it's two white supremacists even though
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:41.640]  it's a language we all speak but oh they're trying to get rid of the word lynch because that triggers
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:47.240]  people think they might be lynched when it's just an irish name msu banning whiteboards due to bullying
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:52.760]  again this this is so they can bully you turn everybody into basket cases and then the controllers
[1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:58.040]  in the mental ward the whole planet's a middle ward under this they then make sure there's no
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:03.000]  bullying so there's no real communication outlawing communication outlawing literature outlawing
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:08.520]  culture outlawing the species scott greer a daily caller dot com i can't wait to read the whole book

[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:18.680]  that fellow back on uh you know i gotta tell you folks mean business and we can't fall into this
[1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:22.840]  thing of being racist if we're white and think the minorities are out to get us the average quote
[1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:26.040]  minorities is like everybody else trying to have a job and the family in life and just sick of all
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:32.440]  this crap but this is what's being pushed by the social engineers and they have created just a
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:37.960]  monstrous victimology of a whole generation of people millennials who are going to call for all
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:42.680]  speech to be banned they don't agree with so see how perfect that is for the bullies to claim
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:47.880]  that you're a bully while they're bullying you we'll be back with key news straight ahead

[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:48.840]  around islamic terrorism but now the narrative has changed and it appeases liberals by allowing
[1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:55.880]  political correctness and social justice narratives to totally ruin what was once an enjoyable show

[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:34.600]  anything so we both phone calls then you know it's such a big deal to have massive censorship
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:41.880]  taking place against info wars but the levels they're doing it and under law what's being done
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:48.760]  is massive civil rights violation massive discrimination just open and shut but it's
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:52.040]  being pushed by the mainstream media it's being pushed by the big foundations it's being pushed
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.000]  by some of the courts uh the fourth circuit in fact i sent this to nico he probably gave it to me
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.040]  ruled against the second amendment uh two days ago on monday i didn't even know about that till
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:06.440]  this morning i was on raw story where they were celebrating you know attacks on me and i saw them
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:10.120]  celebrating that and i went and read the ruling it was just like they said guns that aren't for
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:15.400]  hunting or banned and you can't have a gun that could be military uh that's the exact gun you need
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:23.640]  and so semi autos can all be banned that's the people i'm not just up here saying we're still
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:30.360]  in a fight you know we're in big trouble you know keep tuning in because you know trump's
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:36.040]  saying everything's okay and i just want to you know keep the audience quite frankly if trump
[1:35:36.040 --> 1:35:39.720]  wasn't being opposed like this was actually able to stabilize things we just do the four-hour show
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:43.240]  that's a lot of nightly news there's still be plenty to cover fight for freedom but i wouldn't be
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:49.160]  hyperventilating desperate totally freaked out i mean i am just i feel sick right now okay i don't
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:54.760]  want to be on air right now okay i mean it doesn't make me want to quit but it fundamentally makes me
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:01.480]  want to up our game even more to a very frustrating level is what i'm saying when you've got massive
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:07.320]  hordes of people banning books banning chalkboards banning speech attacking women everywhere
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:12.680]  attacking families trying to go to the inauguration looking like rat like scum just crazed out of some
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:21.880]  movie like they're in some devil cult and lies everywhere and bullying and death threats and
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:29.240]  open economic sabotage and just all sorts of other bizarre behavior the public has become satanic
[1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:36.760]  narcissistic twisted disconnected lazy spoiled stupid and they just love company and the globalists
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:44.360]  have helped create this mess and they've now just organized these giant throngs of goblin like dumb
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:51.960]  asses that are the biggest victims of this system and the globalists write all these white papers
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:58.280]  and books how they've done it to people and they engage in such incredibly fundamental lies constantly
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:04.680]  it makes my head spin but here's the good news we would be in so much trouble right now trump
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:08.200]  what nin and they're really having to reveal themselves right now in their attempts to stop
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:13.160]  him and get him out they are so panic they wanted those next four supreme court justices
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:18.520]  they wanted to further bankrupt the economy and consolidate control they wanted to kind of have their
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:27.080]  losers get to play army scenario where they play you know cowardly culture war and totally
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:34.040]  destroy what's left of humanity and the family but humanity is kicking back in coming from behind
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:40.840]  and having massive gains but when i just see how they bitch and complain because christians don't
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:49.960]  want to rent their house to a homosexual couple and then okay you can debate whether that's right
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:53.640]  or not that could be discriminatory i mean i'm kind of libertarian i see where that's going
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:58.440]  but then what are those folks aren't tolerant you see of their christianity
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:05.160]  you know in a room or whatever i mean you know who do you really want in your house maybe you love
[1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:09.560]  people that are gay maybe you hate them the point is is that that individual right to say i like this
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:14.040]  restaurant not that restaurant because that is discrimination i like green peas i don't like
[1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:18.440]  black eyed peas i mean i like both but i'm just using this analogy
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:24.680]  so discrimination just means you know you you choose a road you think's a quicker bear
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:29.160]  better way to go somewhere that's discriminatory discrimination's walking down a path not stepping
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:35.880]  a hole discrimination's picking a girl you want to try to go out with but they tell you don't have
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:40.760]  discrimination just take on the values we want to give you then their values are pure cultural death
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:46.040]  so okay somebody in seattle doesn't want to bake a cake
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:51.480]  for somebody that want to have you know their gay cake or whatever the rainbow on it
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:58.360]  you could argue you're open for business civil rights act the rest of it that's one step away
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:03.560]  from telling you know black folks they can't come in your restaurant but then what if somebody wanted
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:10.040]  you to make a kkkk see starts getting a little hard to hard differentiate there i quite frankly i
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:14.920]  think it was a setup of i owned a bakery somebody walked in said make a kkkk i'd say what is it you
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:20.840]  know make your own kkkk or how about i make you the cake and you you i sell you the icing
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:26.040]  and then you do it yourself what if somebody came in and said i want you to you know put a big
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:31.960]  men's member on it they're being tasted people don't want to do that because they're christians
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:35.560]  the point is if it's a small mom and pop kind of leave them alone you know what i mean i think
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:40.120]  chains and folks have to follow pretty open policy but they can have policies as well but you can't
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:46.040]  argue we got a policy that we just adopted that you can't be political and have advertising claiming
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:49.800]  that you're violating the federal elections commission because that's how they said they'd go
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:55.240]  after us and rudge when i'm advertising supplements and water filters that's what our advertisement
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:40:01.240]  was through google and ad roll not ad blade the names are similar to different groups ad roll
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:07.560]  and they just said you know you're fake news you put out this information no judge no jury no
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:11.080]  ruling we just dehumanize you and a three-year relationship it's gone
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:19.080]  because of potentially sensitive information you hurt somebody's feelings we don't tell you what
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:24.840]  we what you did we don't tell you anything we just say that your relationship with us
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:29.880]  it brought in three point three million dollars in profit that's profit in that program not profit
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:34.520]  in info wars and free speech systems but but profit to fund us because that's what we do
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:45.000]  well frankly if i wasn't doing this i'd be doing other things for money and i'd be happy with the
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.640]  money i had and i shouldn't have to even say that it doesn't matter it's a free market system
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.000]  i want you to be successful i want to be successful the problem is those of us

[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:29.800]  did it then we went to over 40 million a week and i said we do it and now we're going to over 100
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:34.040]  million and some weeks we've got 80 plus and that's real numbers and they're scared because they
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:40.840]  know info wars is one of the biggest media events in the world we're on thousands of platforms
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.520]  because we faced censorship before and we're all about total diversity and it's a war if they can

[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:58.040]  what's happening last night in sweden isn't it strange how all the leftists who mocked trump
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:05.400]  about his last night in sweden quote are suddenly so quiet about what happened last night in sweden
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:10.680]  men in a migrant suburb of stock home rioted burned cars and attacked reporters shopkeepers and police
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:16.200]  officers because cops arrested a drug dealer so i put out a challenge for lefties who thought that
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:22.040]  sweden's crime-ridden suburbs were safe to visit themselves prompting a bunch of d-rate celebrities
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:27.800]  to shamelessly virtue signal about how progressive they are the kind of people who live in the white
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:33.720] est areas possible and would f**k themselves if they went anywhere near an islamic ghetto unlike
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:39.320]  yours truly who got chased out of want mollambique days after the paris massacre my challenge was
[1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:45.400]  accepted by tim pool who was then told by other left-wing journalists not to investigate sweden's
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:51.480]  migrant suburbs really journalists scared of someone doing journalism but if sweden's migrant
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:57.880]  suburbs are so culturally enriched and safe as you claim what are you afraid of the truth the
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:03.800]  truth about a country that's so safe it holds the proud honor of being the rape capital of europe
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:09.720]  a country where rapes are so commonplace that migrant culprits laugh at their victims as they
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:34.600]  report it to the police i mean it's so safe that turkish government newspapers are placing ads
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:40.120]  warning their citizens about it sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that when television crews
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  visit them to prove that they're safe they're physically attacked by migrants the police leave
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:53.880]  and as we prepare to go young men masking their faces arrive good you're doing good yeah okay
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:51:06.120]  hey all right good okay you too and attack
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:20.440]  there's no need to be unkind the gang's attention turns when a local intervenes
[1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:28.120]  and drives his mobility scooter into the most violent attack we've been individually attacked
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:34.200]  son man has been punched the producer's been punched you've been run over the cameraman
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.520]  we've all been assaulted and insulted sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that filmmakers
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:45.160]  fear for their lives as they're assaulted on the street while we were setting up a shoot at a
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:51.080]  neighboring location we were approached by five men and told to leave while my crew took off i
[1:51:51.080 --> 1:51:57.160]  stayed to simply ask why we had to leave because i was still wired we had the sound of what happened
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:15.320]  next how come it's a problem to uh to film here i don't want to be filmed i know but why what's the what's the
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:25.080]  i don't thank god we got a second amendment these mommies aren't too tolerant folks
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:29.720]  be kidnapped in five minutes in their country they've got a survival statement
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:35.320]  sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that ambulance workers are demanding riot gear
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:41.000]  to go anywhere near them sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that swedish citizens are demanding
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:46.360]  bulletproof vests while the government tries to ban them sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:55.800]  that there are 55 no-go zones the vast majority of which are migrant suburbs there are now 55 declared
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:53:02.840]  no-go zones in sweden where police have to escort ambulances to ensure their safety oh but the police
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:08.920]  do go there so how dare you call them no-go zones yeah they go there and they're attacked with rocks
[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:15.640]  and missiles that's not safe sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that pro-immigration swedish
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:21.960]  politicians and celebrities live nowhere near them sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that in some
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:28.120]  areas meter maids have just stopped going sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that maintenance
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:34.120]  companies have refused to service customers who live there sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:40.840]  that some Somali immigrants want to leave because their violence plagued homeland is safer sweden's
[1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:46.920]  migrant suburbs are so safe that immigrant-led riots and mass burning of cars is commonplace
[1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:59.000]  including last night in sweden sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that malmo is known as sweden
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:04.760]  chicago it's one of the most dangerous cities in the whole of western europe with a murder rate higher
[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:11.000]  than paris and london malmo has a foreign population of around 43 percent and areas like rosen god and
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:17.160]  90 percent muslim but i'm sure that's just a coincidence 42-year-old police veteran chief
[1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:22.600]  superintendent torsten elofson says that migrants comprise the majority of people being arrested
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:29.400]  in the city he also says that explosions and grenade attacks are routine as a form of intimidation
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:34.360]  and swedes are so pleased with the impact that mass immigration has had on their country
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:41.400]  that the far-right anti-immigrant sweden democrats party has risen from relative obscurity to be
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:54.760]  almost number one in the polls if there's no problem with mass immigration why has their support doubled
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:00.760]  integration of immigrants in sweden has been so successful that 53 percent of prisoners serving
[1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:06.040]  long-term sentences in sweden have a foreign background integration of immigrants in sweden
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:11.720]  has been so successful that veteran police officer peter springer says that almost every suspect
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:17.400]  involved in a serious violent crime is called mohammed or another islamic name integration
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:25.160]  of immigrants in sweden has been so successful that less than 500 out of 160 000 refugees who
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:31.240]  arrived in 2016 have a job integration of immigrants in sweden has been so successful
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:37.960]  that half of all jobless are foreigners integration of immigrants in sweden has been so successful
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:44.920]  that 58 percent of welfare payments go to migrants integration of immigrants in sweden has been so
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:51.080]  successful that isis flags have been legalized and returning jihadists are being considered for
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:56.360]  welfare payments integration of immigrants in sweden has been so successful that migrants
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:02.760]  are raping women are anti-racism festivals over the past two years dozens of young women some
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:08.440]  as young as 12 were raped at these festivals across sweden by hundreds of young immigrants
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:13.960]  they use the tactic where dozens of men surround one or more girls in circles while the men in
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:19.320]  the inner circle sexually attacks their victims the outer circle distracts and keeps out anyone who
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:25.480]  would stop it the attacks have become so common that some bands most notably mumford and sons
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:31.560]  refuse to play in sweden this has happened multiple times and to multiple victims then the
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:36.520]  issue is that when it is reported this was widely known by the people who were there the police
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:42.280]  that was on the scene but then it was they put the lid on it so we they covered it up they covered
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:48.280]  it up integration of immigrants in sweden has been so successful that preschool kids are playing
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:53.560]  isis games integration of immigrants in sweden has been so successful that the words pray to
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:57:00.280]  ala or die alongside an isis flag was spray painted on the side of a school integration of
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:06.280]  immigrants in sweden has been so successful that an isis supporter was employed as an immigration
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:11.480]  officer the huffington post claims that deadly crime has decreased over time in sweden the new
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:17.480]  york times also claimed crime was decreasing and that's fake news lethal violence has increased
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:25.960]  29 percent since 2014 sex crimes have doubled since 2012 gun violence has increased 84 percent
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:31.400]  over the last nine years all the sources for those stats are in the description below the swedish
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:35.960]  government does not record the ethnicity of those involved in crime reports the huffington post
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:42.840]  oh gee i wonder why that is i wonder why they stopped producing reports on this back in 2005
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:50.200]  could it possibly be because the 2005 report showed immigrants to be vastly overrepresented
[1:57:50.200 --> 1:57:57.080]  in crime stats could it be because immigrants were 5.5 times more likely to carry out rape could
[1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:02.280]  the lack of statistics relating to migrant crimes be anything to do with the fact that police have

[1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:28.040]  the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:32.600]  from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that produces the
[1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:38.760]  blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence i'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:43.320]  were but i'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is
[1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:47.560]  a big part of it i know you're gonna want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:59:47.560 --> 2:00:03.480]  infowarslife.com today you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:21.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones there's no doubt the people
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:25.480]  we're up against are not misguided they know exactly what they're doing they can look at the
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:31.080]  demographics of the planet seven percent of the world's white it's a bunch of white globalists
[2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:35.480]  that want to bring in third world populations turn them into race-based systems and then
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:41.400]  absolutely divide and conquer society break up the family you name it i'm gonna have millie weaver
[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:47.080]  and leon macadoo we're gonna be hosting two hours today of the marathon broadcast as we fight for
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:51.640]  free speech popping in with their view on this and more at the bottom of the hour jordan maxwell
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:57.160]  is joining us just about the whole globalist agenda and the more esoteric side to all of that
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:02.440]  but it's all these guests all these people all these ideas that the system would like to block
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:09.240]  you know i feel dirty and by dirty like when i've seen somebody die in a car wreck you know like
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:13.800]  for a day or two you feel gross not that you did anything wrong just being in the proximity to the
[2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:18.360]  you know seeing a guy get his head chopped off flying out of a corvette they even think about it
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:23.720]  now makes me feel just grungy and like i'm sick of it and i want to get away from it and i know
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:28.520]  why people punch out of this stuff and stop fighting because it's like you're tired of looking at
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:33.240]  globalists and their minions just let them be a bunch of scum losers move out in the country as far
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:36.840]  as you can try to stay away they're coming after everybody the globalists said they're not going
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:39.960]  to let you live in the country they're coming after christians they're coming after everybody
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:44.360]  and they've got all the poor minorities in the inner cities just brainwashing the hell out of them
[2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:52.760]  and it's so sad and i realized the reason i'm so mad about this ad role in google banning us
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:57.480]  from advertising on on their platforms saying we're subhumans and don't exist and violate our
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:03.960]  civil rights is that this is only the beginning people keep saying hey we won oh and shroyer was
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:08.200]  like hey we won we got trumpin they're now just exploding 10 times worse we're just in the fight
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:15.400]  of our lives we know how bad they were for sure now but they're blocking everything he wants to do
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:19.000]  trying to cause a depression it's criminal what they're doing i
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:24.280]  uh people better pray for donald trump they better hope he gets his agenda through because
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:31.960]  let me tell you this is cut and dry let's finish paul watches report sweden just to face so nice it
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:38.680]  used to face so good you look at what's happening last night in sweden i tried to wait for you
[2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:44.680]  but you have lost your mind isn't it strange how all the leftists who mocked trump about his
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:50.280]  last night in sweden quote are suddenly so quiet it's good we got a lot of feed and that's just
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:54.840]  the way things roll actually started from the start of the report uh the conclusion of paul's
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:03:02.120]  that it's it's got time to do it now still no we don't okay here you go we're talking about
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:08.440]  grown migrants being put in the same schools as 13 year old girls the results are always the same
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:14.280]  there's molestations there's rape attempts there's sexual harassment it's crazy what's happening in
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:21.400]  sweden is nothing short of crazy i live here i can read swedish unless we highlight the negatives
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:27.480]  we can't change the negatives nothing is gonna get better if we just ignore problems and act like
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:33.800]  everything is fine and don't give me that about islamophobia okay i have a muslim background
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:39.720]  i don't have a problem with reasonable muslims i have a problem with immigration policy i have a
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:45.880]  problem with irresponsible politics and bad decisions by politicians that's my problem and
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:52.920]  now we're seeing these big media headlines about how sweden has no clue what trump is talking about
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:04:00.680]  so he must just be a big old dummy that's sweden knows exactly what trump is talking about if they
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:07.560]  were to see his whole speech in its full context they could probably figure out what he's referring
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:14.360]  to forget last night in sweden what about the last couple of years in sweden or the last decade in
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:21.000]  sweden they're not lying there is a huge problem with crime and rapes and sex attacks sexual assaults
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:28.280]  molestations related to migrants you really want to pick a fight with us over immigration and your
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:37.160]  example is sweden you really want to pretend that because donald trump made a gaffe that means
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:42.600]  sweden is totally safe and doesn't have a problem with mass immigration trump's only real mistake
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:49.240]  was to specify one night in sweden this is happening almost every night and the islamist
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:55.800]  aligned left won't tell you about it because it shatters their utopian bubble that mass immigration
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:05:04.360]  works it will be back stay with us the new season of homeland is now available on showtime and it
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:10.760]  features an obnoxious internet radio talk show host that is obviously supposed to represent
[2:05:10.760 --> 2:05:17.480]  alex jones and info wars in the latest episode the alex jones character is seen ranting and
[2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:25.720]  raving about a terrorist attack in new york a bomb going off in the streets of new york city again
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:32.680]  the more i think about that the angrier i get i mean i am sitting here i am so upset i can barely
[2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:40.840]  speak boom this alex jones parody takes homeland in a new direction this season as earlier plots
[2:05:40.840 --> 2:05:48.040]  usually focused around islamic terrorism but now the narrative has changed and it appeases liberals
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:54.440]  by allowing political correctness and social justice narratives to totally ruin what was once

[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:22.040]  the donation buttons and whether it's $20 or more it takes a lot to set up a washington
[2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:25.800]  bureau and actually be able to ask questions there at the winehouse press briefings and change the
[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:30.360]  world it actually takes money to have investigative journalists and studios and do this and guess what
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:36.280]  we built it we did it and now some weeks we have upwards of 80 plus million 85 million
[2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:40.120]  viewers usually it's about 45 50 million they know that the new york times of the story monday
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:45.400]  and said okay he does have the billions of views on youtube he says he does have 40 plus
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:49.560]  million a week they went and looked it's okay extra in fact it's probably worse than he's saying
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:55.480]  there's more and so boom we were banned off google and that's how they can just ban you anytime
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:10:59.400]  they want they're already lowering us in the rankings and the message everybody else is
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:03.480]  shut up or you'll go the way of alex shone's probably done to me because they think you're
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:08.920]  cowards and they think you'll go oh we better shut up we better not say anything in fact i was
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:15.720]  talking just last week to one of my crew members whose son works for a large outdoor supply company
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:21.400]  a well-known name they on their facebook just said something about it's good to see job numbers up
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:26.920]  make america great again they got banned on their facebook that has millions of followers
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:33.400]  for a day saying in fact i asked him to give me the report they told me about if i'm going to
[2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:38.360]  report on this i just get so busy it said it's not nice to upset people with political stuff
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:43.240]  you just need to enjoy your business like you're banned for a day you like making money be able
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:47.400]  to advertise with us and be on a platform with us they spend money with facebook we're gonna ban
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:52.440]  you you do that again just you don't talk about it's good job numbers are up for the first time
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:12:01.320]  since 1984 at those numbers you sit down and you shut up so that's the point we've gotten to so
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:05.720]  we're trying to show them the power of our audience we can win but you have to spread the
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:09.720]  articles the videos which you've been doing you have to buy the products because that's why
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:14.280]  we don't even have a lot of big sponsors we have our own products which we then go out and advertise
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:18.280]  outside of the audience to come fund this operation and that's what makes them mad
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:25.000]  so i've already been talking to lawyers it looks like we're going to have to sue and i don't like
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.840]  to sue people but you know we're sending a letter to them to back off because i mean you know if i
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:34.120]  try to set up a restaurant it wouldn't let black people eat at it that'd be wrong too and i'd say
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:38.680]  well you're just fake news it's not that you're black it's that you know it's that you're conservative
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:43.320]  well well how is that okay i'm gonna go to jordan maxwell our guest for the hour a little bit in
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:48.520]  the next if you can do it and then popping in is leon macadoo and of course i'm only we were to
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:53.160]  tell us what's coming up tonight when they host two hours and i'm doing a reddit ask me anything
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:57.400]  when i come back at eight o'clock tonight for an hour or so then taking your phone calls tonight
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:02.280]  the streams are on facebook the streams are on youtube uh we have our continual stream at info
[2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:07.240]  wars dot com forward slash show uh jordan i know you were coming on to talk about the globalists
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:10.760]  and their programs and and i don't know your view on this yet i know you're hosting your own show
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:15.160]  every week which is great and it's good to see you you know take an action you've done so much over
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:21.480]  50 years but clearly the mega banks are against trump clearly he's trying to get small jobs going
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:25.320]  clearly they're trying to block him and saying kill him i'm not saying he's perfect and if you
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:30.280]  disagree with me tell me because you know we're not a cult here i want to know but they are trying
[2:13:30.280 --> 2:13:34.040]  to destroy him they're trying to destroy me they're doing stuff behind the scenes i know you've
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:37.960]  been through a lot as well that we don't want to talk about because it just adds to it you know to
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:42.680]  kind of speak it out there is what they want and their whole lesser magic paradigm but but for people
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:47.400]  that don't know how the globalist operate what are we winning with the awakening is why they're
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:52.440]  panicking or are they just bullying because they think they're assured of victory and you know
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:57.720]  their own people beating women up everywhere banning free speech banning books oh chop boards
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:01.880]  are being banned at colleges because someone might write something on them i mean this is beyond
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:07.880]  banning books this is banning words it shows us this cult who is this cult what do they want

[2:14:28.520 --> 2:14:35.480]  on air jordan maxwell show dot com go ahead yes and and again thank you for having me on uh back
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:45.640]  in 1967 i made a startling discovery i was doing a lot of research back in the early 60s on uh on
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:57.080]  all the isms communism marxism fascism etc and i came across something in 1967 in glendale california
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:05.880]  in a library there that's caught my attention because i have been for many years lecturing
[2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:13.880]  starting back in 1960 61 giving lectures and talks on the secret societies in world government
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:25.320]  religion etc and i was doing some research on the soviet union and i come across an article in the
[2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:31.720]  world book encyclopedia and it was talking about the soviet union russia before the revolution
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:37.560]  etc and then at the bottom of the page in the world book encyclopedia on the soviet union
[2:15:37.560 --> 2:15:45.320]  there was a picture actually two pictures one was the picture of the national coat of arms
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:52.440]  of the soviet union and the second was their flag the soviet communist flag and there was a little
[2:15:52.440 --> 2:16:00.360]  article maybe just a couple sentences on both pictures and when i read the little article
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:09.160]  about the soviet national coat of arms it struck me that this was something of momentous importance
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:16.200]  but i didn't understand what it was but i knew instinctively this is going to be important
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:25.400]  and so i began researching the soviet coat of arms um it's an it's an incredible story
[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:33.160]  that and i'm i continue to get a lot of information coming in on this all the time but
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:42.040]  the point being is that i talked with you quite a few years ago about my work on this one subject
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:50.760]  and uh exactly that's the symbol and you will see the the the reefs of wheat around the earth
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:57.800]  and the sun rising behind the earth uh that is exactly what i'm talking about well
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:06.440]  i discovered uh the more i looked into this that this was a subject which is being used by
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:15.640]  everyone in every culture of the world not just this particular picture but the conceptual idea
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:23.240]  and uh and the and the actual terms that were in the encyclopedia talking about this symbol
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:31.640]  the words and the terms that are associated with this symbol for world communism uh is everywhere
[2:17:31.640 --> 2:17:40.440]  it's in hollywood motion pictures television shows police departments uh universities
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:47.000]  um children's cartoons in the morning what does it stand for what is their in game because it looks
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  like it's no language brave new world a bunch of mindless zombies so humanity just rolls over and
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:59.080]  dies it appears to be some off-world extermination virus program to train us to kill ourselves
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:08.440]  it's it is a hidden symbol which dominates the entire world it is in every country of the world
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:15.480]  it is all over america and our federal governments our state governments in our county and city
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:22.040]  emblems of our cities and counties this is the most extraordinary story you're ever going to
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:26.760]  hear alex there i know you've heard them all but you haven't heard let's get into it i've we've
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:30.280]  talked about this a long time ago but the audience probably doesn't know about it go ahead yeah well
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:36.840]  you and i talked about this a long time ago and i told you then that i wanted to do a video on this
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.120]  subject that's right you were actually scared to even talk about it on air but let's just get it out
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:47.000]  there yeah we'll do a video it is that that's exactly right i was frightened because i realized
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:52.760]  the significance of how big this thing really is and what it was actually saying
[2:18:54.440 --> 2:19:00.600]  and so i've done a finally i finally i got a video done i i've got two videos but i've got
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:10.760]  uh this one uh on this side here is the cosmocrats it's dealing with this subject right now
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:20.840]  cosmocrats the idea is that um well in the bible in Ephesians six one christians will
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:27.480]  remember that in Ephesians six one let me bring it over here so you can see it not of this world
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:32.600]  yes rulers of this darkness we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:37.240]  against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual right wickedness
[2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:45.080]  in high places now the very word rulers of the of darkness implies that the darkness over this
[2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:49.880]  earth has rulers people who know what they're doing i understand i understand that's what the
[2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:54.280]  elite believe is they're getting off world knowledge to control people and uh whether you
[2:19:54.280 --> 2:19:58.120]  believe in this or not the elites do believe in it jordan maxwell you can find the new film at

[2:24:08.760 --> 2:24:12.840]  yeah i remember jordan talking years ago about making a film with me and i just quite frankly
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:17.160]  i'm too busy to do it i'm interesting material really key to what the globalist believe and think
[2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:21.000]  uh but i'm glad he's got it out of you know he's coming on about this today so i wouldn't
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:25.560]  ask him right now if you get it his uh website i seem not in his head jordan max will show
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:29.880]  dot com but whether you believe in this or not the globalists believe they're getting off world
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:35.000]  or interdimensional communications they believe they're building all this under orders that they'll
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:39.320]  be given eternal life by merging with machines now i would tell you that 20 years ago people
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:43.880]  laughed i would tell you that 10 years ago an in-game like nine and a half years ago and the
[2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:47.480]  new york times even last year made fun of me saying he believes that they're gonna merge the
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:52.520]  machines become gods i was quoting ray Kurzweil now it's all over the news so folks don't laugh
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:57.960]  you see it movies culture kind of avatar like possession voodoo whatever but you know jacking
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:02.840]  into people whether you believe in this or not the elite that's what rituals are about is about
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:07.720]  being possessed so i love that they always have news articles like i'm a cook when a billion plus
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:12.040]  christians believe this catholics believe it the muslims believe it every african tribe believes
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:17.160]  that the the the japanese believe it and of course he's never even given a secret shot
[2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:21.160]  from his perspective on their research i want to see the film here as a plug for it but
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:25.800]  you got a short segment here a long segment coming up jordan give us the data dump i mean i mean
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:29.400]  have i kind of guessed what you're getting because i've done my own research but from your own deep
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:36.760]  research expand on this why people need to be aware of this well because what has really uh
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:45.080]  uh just uh frightened me over this entire subject is the fact that the same terms
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:55.400]  and the same emblem symbol and terms connected to that symbol has been used all over the earth
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:59.080]  but i understand so you're you were saying this even before movies like prometheus came out
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:03.480]  you're saying everywhere this is the key symbol what the black son of the nazis i mean what are
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:11.240]  we getting at oh we're talking about a sunrise between two mountains it goes back to ancient
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:18.280]  egypt and can most likely go back even further to hindu but it's two stars the sun and then another
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:25.560]  sign that gets into the whole 2001 lucifer being united yes but what we're what we generally think
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:32.920]  of as luciferianism is a very deep subject really just alien worship isn't it it's an
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:41.880]  extraordinary subject that has not really been looked at and examined uh fully today but i'm
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:49.800]  telling you that there is a world of occultism already built up around us before we were born
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:55.080]  already in government sure it's a total language they're even taking away our basic language
[2:26:55.080 --> 2:27:00.280]  we can't even understand their language which is openly all around us all of it it's everywhere
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:05.960]  but but what frightens me is the fact that all of the american presidents since i've been alive
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:14.040]  have used that symbol have used that term that's associated with that symbol and then when i see
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:19.960]  all over the world world leaders institutions let me bring this up what did you think of
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:26.200]  trump's inaugural where he said bring god back in bring the light back in our birthright human
[2:27:26.200 --> 2:27:31.320]  birthright humans the world for humans i thought it was a major declaration against the powers of
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:38.760]  darkness it was and that's why i knew i i knew with an instancy that i knew that he was going to be
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:47.000]  uh attacked and uh and i knew that he was going to have one hell of a time because
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  he is going up against something that has been around for thousands of years and let's be clear
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.680]  occult just means hidden you're an occultist because you studied the occult you're bringing
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:01.400]  it you say i'm an occultist it just means we study the hidden it's clear watching trump and i know
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:04.840]  you're one of the top occult experts out there is it not clear he knows a lot more than he's saying
[2:28:05.400 --> 2:28:15.000]  oh yeah you have no idea how far deep this goes what he's actually up against uh it's it's so
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:20.920]  frightening when you see hollywood making movies about this particular occult symbol
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:28.600]  that you see it as used the symbol and terms are used by the communist party the nazi party fascist
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:35.560]  throughout the world you begin to see how this is a worldwide movement and it's movement from my
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:40.760]  research haven't seen your film yet is it not a movement to create the end of humanity exterminism
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:49.080]  and the new man that is exactly what it is it is a well-planned ancient symbol and an idea and as
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:53.880]  i said in the beginning it's like a satanic cultural transmission for us to commit suicide
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:29:01.480]  absolutely and it is and it's so obvious once you see it oh it's a world killing it's a world
[2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:06.040]  killing interdimensional transmission there's no doubt about that because of even what the
[2:29:06.040 --> 2:29:12.680]  scripture says it says that against we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities
[2:29:12.680 --> 2:29:18.600]  against powers against the world governors and princes of the darkness and against spiritual
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:24.760]  wickedness in high places high this is what the world does not seem to get and now they got the
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:30.120]  satellites in orbit building the machine whether you believe it or not folks this is what the elite
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:35.400]  believe look at Prometheus all of it they tell you that's their real religion and the elite believe
[2:29:35.400 --> 2:29:41.080]  they're gonna ascend to be the engineers and this whole planet is just a bio weapons facility
[2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:49.400]  and all of us way off on the edge of the universe the weapons factory very dangerous we'll be back
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:55.960]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:59.880 --> 2:30:06.520]  the new season of homeland is now available on showtime and it features an obnoxious internet
[2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:13.560]  radio talk show host that is obviously supposed to represent alex jones and info wars in the
[2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:19.960]  latest episode the alex jones character is seen ranting and raving about a terrorist attack
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:27.320]  in new york a bomb going off in the streets of new york city again the more i think about that
[2:30:27.320 --> 2:30:36.760]  the angrier i get i mean i am sitting here i am so upset i can barely speak boom this alex jones parody
[2:30:36.760 --> 2:30:43.240]  takes homeland in a new direction this season as earlier plots usually focused around islamic
[2:30:43.240 --> 2:30:50.280]  terrorism but now the narrative has changed and it appeases liberals by allowing political correctness

[2:34:15.480 --> 2:34:21.000]  not about do this or do that trump is the real deal and he's not perfect but he is totally
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:27.160]  surrounded he has goodwill towards people and we have been hit by the google subsidiary group

[2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:41.800]  but to people on the the the adro platform and they said you're fake news and you're bad people

[2:34:54.760 --> 2:35:01.080]  conservative i'm a libertarian i'm a christian i'm a patriot sue me if i'm fake no i'm not fake
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:06.280]  beginning to esoteric things maybe once a week the rest of it's covering what's happening in the
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:10.920]  world mass burnings and rapes in sweden the president talks about it they say that's fake news
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:16.760]  no it's not we showed you all the newspapers and news feeds mainstream news out of sweden so
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:21.000]  they don't like us because we call them they don't like drudge because he'll show
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:25.560]  obama going obama care is free you can keep your doctor then it cuts him two years later
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:29.880]  go i never said that they want the federal elections commission to shut that down that's
[2:35:29.880 --> 2:35:33.480]  what their letter said they said you're political and we can't take political advertising what
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:37.400]  i went looked up adro does take political advertising from packs and political parties
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:41.880]  they were claiming i was doing it illegally as a super pack when i'm not one because i'm promoting
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:46.280]  the second amendment i sure wish i was getting money from second amendment groups i do it because
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:51.640]  i believe in and that's what we promote so they're saying my views are political and are under the
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:56.200]  federal elections commission that doesn't even have jurisdiction it's just made up but see hillary
[2:35:56.200 --> 2:36:01.480]  had been claiming that and she said she wanted me and drudge shut down so the big enemy is
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:05.960]  donald trump matt rudge and all chunks i'm not trying to set myself up here is one of the big
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:10.600]  kingpins in this it's just happened that way because we've built something that now reaches
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:16.200]  45 million people conservatively away i'm great at reaching people i'm bad at bringing in money
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:21.960]  i've got millions of dollars of bandwidth cost and the hundreds of thousands of it cost a quarter
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:26.840]  i'm trying to build new up-to-date sites i'm trying to launch a lot of stuff this is there's
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:34.120]  nowhere you could spend your money and fight harder infowarstore.com go there get the films
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:38.760]  get the books get the non-zmo heirloom seeds get the water filtration get a three-month supply
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:43.400]  for my patriot the best company out there get a free alexa pure 200 plus dollar gravity fed

[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:01.800]  print it's totally exclusive those are at 1995 i sold out a half of them once in one day and said
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:07.160]  i'm going to 50 bucks well maybe we should just go up to fund the operation it was in 1995 sounds
[2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:11.400]  like a lot of money selling thousands of these and making like 10 bucks it doesn't do it when you
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.400]  have crews when you actually pay people living wages when you actually jump to the hoops and get
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:21.080]  the insurance when you pay people to fly over the country and open washington bureau i cannot
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:24.360]  stress to you how important it is to have our people there asking questions our people they're
[2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:28.360]  covering the media's deception like james oak keeps coming on the next few days who's got
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:34.440]  the big network cnn it's a word you know just all over their newsrooms lying cheating deceiving

[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:08.520]  to jordan in a moment but ladies i wanted to bring in here you're in there researching you're
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:13.640]  getting ready you're watching this i made a big deal out of it when the federal elections commission
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:17.880]  was saying we should shut down drudge i made i'm not bragging but i have an instinct to hang
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:22.120]  together i'm not stupid they were saying shut down liberals i'd say don't do it because that's
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:27.800]  that once they go we go right um all these labels mean nothing anyways i was really freaked out when
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:33.560]  bright bart had its its apps deleted and taken off and by apple is just saying you're fake news
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:37.000]  oh yeah with the white house advisor and more readers of the new york times and you know all
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:40.840]  the rest of it they just label us and turn us into subhumans like hitler did the jews that's
[2:41:40.840 --> 2:41:44.440]  what happened they said you can't do business you can't speak you can't write the newspaper now
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:49.560]  years before they actually rounded them up this is what they do this is so unamerican
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:54.200]  so dangerous and i'm i was like a chicken with my head cut off about reddit getting censored and
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:59.000]  facebook starting to censor and them announcing they're going to start censoring only drudge has
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:02.360]  made a big deal out of it it's it's really crazy even bright bart hardly makes a big deal up well
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:07.160]  listen the hit we took is a lot bigger than Kellogg's pulling out a bright part that was some ad
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:12.040]  share where they were buying a few ads on there maybe a few thousand dollars a month this is our
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:19.080]  entire outside advertising program that we practiced for years that that that was the extra money from
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:24.360]  last year to fund expansion this year people go oh well you'll need to expand you start contracting
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:28.840]  you die who wants to give in to them bullying everybody trying to shut down free speech everywhere
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:32.200]  who wants to give it to them beating up women all over the country who wants to give in to them
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:38.600]  with homeland characters that are me who then frame people for bombings they say exactly what i say
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:44.840]  and then have me framing people for bombings on fiction shows talk about fake news they've
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:51.960]  got fake tv hit shows admitting it's about alex jones saying destroy me but there's a battle
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:55.960]  chris carter himself says i'm good the new characters based on me and says i'm doing good
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:43:00.440]  so there's a battle going on as they'd say in the system we'll talk about that with max well but
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:04.840]  then rise shotgun with me ladies into the next hour if you want but what do you think of this
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:08.840]  being here leon you've been here almost four years or more you've been here just three or four months
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:14.040]  milley what do you make of being here and seeing this happen well you know alex i really feel like
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:20.520]  we are seeing the beginnings of a coup attempt in america right now all these things happening all
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:25.800]  at once it just seems too suspicious for it all to be happening at once you know them attacking
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:30.680]  info wars milo unopolis and so on and so forth they admit they're doing them they're launching a
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:37.000]  censorship rollout right exactly and you know what this really makes me think about is nobody
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:43.720]  ever announced who won the cold war so was it still going on and are we seeing the the remnants of
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:50.440]  the lasting effects of the soviet russians coming here with the kbg and you know really trying to
[2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:56.600]  infiltrate american grassroots groups like the weather underground and get these young influential
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:44:01.240]  what's funny is the soviets did with with bankers in the u.s funding it come here to foment a
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:05.880]  bolshevik style deal that kind of failed but the very thought processes of that even though russia
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:10.920]  may not be involved now is what we're actually facing here right and they admit this is classic
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:16.360]  soviet style tactics really great point yeah exactly so are we seeing this soviet influence
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:20.840]  popping back up through people like hillary clinton or obama trying to push that agenda
[2:44:20.840 --> 2:44:27.640]  and is that maybe why vladimir putin was so against hillary coming into power because that could
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:32.520]  have been a hand of that old soviet influence right we got these antifa groups and all the
[2:44:32.520 --> 2:44:38.200]  fascist groups and the pro-communist groups coming out and the thing with the doublespeak is that
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:45.240]  they are trying to steal the 1984 mean that we've been saying for years wake up people it's 1984
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:49.800]  it's happening now they're actually turning that into a protest of donald trump to say that donald
[2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:56.680]  trump is the embodiment of orwell's exactly they say he's the fascist but i loved how uh
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:02.920]  he was on cnn and senator paul just a few days ago and they said yeah trumps trying to ban the
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:07.640]  press and he said he's trumps never called for that right trumps never there's no legislation
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:12.040]  you're the ones obama signed bills to begin to take over the countering disinformation and
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:17.320]  propaganda act right here and and and him lamenting for the good old days when there was just three
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:21.800]  media outlets that gave people the news it was much easier than and we've got to stop this and
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:26.120]  here's how it works if they can cut off our advertising our ability to go in the ad market
[2:45:26.120 --> 2:45:30.520]  okay if they can cut that off they're already kicking people on facebook and twitter they're
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:34.440]  going to be able to kick us off first it was my love first he was off twitter then his advertisers
[2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:38.040]  then they took something he said out of context years ago why didn't they care then because it was
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:42.760]  all about doing it now they're they're announcing now with the republican establishment the democrats
[2:45:42.760 --> 2:45:47.240]  we're going to censor people and so folks we're the canary in the coal mine understand that i
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.600]  personally on syndicated radio could sit here be in a bigger house with a private jet plane being on
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:46:00.200]  over 200 radio stations i take that money and i put it back 95 into things and built all this
[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:04.920]  because i'm the only talk show us that into jet airplanes and mansions okay so i do have a car
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:08.920]  but it's made in america that goes 200 miles an hour but it's not fancy and you know why i
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:12.680]  deserve that health care it was dangerous i got i'm bigger but anyways the point i'm getting in
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:17.800]  here is my highest thing on the hierarchy of needs is not being a peacock it's why i'm not in new
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:22.360]  york i'm not in la and trump talks about our enemies are in new york and la not the not the
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:27.000]  people but the elites that really have a spirit of wanting to dominate and control people i'm
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:31.480]  going to come back to you ladies and talk about this but listen folks you thank me all the time
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:37.480]  time we need to have people absolutely go crazy because you know we bring in a million dollars
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:43.080]  of sales yesterday and today but the discounts we have that might be 400 000 dollars we just
[2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:47.480]  lost probably five million dollars this year by them killing this we did 3.3 million to fund
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:52.040]  things last year it's one of our major initiatives to fund things they start blowing off our legs
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:46:56.600]  and they get successful it will make them come in i got a false suit or make them back off i
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:02.040]  mean i'm cornered here you understand i had to expand because i knew if you didn't expand in the
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:06.360]  face of what i was dealing with 10 years ago i'd be defeated we got big enough to get through their
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:11.720]  shockwave and really change the world and they know that that folks hundreds of publications a week
[2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:17.560]  say shut us up so understand we are your champion one way or the other and so if you just spread
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:21.960]  the articles the videos if you just save the articles start your own shows call in the c-span
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:27.240]  whatever you do get more active and more involved now we're going to lose it all jordan i promise
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:31.960]  to have you back up in the near future to do a special report just on your new film please send
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:37.880]  me a copy i got blindsided by this didn't know it was out looks amazing but just in a nutshell
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:42.680]  what can you say about free speech and why they're bringing in the islamicist and why they're trying
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:47.960]  to ban you know uh criticizing i mean that they have a bill they want to introduce to ban trump
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:53.480]  having free speech that was on cnn i mean this is they're so authoritarian what's happening
[2:47:55.880 --> 2:48:01.960]  first of all uh alex the the two charming young ladies brought up a very important point and that's
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:10.120]  exactly what's going on is that there is a uh a connection here between hillary um obama
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:18.040]  um and the old soviet uh empire the old soviet concepts and ideas because the people who finance
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:25.480]  the old soviet empire for the russians are the same people who are financing all of this stuff
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:30.520]  now against uh against well it's funny you said that because the documents are coming out that
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:34.280]  these globalists are funding russia and the united states it's the same corporates line
[2:48:34.280 --> 2:48:39.160]  and that's why they threatened in foreign affairs and in public policy publications last week to
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:43.800]  putin trumps for real about any globalism and you're part of it you better watch it that was a
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:54.200]  deep threat to putin yep as i said um i i've got something that i found a long time ago that the
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:49:00.360]  more i see it the more i cannot believe how overwhelmingly in tell us the name of the two
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:04.760]  two dvd film explain to us but give us one of the big secrets right now people will get it but just
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:13.320]  tell us i want to know well but the most important of the two videos is called cosmocrats because it
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:19.800]  goes back to the word in the greek in the bible where it says the rulers of this darkness rulers
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:27.480]  of darkness in the greek was cosmocraterus and i came across that word many years ago
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:35.720]  cosmocraterus which in greek means rulers of world darkness but uh it gives us outward today
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:42.360]  cosmocrats because the cosmos is world and crafts are rulers like democrats and plutocrats world
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:50.520]  rulers exactly so we got told in the bible that there are people who are here who are the gods
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:57.240]  of the darkness on the earth there are people here who are making it dark purposely and deceiving
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:02.760]  the human family and it has to be spiritual and physical if you notice nasa says the earth now
[2:50:02.760 --> 2:50:07.880]  30 percent darker because of the kim trails yeah but this this is what i'm talking about so
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:16.680]  the the video i wanted to create many years ago we talked about it i finally finally got it done
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:23.160]  it's not an mgm musical but it does have doesn't matter the involuntary the cover looks amazing
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:29.640]  show it to tv viewers again yeah it's it's got it's struggling i'll fly you out here to be in
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:33.880]  studio and do a whole special report with it anytime you want brother i mean as long as we
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:39.960]  have the funds who knows how long we'll be here now i'll tell you what you will be shocked when you
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:48.440]  see what i have a you know what i have a symbol here from hollywood from television from presidential
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:51.800]  yeah clearly they're programming us clearly clearly they're getting us ready but but i mean bottom
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:55.720]  line what's their in-game i mean i'm correct it's establish world government exterminate the
[2:50:55.720 --> 2:51:02.840]  population merge the machines yes basically it's a well-laid plan that was explained a long time
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:09.000]  ago there are documents that explain exactly how these people i didn't know your view of
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:13.880]  trump i didn't even know you'd seen his his inaugural speech but and then some of my private
[2:51:13.880 --> 2:51:17.720]  conversations it's all about the spirit of humanity bringing humanity back making the world
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:21.320]  for people he doesn't you know obviously you're talking to him he knows he's being recorded but
[2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:25.800]  he's like we're gonna be pro people we're gonna build a world for people you know you know robots
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:30.280]  aren't getting the jobs out like you know the whole thing's anti-human and trump gets it and i
[2:51:30.280 --> 2:51:34.600]  tweeted what he was going to say in his speech before he did it i just knew it and then he said
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:41.240]  we're calling god back in light back into the world a world for humans a world of justice but
[2:51:41.240 --> 2:51:47.480]  humans must ask for the destiny and god will give us the providence and that's asking for again
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:50.360]  what the elite are trying to block and again if you don't believe this is fine i'm gonna say
[2:51:50.360 --> 2:51:55.240]  i believe it totally i'd say what they believe we have to ask god's god's free will the devil
[2:51:55.240 --> 2:51:59.720]  and his fallen legions are not free will they con they take over they disease you they drug you
[2:51:59.720 --> 2:52:03.800]  they manipulate you they're the rulers of the world god of this world right now you gotta ask god in
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:09.320]  then you get the transmission the discernment all the will the download you need to beat them
[2:52:09.320 --> 2:52:13.880]  but you've got to ask for the download is that accurate jordan absolutely you have to and you
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:20.040]  also have to be active in this you have to be able to talk to people and show them the proof
[2:52:20.680 --> 2:52:28.280]  and that's what i've done here i've collected all the documents the photos the pictures and tied
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:33.800]  all the pieces together showing that what's happening in america and on the earth today
[2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:40.120]  has been planned a long time ago let me ask you a selfish question let me ask you a selfish question
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:48.360]  here personally you know chris carter contacted said hey and you know well we've talked some but
[2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:51.560]  we're going to put the new x files is based on you i think you're a good guy i think you're really
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:55.640]  fighting this evil they put it out it's overall pretty positive exposes the evil stuff that's
[2:52:55.640 --> 2:53:00.440]  going on but the elite are combined with a you know really nasty devil to try to take down humanity
[2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:03.720]  and then you know who knows the show was ahead who knows if it even gets to go to a season now
[2:53:03.720 --> 2:53:08.120]  they have homeland it's another big hit where they literally admit it's me but had me saying these
[2:53:08.120 --> 2:53:11.640]  things and then i caused horrible things to happen i need to be taken off the air that's
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:15.480]  basically and then hillary's the president and this was all being produced when when they thought
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:20.120]  she'd be president months ago so i want to selfishly just you're a smart guy ask you this is on
[2:53:20.120 --> 2:53:24.680]  drudgereport.com today as well what you make of this homeland's alex jones character is a lame
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:29.640]  attempt to smear info wars let's go ahead and play just one clip if they literally plagiarize
[2:53:29.640 --> 2:53:34.440]  what i say but in the episode i'm getting innocent muslims arrested for bombings that i'm basically
[2:53:34.440 --> 2:53:39.320]  behind so so so this is the deal they don't only take my words they know they call me fake news
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:44.360]  they have large productions acting like me but with but his name's ok if they have you going
[2:53:44.360 --> 2:53:48.520]  it's worse it's ok so it's alex jones talking about the names ok sorry go ahead yeah they're
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:53.880]  mixing together alex jones and james ok because they're just trying to demonize you guys they want
[2:53:53.880 --> 2:53:59.400]  the average brainless zombie that watches tv all day to think that all info wars listeners are
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:05.080]  terrorists mm-hmm and that we can't trust james okieff and his deceptive editing that's right so
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:08.840]  i mean but that's almost subliminal this is just okieff there but then it's me it's pretty clear
[2:54:08.840 --> 2:54:15.160]  so again this is how desperate they are here's the clip if you stop pushing back against them here
[2:54:15.160 --> 2:54:24.040]  every minute if you are that stupid what do you get boom that's what you get
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:33.800]  madame president elect i hope you're listening and if you are hear me now you brought this down on
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:43.560]  us you did and i can't take it anymore i won't take it anymore and i am not alone i am not alone
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:53.320]  if you want to fight and apparently you do if you want to fight you've got one from me in spades
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:55:00.200]  you've got the fight of your life and of course there's more to it than just that there's more
[2:55:00.200 --> 2:55:04.520]  to the club there's several other clubs but no alex notice he kind of looks like steven bannon
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:11.000]  me yes so they mix that in visually as well yes and now hold up now keith oberman stealing
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:15.880]  your thing so i mean they could turn this whole thing around and say it's him at this point he's
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:19.480]  there he's the resistance yeah we were always there that's the thing i mean george i'm not on
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:24.680]  a power trip it's the opposite you're an old sage at this what position do you think we're in because
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:29.000]  it's like the gates of hell of open i mean hundreds of articles a day lying about us false
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.640]  quotes megan kelly lying playing clips from about hillary funding islamist's killers in in syria
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:40.840]  they say i'm saying she's killing kids under a pizza place i mean what is going on well
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:46.520]  i'm not promoting myself on this alex but i'm telling you if you see my video where i have
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:51.640]  a symbol all of the people saying the same things from all over the world sure they're
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:57.000]  clearly part of a global cult who believes they're getting off-world information i mean i went back
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:01.480]  to huxley and wedgewood and gall to the guys that came with all the modern sciences in england
[2:56:01.480 --> 2:56:06.360]  they all believe they were channeling off-world info and here's the problem they saw the double
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:12.760]  helix they saw biometrics they saw it they saw it jordan is that what you're getting at yep
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:20.600]  absolutely but i'm just saying it's only until you yourself see and people collectively see for
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:27.400]  the first time how these symbols and words are used all over the world sure then they'll then
[2:56:27.400 --> 2:56:30.440]  they'll see it everywhere then they'll understand it all right jordan we'll talk to you soon i
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:33.640]  appreciate that you know jordan's an awesome guy he wanted to make that film with me and i said yeah
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:36.760]  sure never we never got around to it i don't know it's being a thing about the film today
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:41.960]  no but i mean because i mean i'm i'm here just explaining that whether you believe the elite
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:46.520]  believe they're doing all this off-world stuff or not they believe it and we're under major
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:52.440]  political attack they're trying to shut info wars down thank you thank you jordan that is the platform
[2:56:52.440 --> 2:56:57.880]  for so many other people so i mean what do you guys make of that well i mean this is something
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:04.680]  that i've always said and what i believed in why i was um you know dedicated my life to this
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:09.960]  purpose right here to waking people up and i truly believe it's not just about letting people realize
[2:57:09.960 --> 2:57:14.280]  that the programming and turning off a television set and helping people to understand it is the
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:18.920]  frequency that's messing with our brains messing with our humanity messing with our
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:23.880]  inner frequency everything they're doing is to hurt us yes but see it's not it's not that there's
[2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:29.320]  there is off-world uh information coming to these people to give them the technology of control
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:34.200]  and it is we are fighting against they're on a freaking plan in the middle of space
[2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:40.360]  exactly all believe it and they were giving stuff 170 years ago that they made right atomic weapon
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:45.400]  equations everything right like who are what is going on here well here's the thing we as human
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:50.920]  as human beings we are we're antennas we are manifestation machines that is what we do god
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:56.040]  created us to the image of god we are created and we're electrochemical our dna is an antenna
[2:57:56.040 --> 2:58:00.760]  and we're picking up good stuff and bad stuff as long as they can control our thoughts and program
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:07.240]  us and tell us what the world is supposed to look like and we will we will take that information
[2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:13.000]  and say yes i agree and exactly and notice and notice we're away right we know what's going on

[2:59:46.760 --> 2:59:58.760]  fusion take action now before we sell out you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:58.760 --> 3:00:01.800]  you
[3:00:09.640 --> 3:00:11.800]  another time
[3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:15.800]  in the age of wonder
[3:00:17.640 --> 3:00:19.800]  another world
[3:00:19.800 --> 3:00:26.840]  another time
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:35.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas broadcasting
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:42.840]  worldwide it's alex jones lean in was asking during the break can't i sue um the production
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:48.200]  company or showtime for stealing my identity taking my words and then having the person
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:52.200]  clearly meant to be me then have him do horrible things and set up innocent people and be a criminal
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:00:58.680]  i'm a public figure i'm a big boy they can they can probably get away with that
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:05.000]  but here's the difference google then in an organized deal with ad roll and other big companies
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:09.240]  can't go around and openly talk about how they want to shut down conservatives and libertarians
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:14.120]  and alt right which then means everybody ban us from advertising on the internet making up crap
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:19.000]  that we're violating laws or something and not showing what we've done okay this is a clear
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:23.560]  organized operation that's where it's wrong but i'll tell you this homeland has stolen my identity
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:30.600]  then they slapped oakie's name on it to get another enemy they've got and it's the idea of
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:35.880]  someone impassioned warning you about an islamic invasion when this morning i watched paul watch
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:39.240]  his video the truth about sweden last night and i went to you know i remember hearing about
[3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:43.240]  those rapes i never went and watched those on purposes i don't like that and i watched the
[3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:47.000]  real rape show those women gasping and fighting and panicking and crying and finally giving up
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:51.400]  all those Arabs are raping them and the police did nothing it's in stock home perfect stock
[3:01:51.400 --> 3:01:57.000]  home syndrome and it fundamentally made me sick i thought i got like heat flashes i never had
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:01.800]  ever been so pissed that i was actually getting heat flashes going to kick somebody's ass and
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:06.200]  it's not like i've been trying to impress women i'm the opposite of a rapist it fundamentally
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:11.400]  pisses me off so much to see that kind of crap and the type of elites that would bring these people
[3:02:11.400 --> 3:02:16.920]  in and then try to silence the women and try to say trump's wrong and these women are fighting for
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:21.880]  their lives like suffocating with like 10 guys on top of them begging and crying being raped
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:27.800]  and i have daughters it's fundamentally i'm just what what the hell's going on here yes and that's
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:33.400]  why they want to silence you because you dare speak out on that and and we have sorrows and other
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:38.040]  people funding groups so that they can control the french elections now because they can't allow
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:42.280]  what happened here in the united states as well as with brexit they can't allow those pillars
[3:02:42.280 --> 3:02:46.440]  of globalism to be dismantled worldwide exactly let me ask you this why would they want to bring
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:50.040]  in a bunch of people from collapsed third world countries or women were hoods that are sold on
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:54.840]  slave blocks and bring them in and let them rape and murder people what the hell's going on i don't
[3:02:54.840 --> 3:02:59.800]  i think it's even beyond order out of chaos i mean it's truly some it's darkness or it's a ritual
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:06.920]  yes it's it's trying to push forward the the end times and the left by even backing these these
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:12.040]  muslim refugees to come in here along with isis members they don't realize that when they're
[3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:16.600]  out there on the streets trying to you know seeing the call to prayer the muslim call to prayer they
[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:22.040]  don't actually realize that in their religion women are not allowed to sing the call to prayer
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:26.040]  well they would actually be beaten they're a one-half person blasphemy and again these are
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:30.840]  rock concerts held for the immigrants that are anti-racism girls and these women beautiful women
[3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:36.280]  go out and they literally get gang raped by these demon men i mean it's like i'm gonna be honest i
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:41.160]  want to just well i don't know if that that ain't going on in texas so people are not gonna be you
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:45.720]  know well they've got the rape bracelets now so that's supposed to stop the raping they give them
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:52.600]  the bracelets and they wear it and it says no i mean as a man this makes me have like a rage
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:57.480]  attack it's not a pick talk about triggered what is it like for women to watch this stuff yes i if
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:02.840]  i see those videos i truly get panic attacks i cry it just it like melts me down i mean as women
[3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:07.960]  you know we've probably had to deal with at least the slightest little bit of sexual harassment that
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:13.000]  you don't want uned you know what unwanted advances i've dealt with much more than that so it's like
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:18.440]  panic and yeah you get ringing in the ears nauseous stomach you know the best thing to do i have
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:23.160]  daughters i see these women held down flailing begging stop raping me and these assholes are

[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:32.120]  then and then and then like trump talks about it and they go the left all makes jokes and says

[3:08:39.640 --> 3:08:44.920]  made 3.3 million dollars with us last year now that's that's that's gross but you know we had
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:51.240]  products we were selling that helps find our operation you are fake news you are banned you

[3:08:56.120 --> 3:09:01.560]  you are conservative which i'm not i'm a libertarian patriot uh you're dehumanized we call you political
[3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:07.240]  we can't take political advertising which they actually do but they said we're not you know the
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:11.800]  proper political pact me promoting water filters and the second amendment and that's political
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:16.600]  don't know see they're calling everything under campaign laws political but with millie weaver
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:20.680]  and leon macadoo got really upset during the break i got upset because i saw paul talking about swedish
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:24.040]  rapes and how they were covering up in the news i thought you know i never went and watched any of
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:28.520]  those i saw people getting their facebook suspended for even talking about it let me go watch them
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:34.280]  at rock concerts that are anti-racism concerts and i watched like an 11 minute tape and we're not
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:39.320]  going to show the actual parts here but just her face for a second with like 10 muslim men from
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:44.840]  north africa these are mainly moroccan's uh that's out of the island raping her and she's begging
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:49.560]  and pleading for air and screaming stop stop and swedish and they are just raping the daylight
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:53.720]  sat over the police and the swedish men did nothing because they're liberal beta males
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:58.760]  and so they've had to cancel these concerts because they became rape fest and you'll see her
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:02.120]  face come up for air here in a minute she's begging we're not going to show again we're not
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:06.840]  showing the other parts this is all online and these guys tape this themselves look at her
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:12.360]  she's just begging and they are got her all held down and raping her and keeping people away
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:17.080]  this is the new liberal sacrament this is the new system so we have to talk about it even though
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:21.320]  it's uncomfortable i have daughters it's got to be exposed i hear about this western rape culture
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:24.920]  that's supposedly superliving when i know it's rare in the west compared to other countries
[3:10:24.920 --> 3:10:29.400]  islamic countries a woman not wearing a hood unattended is rape bait and if you and if you
[3:10:29.400 --> 3:10:35.880]  speak out and follow report you get the adultery charge and executed the men and lian's crying
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:41.080]  about this right now but we have to face this and deal with the torture of these women and why would
[3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:45.640]  the media say trump's lying when he was talking about the mass rapes that happened in the in the
[3:10:45.640 --> 3:10:51.160]  nights before they like lawyers they went didn't happen last night nothing happened but then the
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:56.280]  next night they burned part of sweden so so and they're burning paris they're burning everything
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:11:01.640]  right now well lian go ahead no i just it really truly gives me like i know it's hard to watch i
[3:11:01.640 --> 3:11:05.880]  can't watch it but we got to talk about it because they don't they want us just to submit to it so
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:10.600]  go ahead no it's it's terrible and that's the thing i just don't understand is how you can say
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:16.680]  you're for women and your for equality and then for whatever reason almost overnight they flip it
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:20.920]  around and now all of a sudden it's okay to rape little kids because that's their culture and it's
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:25.720]  okay to we'll we'll let you off easy because you were having a sexual emergency and that's why you
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:31.560]  had to rape a child or rape women you know because you're sexually frustrated what the hell is going
[3:11:31.560 --> 3:11:37.240]  on it's complete madness it makes no sense and well islamist so satanic in its current form
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:41.480]  that the new order loves it and is merged with it well you have these pedophile left likes islam
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:47.400]  idiot we have roger yet keep going okay he was on skype video i saw it went away no no i'm
[3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:51.640]  keep going i mean interrupt but it's just like you have idiot feminists like putting the the
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:56.120]  heat up on at least you have marie lapin the other day refuse and and walk out of the meeting
[3:11:56.120 --> 3:12:00.360]  because she refused to and she'd met with that imam before they told me that's real feminism
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:07.240]  yes and this is exactly about that exactly marie lapin marie lapin so she refused to put the head
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:13.480]  scarf on to just have a conversation with uh with this um imam or will i forget his name
[3:12:13.480 --> 3:12:19.800]  mufti mufti and she walked out she said no and the look on her face too was just like no it was
[3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:24.440]  like not like okay i'm sorry i'm gonna go now i apologize that's not my religion she said i refuse
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:28.680]  to cover myself she was like whatever i don't need this meeting with this person screw you
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:34.600]  and that is true feminism not backing down or knocking a peg out of your equality that is french
[3:12:34.600 --> 3:12:39.480]  women that are about to elect her we have fought hard for equality so you don't tell me oh well
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:44.200]  you know now you need to come bow down in front of me or put the head scarf on in order to just be
[3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:49.400]  in my presence she didn't tell him to go eat some bacon before she went to talk to her like
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:54.760]  you know okay you want to be equal here the liberal feminists are too deluded to realize
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:13:00.760]  what real oppressed women looks like and this video shows you exactly what an oppressed woman looks
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:05.960]  like the videos of the women in these muslim nations were being stoned to death and killed
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:10.360]  and murdered in the streets for no reason oh you didn't have a head scarf we're gonna kill you you
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:15.880]  dared to walk to the store without a male escort yeah we're gonna kill you if you don't have two
[3:13:15.880 --> 3:13:20.520]  or three male witnesses to your rape well then you're gonna be beheaded you're gonna be killed
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:27.960]  because we're gonna accuse you of being sexual without and did you see a new york thousands
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:33.560]  marching feminist rallies saying a la oct bar moment of prayer and and women leading prayers
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:38.760]  and they'll never show you the pictures of the women who are have been covered head to toe and
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:43.320]  acid that they've had thrown on them in these honor killings or watching them watching them
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:48.360]  rape that woman and the police it's Stockholm syndrome it's almost as though the the liberals
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:53.560]  are so fearful those such betas that they're trying to you know almost convince these muslims oh
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:58.120]  don't attack us we love you see we're tall and we're doing the call of prayer not knowing that
[3:13:58.120 --> 3:14:03.560]  actually having a woman do the call to prayer prayer is blasphemy and it would actually provoke
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:07.720]  them to my daughter's aren't wearing any of this crap so that's just the end of it i want you guys
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:11.240]  to ride shotgun he's got daughters room course he coming up at the bottom of the hour he didn't

[3:17:37.960 --> 3:17:41.880]  sponsors and i can't approve them i don't like it so that's a whole other issue but i love the
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.960]  network they're great folks but i added more hours i make 98% of the network's money so it doesn't
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:50.920]  even matter okay and i love telling everybody else the point is there won't be a show soon if they
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:57.080]  get away with this obama signed a law two weeks before trump got into residency saying the cia
[3:17:57.080 --> 3:18:02.120]  will take over the media and we'll use regulations and the federal elections commission and the fcc
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:07.080]  to shut down everybody and they've named me and they've named drudge and they've taken the sponsors
[3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:12.360]  from right barred and they've kicked right barred's apps off the freaking you know itunes store
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:19.400]  there you pay for it they approve it and then they say your speech is evil we ban it outside of a

[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:31.560]  show you what a real feminist looks like someone who is for real equality and fairness so
[3:19:32.120 --> 3:19:36.360]  and not afraid to be feminine the feminist is supposed to be ugly and not throw around that
[3:19:36.360 --> 3:19:40.680]  goddess power that's why they ban wonder woman they said she's too feminine too feminine they
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:45.080]  should really be called masculinists because there's nothing really feminine about today's
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:50.200]  modern day give me wonder woman the whole world's waiting for you and the power you possess sorry
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:53.960]  go ahead and roger tip your camera down a little bit we want to see that sharp suit that's that's
[3:19:53.960 --> 3:19:59.240]  more than a pinstripe is that like little pin dot suit what do you call that this suit is uh
[3:19:59.240 --> 3:20:06.200]  probably older than your oldest child alex it is uh was made by uh a legendary italian
[3:20:06.200 --> 3:20:14.360]  uh uh taylor on fifth avenue i like it uh his name was uh nino spano uh and he had kind of a
[3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:22.280]  neapolitan shoulder but a uh a fullness through the chest and back of a softer uh uh anderson
[3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:30.040]  and shepherd type london model so it was kind of british tailing with an italian flair i like it
[3:20:30.040 --> 3:20:35.080]  that may be your best suit i'll tell you but seriously i'm ranting and raving i'm so pissed off
[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:38.680]  that i mean i had to leave yesterday i mean i'm this is i'm genuinely pissed i shouldn't have these
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:43.480]  but i mean i just got robbed for five million this year it was three point three we made last
[3:20:43.480 --> 3:20:47.320]  year it was five million we'd make this year to fight the globalist this is a major freaking blow
[3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:56.760]  man i'm pissed well look alex i myself uh learned uh yesterday that the fissa court approved a
[3:20:56.760 --> 3:21:01.960]  surveillance of yours truly over a year ago that means oh yeah i'm sorry they sent me an email of
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:08.680]  huge breaking news i apologize let's break this down right now start over this is huge breaking news
[3:21:08.680 --> 3:21:14.680]  of roger stone that the i guess it's called the fissa court uh or the fissa court uh approved
[3:21:14.680 --> 3:21:21.720]  government surveillance of yours truly over a year ago i'd like to know on the basis of what
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:28.360]  evidence in other words uh hillary clinton press release uh a clipping in the newspaper uh so my
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:36.200]  so my uh civil rights have been uh my civil rights my civil liberties have been violated by this
[3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:43.240]  intrusion into my privacy may they may have learned many many things but i'll tell you what
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:52.520]  they didn't find collusion or connections or contacts with any russians the fact that the warrant
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:21:59.160]  has leaked from the court is a crime itself so now they're leaking it to destroy the good character
[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:09.720]  of roger stone and paul maniforte uh and this poor chap carter page who is unknown to me uh and uh it
[3:22:09.720 --> 3:22:17.000]  is uh the mugging here is extraordinary meanwhile meanwhile i was talking to former congressman
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:22.360]  head of the you know major committees homeland security by said of the armed services saying oh
[3:22:22.360 --> 3:22:26.440]  it's hillary's a chinese and russian spy it's already come out but i'm gonna expose it the next
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:31.160]  few days but dr gerome course he was coming up i mean this is just bombshell it's well known
[3:22:31.160 --> 3:22:35.160]  that they're russian and communist chinese agents then they got the nerve to claim this with you
[3:22:35.160 --> 3:22:40.360]  you get poisoned with polonium and then they never show the proof they always just say oh well we know
[3:22:40.360 --> 3:22:44.440]  they were in contact but i've talked to you and everybody this is horsemaner well in fact dr
[3:22:44.440 --> 3:22:51.960]  course he has done incredible investigative work tying john podesta and hillary clinton uh and john's
[3:22:51.960 --> 3:22:58.440]  brother tony uh to uh incredible dealings with the ruling clique and the power brokers around
[3:22:58.440 --> 3:23:05.400]  putin the uranium deal which was a tony podesta deal is i think well known thanks sure and they
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:10.440]  never would have released your times piece on it sure and they would have released this stuff on you
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:15.240]  if they had something keep recycling now four times the last four months every month the same
[3:23:15.240 --> 3:23:19.640]  thing we've got him he's with the russians and you're literally here just laughing at him i mean
[3:23:19.640 --> 3:23:22.920]  no one ever accused you of this before there's no evidence they would have used it if they had it
[3:23:22.920 --> 3:23:30.040]  they just keep recycling it right well and let's just review it in this story of january 20th a
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:36.840]  morning of donald trump's inauguration a story that i am convinced was placed for the purpose of
[3:23:36.840 --> 3:23:43.960]  aggravating him kicking him in the shins uh alleged that there were email transmissions
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:52.200]  and financial transactions that the 17 intelligence agencies they love to use that one over and over
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:24:01.480]  again all obama appointees all neocons all part of the rogue operation that is the central
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:11.160]  intelligence agency uh had uh had this uh had this information where is it where can we yeah you
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:14.440]  want to go before congress and they said they were going to call you but you get hit with polonium
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:19.080]  then that's all confirmed they don't even want to cover listen it's not in the news
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:24.840]  that adro and google banned me you think that's their big victory but they know it's so so so
[3:24:24.840 --> 3:24:29.320]  oppressive that they don't want their censorship campaign to be known they just want to call for
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:34.200]  it and have it happen quietly the problem is we're not going quietly into the night so where do
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:39.800]  you expect all this to go well alex let me put it to you another way every phone conversation that
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:45.320]  you and i have had over the last year uh and there have been many i'm happy to say but i told you
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:50.600]  if they all i told you they were always recording as as monitored but that but the brazen nature of
[3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:57.320]  this is outrageous uh roger i've had them pop on and threaten me and my family before believe me
[3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:01.960]  and tell me where i was five minutes before it's all part of the scythe man hey you're you're now
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:09.960]  really arrived now man well uh i it's a list i'd prefer not to be on but of course the point here
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:19.080]  is that i know that donald trump and roger stone and paul manifold and i've read mr carter's
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:28.040]  quickie book in his denials uh i have nothing to fear from a real unbiased fair investigation
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:35.080]  that lets everyone speak any charge against me would have to be a fabrication i expect none
[3:25:35.640 --> 3:25:41.320]  i'm consulting as you are with your attorneys with mine to see what i mean this is
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:49.160]  discord destroying my good character through the leak of the existence of this uh uh let's just say
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:54.680]  it let's just say it of the hey it's all suit time my friend well i look i am and i am privately
[3:25:54.680 --> 3:26:02.920]  consulting a very uh a very uh respected and esteemed uh former judge whose name i can't reveal
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:10.360]  andrew depolitano uh as to what my legal options may be well listen i've had them say in the news
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:14.280]  i'm a russian agent i mean the only russian connection i have is daria's u.s army veteran
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:19.640]  great patriot she's russian but i mean my family fought the russians in covert stuff i know i don't
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:25.000]  know the details is all classified but uh i mean this is the craziest crap i've ever heard trump's
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:29.960]  trying to make our country great bring back our sovereignty stop the globalist and and they just
[3:26:29.960 --> 3:26:35.240]  keep pushing this narrative because it's their excuse to keep commanding brigades within the deep
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:39.720]  state which even limbaugh admits is now doing this now to take action i think they're losing
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:44.200]  though when limbaugh is exposing rogue elements of the cia but i've got to tell you i'm not a guy
[3:26:44.200 --> 3:26:48.600]  that wants marshal law and some kind of civil war we're already in one and i think the president
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:54.040]  should go out prepare the ground uh for mass arrest of the people that are trying to kill him
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:57.640]  trying to overthrow the country trying to sell us out i think it's time the president
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:27:01.960]  take the gloves off he tried to fix the economy he's trying to move forward and be a good guy
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:06.280]  they're opening the newspaper saying kill him he's got to do basically what linca did and it's time
[3:27:06.280 --> 3:27:10.040]  to crack eggs i think the president it's time the president take the gloves off and be abraham
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:17.480]  lincoln big time so alex i think he's on his way to do that this upcoming speech is very important
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:26.520]  i think he is finding his sea legs the treachery of the mainstream media is beyond what even he
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:33.960]  could have foreseen the vituperation the smears the lies the the oh he gave the speech he went
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:39.320]  he went everybody else can have cold but us and it's totally clean why is that hurt anybody just
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:44.840]  let us have a country he just is so good he doesn't get we're supposed to be screwed so this is a
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:52.600]  russian agent we need more of this yes absolutely i look i think that um you know his leadership
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:28:01.400]  qualities are beginning to uh to come uh you know to the core uh i think he is lonely uh you know he
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:08.360]  is uh he is uh working very hard longer hours than he put in at his desk at the trump organization
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:15.000]  even after he retires to the family quarters he is working the phones like linden johnson
[3:28:16.200 --> 3:28:23.080]  ceo's he's trying to coax into expanding here political friends friends from uh i agree it's
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:28.120]  like watching a lion fight a thousand wild dogs and hyena when you i'm not trying to lionizing
[3:28:28.120 --> 3:28:34.280]  it he's a lion i am lionizing him it's literally epic because i'm in a lower level experiencing
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:39.320]  the same thing so is roger and it's like you could join them and screw everybody over and they
[3:28:39.320 --> 3:28:42.840]  leave you alone but i don't want to be in the company of these people i don't want to join with
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:47.800]  evil and screw america over i can't do it they call me a chump then they say i'm a traitor and
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:52.840]  by the way roger i forgot they've banned you i was reading off ad role as well there is a major

[3:29:21.320 --> 3:29:26.120]  he was aggressive as is fair it was a fair balanced interview and i appreciated being

[3:34:14.040 --> 3:34:17.800]  something in the media we're all being listened to i've been sitting there with get people before
[3:34:17.800 --> 3:34:22.120]  the cia calls them up on the phone and says watch what you're saying because the guy i'm talking to
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:28.840]  is you know cia and i don't mean cia analyst i mean cia daisy you know pushing machine and you
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:34.120]  know that's the real world we live in here i don't say all that to act informative or even impressive
[3:34:34.120 --> 3:34:40.280]  it's just is a fact it is information and i'm just to go to american that wants to cut taxes and
[3:34:40.280 --> 3:34:45.240]  have federal reserve loans to small businesses and and to have sovereignty and be strong again
[3:34:45.240 --> 3:34:49.160]  you've got a bunch of people that have chips on their shoulders that want to just sell us out
[3:34:49.160 --> 3:34:54.120]  to any foreign interests that have run the country in the ground maxine waters thinks that again russia
[3:34:54.680 --> 3:35:00.360]  attacked north korea or south korea last week she thinks bush is still in office i mean i mean i
[3:35:00.360 --> 3:35:03.800]  used to hear pechenik and stuff like 15 years ago they're a bunch of incompetence i'm like oh no
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:09.960]  they're like masterminds no it's worse yeah we have her saying and trump's entire cabinet
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:14.680]  her quote scumbags cue that up in a minute yeah i've got to go i'm just you're saying i want to
[3:35:14.680 --> 3:35:17.960]  hear from pechenik and i want to get into all this other stuff the campaign for censorship
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:23.880]  trump's upcoming speech wrench previs uh latest moves he's got a lot of big data he was telling
[3:35:23.880 --> 3:35:27.800]  me before we got on air and he hadn't even got to it yet so hope pechenik can kind of laser beam in
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:33.000]  here quick as well uh the phisa court authorized surveillance of key communications of him a year
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:38.600]  ago how did you learn that and then i want to ask pechenik before i leave ladies popping anytime
[3:35:38.600 --> 3:35:42.760]  this is a roundtable discussion how'd you learn uh that you're being spied on by the national
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:48.920]  security agency uh it was reported several places in the mainstream media andy mccarthy uh spoke of
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:54.520]  it uh uh openly in public which was widely covered yes so that's illegal to even talk about it okay
[3:35:54.520 --> 3:36:00.120]  so right so i went immediately to judge napolitano who was horrified just the fact that they
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:06.760]  got an authorization and that there were three individuals and it was confirmed uh that i was
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:14.520]  one of them uh you know it's it's an obviously they see me as an enemy of the deep state uh they know
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:21.960]  of my great uh support and uh and affection and relationship with the president uh they're getting
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:27.560]  rid of everybody that's americana that they know gives trump comfort that's why they're blocking
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:31.800]  all those comments that are positive to him it's why they don't want him answering the phones
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:35.400]  it's why he sits there at night answering the switchboard the big secret nobody wants you to know
[3:36:35.400 --> 3:36:39.480]  because he really does care they call that a weakness but he really likes average people
[3:36:39.480 --> 3:36:43.960]  because he's a blue-collar billionaire like his dad was and i think we've said that they're trying to
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:47.240]  cut him off i want to bring up dr pacenic and then i got to go then you guys all have a free
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:51.640]  for all but let the ladies get into doc what do i do you used to run black cops been involved in all
[3:36:51.640 --> 3:36:57.320]  sorts of regime changes i know you're confident we're beating them but right now they are blowing
[3:36:57.320 --> 3:37:03.480]  the living hell out of my my operation financially i've talked to lawyers they say we've got serious
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:08.120]  lawsuits but i don't love lawsuits but i guess i've got to do it dr pacenic i mean what do you
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:14.040]  make of all this this is just outrageous how he's a russian spy they're spying on him uh all this
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:20.440]  is going on and now google won't take our ads it's happened to stone stone didn't get to that yet
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:24.920]  i mean they've called for this purge the president needs to come out and say you back off google and
[3:37:24.920 --> 3:37:29.560]  others or we're going to slap you with any trust google's already had a trust under obama i am sick
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:34.440]  of these people like zuckerberg and schmidt believing i don't have free speech trying to ruin
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:39.400]  you know america and have one sided deals but look at tpp was meant to screw over the average
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:43.880]  american business person uh so dr pacenic quit comment on that and i want to let you guys take
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:50.200]  over for the most part uh you have been the voice roger's the voice but in many ways this is a
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:55.000]  reflection of what happened during the nixon administration where everybody called him crazy
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:02.040]  or anti-semitic none of which was true when google plays with you and and decides to interfere with
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:09.400]  your business that is major impediment of commerce google knows that that's going to stop the hidden
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:14.440]  government remember what i said a long time ago we have a division within the so-called hidden
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:20.840]  government i can assure you that roger stone alex jones is seen very favorably by those who i work
[3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:28.200]  with doesn't mean i'm being surveyed and i've been you know monitored since i said yes because there's
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:33.560]  no problem when i'm being monitored and i feel comfortable with the people whom i deal with
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:40.440]  now for 30 years uh both the cia military intelligence has been concerned about our country
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:46.920]  now what we have is a backlash from those in the cia and elsewhere who feel that they've been taken
[3:38:46.920 --> 3:38:53.080]  advantage of they've been co-opted and correctly we counted good with people who were loyal to you
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:59.400]  alex loyal to roger stone and understood both the nixon and reagan administration so what you're
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:05.640]  seeing now within the deep-seated community or the so-called secret government is an internal fight
[3:39:05.640 --> 3:39:10.520]  that i've been telling you about for 15 to 20 years but it's come out to the forefront and you
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:15.640]  predicted so i'm asking you i know it's top people and and obama left behinds that are doing it they're
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:20.440]  in open rebellion uh tillers is trying to clear them out i know we've got good people that's why
[3:39:20.440 --> 3:39:25.640]  maxine waters is so pissed calling them scum bags because they know they're starting to lose i'm just
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:29.480]  telling you i'm the president just for himself and everybody else they're waging war against his
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:34.920]  kids his businesses i'm not looking for authoritarianism but we're getting attacked it's time to punch
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:40.040]  back against these assholes i'm sorry i'm gonna let you guys take over but don't commit irony alex if
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:47.000]  you go to the aclu and i think this is exactly what you should do and ask the aclu to protect you
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:53.720]  these are the google and amazon and anybody on the internet and then file a suit for violation of the
[3:39:53.720 --> 3:39:59.800]  first amendment second amendment any amendment and the impediment to do business let's see what
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:05.240]  happens in other words let's not get upset about the left let's use it aclu should be
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:10.760]  prepared to defend you and anyone else on the political sure i agree and we're gonna do that
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:15.160]  but let me ask you this it seems like a super bold move from talking to your big sources i've got
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:19.960]  some high levels as well i mean i think we're winning right now restoring the republic but
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:23.960]  i mean how serious is the civil war in the deep state where's it going i'm gonna turn this over
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:29.960]  to roger stone uh and of course uh mac adieu and uh the other crew members go ahead roger is aware
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.880]  of something like this because it happened within nixon let from my perspective roger knew nixon far
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:43.160]  better than i but i knew one thing when he when nixon was attacked by the wall by a washington post
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:49.480]  by the so-called uh uh bernstein and woodward team what was not brought out to the forefront and i
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:55.720]  had to bring it out subsequently and i said at the eagles bird at the time was woodward was not
[3:40:55.720 --> 3:41:03.000]  just simply a reporter he had been part of naval intelligence and the person he briefed in the nixon
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:08.920]  administration and who briefed him in return was a man called alexander hay or colonel hay at the
[3:41:08.920 --> 3:41:15.000]  time so what you had even at that point in time in the sixties and seventies is that nixon was
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:22.040]  pinpointed by intelligence the cia was not a friend of nixon's nixon knew that very well nixon had
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:28.360]  very much of the same traits that trump did self-made man a man who did not trust the establishment
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:33.480]  did not like the yearlies did not like the harvests the princestants and all that nonsense
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:38.440]  but he was at the mercy of henry kissinger and others who went to harvard and yeah
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:44.200]  he was calling anti-semite if it wasn't for nixon the state of israel wouldn't be here today
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:51.480]  roger knows this better than i do that literally nixon gave uh gold in my ear all the planes she
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:58.200]  needed in the sixth day war literally our pilots flew into l televiv the idf took it over and they
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:04.440]  just went on to win the war so what we have now is a recapitulation of what we had in the nixon
[3:42:04.440 --> 3:42:10.360]  administration a little bit of what we had in the reagan administration but this is very much what a
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:16.040]  revolution looks like in the 21st century you happen to be the person that they can pick off
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:21.960]  most readily because you're in the press they can mock you they can laugh you but the old saying goes
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:26.760]  don't forget my name and you can knock me in as many times as you want because your brand will
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:32.600]  continue to go up when i read that article in the new york times that you had five to ten to
[3:42:32.600 --> 3:42:38.360]  eighteen million listeners worldwide i would like to see the compilation of all the newspapers
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:44.440]  and see what their subscription is it doesn't come one tenth to your subscription rate so
[3:42:44.440 --> 3:42:49.320]  then you will have support you will not only have support from people like myself you have
[3:42:49.320 --> 3:42:55.240]  support within the so-called deep government so does roger the reason for that is the deep
[3:42:55.240 --> 3:43:01.160]  government need is an access point in order to get to the right in order to go to the center
[3:43:01.160 --> 3:43:06.440]  this was not something i made up this was not something nixon made up it was an old strategy
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:11.080]  that we would come in from the right in order to get to the middle roger knew about it nixon knew
[3:43:11.080 --> 3:43:18.120]  about it and it went on and on and kissinger knew about it so what we have right now is an internal
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:24.440]  fight going on what maxine water says is not relevant nancy polosi is not relevant most of
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:30.760]  the people you hear on the radio and television coming from congress are totally irrelevant
[3:43:30.760 --> 3:43:37.320]  it's the ones you don't hear from the ones who are quiet and silent and basically control the
[3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:43.320]  purse strings those are the ones that trump has the closest relationship to because you have to
[3:43:43.320 --> 3:43:50.840]  remember that mcconnell's wife madame chow is a part of the administration you also have to
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:57.240]  remember that we have now free military officers who will contain and constrain the administration
[3:43:57.240 --> 3:44:03.240]  in such a way that there will be no attempt for a counter coup that's why the civilian intelligence
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:09.720]  and the cia and elsewhere is very frightened this is the first time we have had military officers
[3:44:09.720 --> 3:44:15.000]  distinguished military officers who have come to the forefront and said you know what i'm serving
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:19.480]  the administration not to get one more grade because they're all generals it's not to get
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:24.360]  more money because they don't need it but to save the republic and to make sure that we do not go
[3:44:24.360 --> 3:44:32.760]  to unnecessary wars and we no longer deplete our money source into irrelevant activities like war
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:38.120]  and other overseas activities that obama did right now fortunately we're bringing back four
[3:44:38.120 --> 3:44:44.440]  thousand of our troops in a national guard from jibouti did anyone in the obama administration
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:50.840]  say to anyone in the united states that we have soldiers in africa fighting in sumalia sudan
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:58.280]  ethiopian elsewhere no what happened was that obama as always he kept it quiet he was cryptic
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:03.560]  and devious yet no one has picked it up from the new york times because they were afraid to talk about
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:09.080]  those kind of episodes no one talked about the fact that we went into libya without any preparation
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:15.880]  it was the cia panetta and a whole group of others and our own soldiers did not approve of that the
[3:45:15.880 --> 3:45:24.600]  issue was that we had an offline situation in libya the ambassador had other issues in hand
[3:45:24.600 --> 3:45:31.480]  and unfortunately the episode occurred but that was steve i'm sorry steve let me uh let me uh
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:37.720]  jump in here if i may first of all uh you are absolutely right uh about what happened under
[3:45:37.720 --> 3:45:44.200]  the agency uh because of course i was there you and i have compared notes we come away with the
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:50.040]  same impression this is a very key point i recommend a book called silent coup by Leonard
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:56.760]  collodney now out again uh publicly which reveals that bob woodward has a long relationship with
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:46:04.680]  naval intelligence it is actually bill sullivan uh who uh who is uh talking to him through uh
[3:46:04.680 --> 3:46:11.000]  through uh the entire watergate affair and how he has suppressed this i have a monograph coming
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:17.960]  out shortly five thousand words entitled the many lies of robert woodward or bob woodward pardon me
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:25.880]  which you'll be able to get uh online um it is extraordinary uh that the uh that the division
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:32.600]  that steve describes in the agency is absolutely true here are the problems though those who support
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:40.440]  liberty and freedom and the alex jones roger stone libertarian right agenda of freedom and civil
[3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:47.880]  liberties uh are the grunts the agents the people at the middle and lower levels the leadership
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:57.560]  is still an obama appointed clique of elitists ivy leaguer's one-worlders globalists in the case of
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:06.280]  former director brennan an active communist uh in the uh u.s. communist party politics of gust hall
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:15.000]  so uh at a man with an obvious weakness for um radical islam uh and ahabism
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:21.320]  um so that's where the leaking is happening that is where the plan to take out donald trump
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:30.040]  is being executed uh and the president has to be aware of of how deep the hatred goes they are
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:39.400]  leaking on general flinn they are leaking about the fissa court uh warren against yours truly
[3:47:39.400 --> 3:47:46.600]  to uh monitor steve every conversation you and i have had little men in the trailers have their
[3:47:47.160 --> 3:47:53.320]  their uh their headphones going it's like the it's like a movie it's so ridiculous i'm sure it is
[3:47:53.320 --> 3:47:59.640]  somewhat more sophisticated these days yeah well this is incredibly i feel like i this is incredible

[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:08.840]  when we come out back from the break i mean millie and i are kind of sitting here and just sort of
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:15.960]  young in the game to us this is unprecedented watching the media and everyone calling our president
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:21.800]  hitler and the movie theaters around the country are going to be showing 1984 to protest the president
[3:48:21.800 --> 3:48:28.280]  as if that's not the ultimate double speak that we were warned about in 1984 and we're kind of
[3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:33.960]  wondering are they gonna succeed will they succeed in this coup and taking out the president i mean
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:41.400]  they are full steam ahead all cylinders firing trying to convince the nation that he is the
[3:48:41.400 --> 3:48:48.040]  ultimate embodiment of hitler hitler reborn and we just want to know what is he going to be successful
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:53.400]  i want to remind everyone why we are here why we've got roger stone here and and steve pochetic

[3:50:37.880 --> 3:50:42.040]  we're getting right now from roger stone and steve penic i just want to know do you guys
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:45.080]  what can you tell those of us out here this is sort of the first time we're really
[3:50:45.080 --> 3:50:49.800]  excited about politics activated and loving what's going on in this country and now we're just shocked
[3:50:49.800 --> 3:50:55.400]  to see people like bill crystal or come out and say you know we believe in democracy but i'd rather
[3:50:55.400 --> 3:51:01.560]  have a deep state than a president trump i i know bill crystal bill crystal is one of those
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:07.320]  jewish neocons who is basically what we call a chicken hawk a chicken hawk if somebody can
[3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:13.960]  espouse all kinds of wars but hasn't personally made sure he never went into the draft he is
[3:51:13.960 --> 3:51:20.680]  such a draft dodger along with all the other neocons pearl wilful with salma and alizade hadley
[3:51:20.680 --> 3:51:27.880]  that they have already been denigrated in terms of our part of the deep republic crystal has no
[3:51:27.880 --> 3:51:35.080]  idea what he's talking about he's just a mouthpiece for obama let me jump in here if i may because i
[3:51:35.080 --> 3:51:40.760]  have a very friendly relationship with bill he's actually a very pleasant chap now he voted for
[3:51:40.760 --> 3:51:48.360]  ubert humphrey uh he he comes from a long line of liberal democrats uh he he seems to share the same
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:56.520]  foreign policy view of john mccain and uh his mini me sidekick sidekick lindsay graham which is
[3:51:56.520 --> 3:52:05.960]  send troops first ask questions later uh but uh that said uh we're in a very dangerous uh time
[3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:13.080]  here because you have this rogue element they know that if the president cleans house at the agency
[3:52:13.080 --> 3:52:19.080]  which is what they fear uh and uh at this juncture they're well aware that the only person in the
[3:52:19.080 --> 3:52:25.400]  building loyal to the chain of command of the president is the director no one has been hired
[3:52:25.400 --> 3:52:32.680]  below him yet these people are all obama holdovers leaking like a sieve and much much information
[3:52:32.680 --> 3:52:39.320]  is not filtering down to the second and third level agents and men and women who work conscientiously
[3:52:39.320 --> 3:52:45.800]  to protect their country the same thing is true of the fbi the leadership is heavily politicized
[3:52:45.800 --> 3:52:51.400]  and has their own agenda the rank and file agents the men and women protecting us our
[3:52:51.400 --> 3:52:58.200]  patriotic americans and they don't know everything i agree with you but here's one of the issues that
[3:52:58.200 --> 3:53:05.560]  is far more important than i've seen over the years and so is the military the cia has recruited
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:12.280]  about 60 to 70 percent of the internal staff has been outsourced either through buzalin
[3:53:12.840 --> 3:53:18.840]  and you can see this with edward snowden snowden ostensibly came out of special forces he broke
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:24.520]  his leg or whatever the nonsense story was he came into the cia were recruited by the cia then
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:31.560]  left the cia but came back as a contract player the reason they do this in the cia why the cia is
[3:53:31.560 --> 3:53:37.960]  bloated highly expensive and it's not completely loyal to the united states it's very simple they
[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:43.960]  do not work directly for the cia of the united states government they usually work for an outsourcing
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:50.760]  contractor for the most part buzalin l3 or any one of the other blackwater associations the
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:56.920]  military works specifically for the military we have no outsourcing going on other than those
[3:53:56.920 --> 3:54:03.400]  that are given to civilians or people who want to protect the state department when trump came in
[3:54:03.400 --> 3:54:09.400]  there was a very clear message we will decrease the size of the cia we will decrease the size of
[3:54:09.400 --> 3:54:15.800]  the state department and we will not spare anyone i i understand what you're saying about bill
[3:54:15.800 --> 3:54:21.640]  crystal i've never had that attitude toward him i find him quite despicable as i do most of the
[3:54:21.640 --> 3:54:28.280]  neocon i just i find his politics despicable well i find as an american citizen who was basically
[3:54:28.280 --> 3:54:33.000]  called a lazy american and that shouldn't we be happy to be replaced with the new illegal
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:37.160]  immigrants coming in the country i find that remarked by him despicable and to just put it
[3:54:37.160 --> 3:54:42.760]  out there that that's the plan of the globalist to replace all of us lazy americans and people who
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:47.560]  actually want to fight for this country and believe in liberty and freedom and and actually
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:53.320]  give a crap about the constitution let me tell you one thing the notion of globalism is dying on
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:54:59.400]  the vine i said it years ago and i'm saying it again brexit came out of the trump movement
[3:54:59.400 --> 3:55:06.920]  another major movement that initiated the european union was france and what is happening to france
[3:55:06.920 --> 3:55:12.680]  they've been occupied by muslims the immigration issue is so grand that madame leban from the
[3:55:12.680 --> 3:55:20.040]  extreme right will probably be the next president of france she will then initiate article 50 to
[3:55:20.040 --> 3:55:26.760]  withdraw from the eu once france withdraws from the eu germany will then have to deal with greece
[3:55:26.760 --> 3:55:33.960]  idly spain and you've got a basket case so in fact what's happened is globalism is dying on the vine
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:39.320]  don't give them more credit than they need they're falling apart that's why putin can come in and
[3:55:39.320 --> 3:55:44.840]  try to help them out but putin is in financial trouble china is in financial trouble the only
[3:55:44.840 --> 3:55:52.040]  country which is not in financial trouble is the united states we have now gone to the imf thanks to
[3:55:52.040 --> 3:55:57.800]  manutian and basically said to leban and to the director of the imf and the world bank
[3:55:57.800 --> 3:56:04.360]  realign your currency rates so that the dollar reflects correctly how we can do trade and don't
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:10.680]  artificially pump us up so that we cannot do trade so trump is working in many many different
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:16.360]  levels unfortunately that's not brought out and most people in the new york times have no idea
[3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:21.480]  of what we're talking about that's why alex jones that's why roger that's why you ladies are
[3:56:21.480 --> 3:56:27.480]  extremely important to what's happening this is a revolution right and what you just said about
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:31.400]  france is really key because we've reported about how george soros and these other groups
[3:56:31.400 --> 3:56:39.160]  are actually now working with uh internet giants to be able to stop what happened here in the united
[3:56:39.160 --> 3:56:44.600]  states with the unprecedented election with of donald trump they want to stop that from happening
[3:56:44.600 --> 3:56:51.960]  in france so they're already trying to uh stop access to information and info wars is the place
[3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:56.360]  where people french citizens can come here and get accurate information about what's going on in
[3:56:56.360 --> 3:57:01.880]  their country or swedish citizens of course because it's uh they're silenced in their own country
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:06.360]  exactly and you know i have a question for you guys because we've seen how you know the mainstream
[3:57:06.360 --> 3:57:11.240]  media has done a really good job of getting everybody so caught up on these other issues and
[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:16.520]  and the whole trump having to defend himself over these russian allegations yet you know we kind of
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:22.440]  have lost lost track of going after hillary and really putting her behind bars if anybody should
[3:57:22.440 --> 3:57:27.640]  be being you know investigated or a judge allowing them to spy on it would be hillary clinton not
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:34.760]  somebody like roger stone right who hasn't really done anything to warrant that type of a an invasion
[3:57:34.760 --> 3:57:42.120]  on their privacy but this is my question what do you guys think about um the potential coup
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:47.240]  that we could be seeing on you know donald trump at this time and and what do you think about you
[3:57:47.240 --> 3:57:54.040]  know flinn and the timeliness of his resignation juxtaposed with now info wars being attacked and
[3:57:54.040 --> 3:58:00.360]  milo unopolis being you know having to be kind of resigned from breitbart what do you think about
[3:58:00.360 --> 3:58:05.720]  all of this happening all at once and and what kind of vulnerability does that uh does that
[3:58:05.720 --> 3:58:10.280]  is like what an excellent question i can't believe you just asked that oh millie weaver with the
[3:58:10.280 --> 3:58:14.280]  just the one two punch there we actually are about to go to break here in about 30 seconds i
[3:58:14.280 --> 3:58:19.480]  know paul joseph watson is going to be uh joining us on the flip side i'm not sure if you guys can
[3:58:19.480 --> 3:58:24.600]  stick around to answer that question or if we'll have paul right away um but anyone else who if you
