[00:00.000 --> 00:27.120]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show this Sunday, June 28th, 2015, I'm David Knight, I'll be
[00:27.120 --> 00:32.760]  your host today. Amazing week for news this week. We've seen a lot of moves
[00:32.760 --> 00:37.120]  towards world government towards abandoning the rule of law first by
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.560]  the Congress then by the Supreme Court just making things up out of thin air
[00:40.560 --> 00:46.320]  and I'm talking about both Supreme Court decisions this week. We also have what
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.120]  looks like a repeat of last week but this may be the real thing happening in
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.960]  Greece this week. We have a the financial situation there may be coming to a peak
[00:56.960 --> 01:01.000]  this week. There's a major payment that needs to be made on Tuesday and of course
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.480]  the Greek Prime Minister has gotten a pass that they're going to have a
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.120]  referendum on whether or not they should accept this deal which is
[01:11.120 --> 01:14.240]  essentially going to be a referendum of whether or not they should leave the EU.
[01:14.240 --> 01:22.420]  The Troika, the IMF, the European Central Bank have come in and offered made what
[01:22.420 --> 01:26.360]  they said is their last and final offer so basically if this is a poker game
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.720]  they're kind of going to set on their the hand that they have dealt to the
[01:31.720 --> 01:35.720]  the Greek people and so now the Greek people are set up with a choice as to
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.720]  whether or not they're going to stay in this union. A Prime Minister said as an
[01:39.720 --> 01:43.960]  equal member of the EU Greece does not need to ask permission from anyone to
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.400]  let the Greek people speak and have their voices heard. That's the Prime
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.320]  Minister Cyprus. He told Parliament and Parliament gave that power set up the
[01:51.320 --> 01:56.440]  referendum. Of course there have been referendum issues throughout different
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.280]  places in Europe and essentially we we had the one in Scotland that was just
[02:00.280 --> 02:06.120]  recently happened and I think it's very interesting to look at the reaction of
[02:06.120 --> 02:09.600]  the BBC for example because there was a lot of manipulation of public opinion
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.400]  when they were running up to that referendum in Scotland. They pushed by
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.760]  and told everybody it's going to be the end of the world and it may be currency
[02:17.760 --> 02:23.040]  controls coming down. The BBC reported that they would definitely have
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.440]  currency control. They said Greek Finance Minister had confirmed this to them
[02:27.440 --> 02:30.920]  nevertheless he immediately tweeted out and said capital controls within a
[02:30.920 --> 02:34.640]  monetary union or a contradiction in terms of Greek government opposes the
[02:34.640 --> 02:42.080]  very concept. So we have the BBC floating this idea out along with others who are
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.960]  part of the Troika saying that if they vote to not accept this deal it means
[02:47.960 --> 02:50.720]  that their cash is going to be confiscated. They're going to have currency
[02:50.720 --> 02:54.600]  control so they will not be able to get their cash at the banks but that may not
[02:54.600 --> 02:57.360]  be the position of the Greek government. Certainly they pushed back on that
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.200]  immediately. Is this another case of the BBC trying to manipulate people to
[03:03.200 --> 03:07.520]  manipulate public opinion? We've seen that happen before of course. It wouldn't
[03:07.520 --> 03:10.320]  be anything new. They also point out earlier on Saturday the Eurogroup
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.920]  decided that the Greek bailout program would not be extended beyond Tuesday.
[03:14.920 --> 03:20.640]  There is a 1.5 billion euro payment that is due to the IMF on Tuesday. If that
[03:20.640 --> 03:25.400]  doesn't happen it's going to hit the fan and this is something that's been in the
[03:25.400 --> 03:30.280]  cards for a long time. They're now holding still on their positions. This is
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.520]  the way it happens. It goes for a very very long time. People are lulled into a
[03:35.520 --> 03:40.640]  kind of apathy thinking that something will never happen. That's our concern
[03:40.640 --> 03:44.800]  here when we look at things like Jade Helm and other issues. They'll put
[03:44.800 --> 03:47.720]  something up and people will say well look this is where this is eventually
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.520]  headed. They'll say oh well it's going to happen immediately when it doesn't
[03:51.520 --> 03:55.600]  happen immediately when it doesn't happen the next time around. After a while
[03:55.600 --> 04:01.280]  people become numb to what is going on. We need to understand that when bankruptcy
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.760]  happens when tyranny happens it happens very gradually very slowly then it
[04:06.760 --> 04:10.360]  happens suddenly. So that's what the people of Greece need to understand.
[04:10.360 --> 04:13.800]  That's what we need to understand and when we look at world government we need
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.400]  to see how this is being manipulated within the EU within the euro currency.
[04:19.400 --> 04:22.920]  We know that came from the Bilderberg group back at their second meeting in
[04:22.920 --> 04:30.480]  1955. They proposed this exact situation. They said we're going to achieve
[04:30.480 --> 04:34.040]  political union first through economic union then through a centralized
[04:34.040 --> 04:41.040]  currency and then with crisis we can take over the political union. That's
[04:41.040 --> 04:44.200]  what we've seen floated out by Alan Greenspan. That's what we've seen floated
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.960]  out by the largest bond holding company in the world. Tymco has said the same
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.040]  thing. Either Greece is going to have to submit to this give up their sovereignty
[04:53.040 --> 04:59.040]  or get out. Stay with us. We're going to be right back. We're going to talk about this brave new world that has been unveiled this week.
[04:59.040 --> 05:03.360]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Now a lot of people are saying that they want to
[05:03.360 --> 05:07.520]  ban the Confederate flag. It seems because of what it represented. This is the
[05:07.520 --> 05:11.160]  thing though. Where will it stop? There has been more slavery under the current
[05:11.160 --> 05:15.280]  flag that we have than that of the Confederate flag. What a lot of people
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.920]  forget is that we have to learn from our past. We cannot erase what has happened
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.080]  by banning flags and taking everything down that reminds us of a bad past.
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.080]  Remember those who forget their past are doomed to repeat it all over again. We
[05:29.080 --> 05:32.720]  need our past however bad it may be to some of us so we can learn from those
[05:32.720 --> 05:37.200]  mistakes. A racing history sets us up to repeat those same mistakes over and over
[05:37.200 --> 05:41.600]  again. Now I was understanding that a lot of people see this as a flag that is
[05:41.600 --> 05:46.160]  racist and things like that but when you have places like Amazon and Google now
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.200]  banning the cells of Confederate memorabilia that's when you kind of
[05:50.200 --> 05:54.920]  cross the line. No, we have to keep this stuff out there so it is a reminder to
[05:54.920 --> 06:00.600]  never do that again. This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[06:05.880 --> 06:11.600]  Well it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we
[06:11.600 --> 06:17.760]  are now based is precisely this. That we are in process of developing a whole
[06:17.760 --> 06:27.000]  series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy have always
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.080]  existed and presumably always will exist. To get people actually to love their
[06:34.080 --> 06:51.280]  lives. This seems to me the ultimate in malevolent revolution. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:52.280 --> 06:57.480]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday June 28th 2015. I'm David Knight
[06:57.480 --> 07:02.000]  and that legrubris voice that you just heard there was Aldous Huxley. I asked
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.520]  the crew to play that because to me this last week has moved us so far into a
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.920]  brave new world. He talked about having people love their slavery and of course
[07:13.920 --> 07:17.240]  there's many ways that he proposed in the book that this would happen. Of course
[07:17.240 --> 07:22.200]  the central premise of Brave New World was a one-world government. We saw that
[07:22.200 --> 07:27.480]  happen being pushed this week in multiple ways. We saw the Pope selling a
[07:27.480 --> 07:33.240]  global government with a congress with a constitution with a planetary council
[07:33.240 --> 07:37.240]  and court. That's what his advisor pointed out. Of course he didn't
[07:37.240 --> 07:41.440]  specifically the Pope didn't have that in his encyclical but that's what the
[07:41.440 --> 07:46.160]  advisor that he appointed to his Pontifical Scientific Advisory Council
[07:46.160 --> 07:51.960]  has said in the past of course a big population control man as well. So we
[07:51.960 --> 07:56.480]  see the Pope pushing in the name of global warming for a world government.
[07:56.480 --> 08:01.040]  He said quite clearly this is a problem that had to be tackled at the world
[08:01.040 --> 08:05.760]  level. He said that states could no longer really handle this because we
[08:05.760 --> 08:10.460]  needed to control the multinational corporations that were the problem that
[08:10.460 --> 08:14.480]  we're bringing this on. The problem is it's the multinational corporations that
[08:14.480 --> 08:18.880]  already control the governments and the multinational corporations want that
[08:18.880 --> 08:23.560]  world government. We saw that as Congress moved ahead with fast-track to try
[08:23.560 --> 08:28.000]  to present these secret treaties that we've heard bits and pieces of. We've
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.840]  had Senator Sessions tell us about it but these are secret treaties that would
[08:31.840 --> 08:35.680]  create an economic union. They would do many things to us. They would not only
[08:35.680 --> 08:41.200]  surrender our jobs to other countries giving these multinational corporations
[08:41.200 --> 08:44.200]  or these secret organizations that have written this secret treaty give them
[08:44.200 --> 08:49.680]  power over our jobs over our economy. No, it would give them power over our food
[08:49.680 --> 08:54.520]  as well. It would give them power over our medicine, over the internet, very far
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.160]  reaching. But perhaps the most troubling thing about this is that once this is
[08:59.160 --> 09:02.520]  surrendered, once the Congress surrenders its power, and they've already
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.840]  surrendered the constitutional process of approving treaties, once
[09:06.840 --> 09:12.480]  they surrender the power of this treaty, once they surrender their oversight to
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.440]  this transnational body as Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions has pointed out, once
[09:19.440 --> 09:24.400]  they surrender to that, there will be no control by any government, not just our
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.800]  government, but any government of this transnational committee. They will be
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.560]  able to modify the agreement, add people as they wish, like China. We're told that
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.480]  this is a pushback against China. They'll be able to add people as they wish and
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.160]  they will be able to change it as they wish. Of course, immigration is going to
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.240]  be a part of that. Gun control can possibly be a part of that. So we have
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.240]  seen the Pope selling global government for the purpose of climate control. We've
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.040]  seen the Congress surrendering power to a transnational committee this last week.
[09:54.040 --> 10:00.880]  And we have seen the Supreme Court just arbitrarily operate however they wish,
[10:00.880 --> 10:08.880]  both Obamacare as well as the issue of marriage. They have just gone off the
[10:08.880 --> 10:12.640]  rails. Not even paying attention to the written law. The Constitution is no
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.360]  longer an issue for them. It's a living document. It's whatever they believe they
[10:17.360 --> 10:21.720]  would like to see happen, whether it's Obamacare subsidies or whether it is
[10:21.720 --> 10:28.840]  same-sex marriage. They push it through without any legal basis. A large part of
[10:28.840 --> 10:32.480]  this, of course, because we don't want to have anybody talking about the real
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.280]  legal basis of these decisions. A large part of Huxley's Brave New World was to
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.720]  discourage critical thinking. They wanted a population that was dumbed down, that
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.600]  was distracted, a population that was raised by the state. What do we have
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.960]  today? We see with these Supreme Court decisions, words don't mean anything. It
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.280]  means whatever they say it means. And when you have that, you create a
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.760]  dictatorship. You destroy the rule of law. Just as we've seen Congress turning
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.360]  over its legislative powers to some secretive undetermined transnational
[11:07.360 --> 11:13.280]  committee, we now have the Supreme Court just ignoring the rule of law, where
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.760]  words mean nothing at all, where we appeal to the authority of our leaders,
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.760]  the arbitrary whims of our leaders. The law is whatever they happen to say it
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.240]  is at any given point. That's the very definition of a dictatorship. And of
[11:28.240 --> 11:31.960]  course, one of the ways that they make this happen is by focusing the population
[11:31.960 --> 11:36.840]  on hedonism. That was a key part, of course, of Brave New World, that people
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.400]  would love their slavery. They would be so distracted by hedonism and the pursuit
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.960]  of pleasure as the supreme goal that they would not be able to think.
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.200]  Everything would be emotional. Even the movies in his book would become feelies.
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.520]  And that's what we have today. We have people making their decisions on their
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.440]  feelings, not paying any attention to the words and the Constitution. And also,
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.080]  there was the population control that Huxley had, where marriage was mocked,
[12:07.080 --> 12:11.200]  marriage was deconstructed, childbirth was vulgar. Is that what we're going to
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.000]  see with traditional marriage, with traditional families? I think it is.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.440]  Welcome to the Brave New World, where we've got world government, we've got
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.520]  population control, we've got abortion, we've got abolition of natural marriage
[12:23.520 --> 12:28.400]  and reproduction. We have a population that is dumbed down and distracted by
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.080]  hedonism. Now, if you don't buy into that, if you see what's happening, they've got
[12:34.080 --> 12:39.960]  another plan for you, another novel. It's called 1984. Let's take a look at this
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.200]  Supreme Court decision. We have an article on Infowars.com Samuel Alito, one of
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.640]  the Supreme Court justices who dissented from the marriage decision, says
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.840]  defenders of traditional marriage now risk being treated as bigots by
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.580]  governments, employers, and schools. Justice Samuel Alito said the court had
[12:58.580 --> 13:02.840]  falsely likened opposition to same-sex marriage to racism and said the
[13:02.840 --> 13:07.680]  decision will be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.080]  new orthodoxy. Let me read you some of his decision here. He said, today's
[13:12.080 --> 13:15.920]  decision usurps the constitutional right of people to decide whether to keep or
[13:15.920 --> 13:19.720]  to alter the traditional understanding of marriage. The decision will also have
[13:19.720 --> 13:25.120]  other important consequences. It will be used to vilify Americans who are
[13:25.120 --> 13:30.600]  unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy. We have already seen that. This is not a
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.900]  theory. We have seen that with these bakery decisions. Remember the Oregon
[13:35.900 --> 13:40.600]  Bakery, the small business that was fined $135,000 by an administrative judge
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.520]  saying that they had discriminated because they would not bake a cake that
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.920]  had something to do with homosexual marriage. They said, that violates my
[13:49.920 --> 13:53.920]  religious beliefs to do that. They said, we don't care what your religious beliefs
[13:53.920 --> 13:56.000]  are. We don't care what your religious beliefs are when it comes to
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.240]  vaccinating your kids. We don't care what your personal consent is. They no
[13:59.240 --> 14:03.000]  longer care, but the key thing, and he points this out, is that they have in the
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.140]  Supreme Court decision, the majority equated this with denying African
[14:08.140 --> 14:13.080]  Americans and women equal protection under the law. That's why they referenced
[14:13.080 --> 14:18.600]  the 14th Amendment. And of course, the 14th Amendment came in as part of an
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.960]  answer to Reconstruction and the blowback that happened in Reconstruction
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.920]  against, it was against the federal government, but they turned it against the
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.680]  black people. The same as the federal government is now trying to create a
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.040]  race war here. That was what came out of Reconstruction. And so to stop that, the
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.240]  14th Amendment was put in to say that no state shall deprive any person of life,
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.000]  liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny any person within its
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.280]  jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. That was to give human rights,
[14:51.280 --> 14:57.280]  citizen rights, to the slaves that had been freed by the 13th Amendment. Now,
[14:57.280 --> 15:04.240]  that was referenced and rightfully so in a court case called Loving, where it was
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.000]  about interracial marriage that had been prohibited by law in some southern
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.920]  state. And that was precisely what the 14th Amendment was written to stop. But
[15:14.920 --> 15:17.960]  then they took that and said, well, because that was marriage kind of
[15:17.960 --> 15:23.480]  tangentially involved, they expanded that to include all marriage. And we
[15:23.480 --> 15:27.400]  understand from the 10th Amendment that the federal government that was created
[15:27.400 --> 15:33.760]  by sovereign states well after the Revolution was given specific and
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.440]  limited things. They were very concerned that power was going to be
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.360]  consolidated to the center. So they divided power in multiple ways and
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.800]  within the center and said, if we haven't specifically given you powers, you
[15:47.800 --> 15:51.800]  cannot presume those powers. But that is what they did this week with both the
[15:51.800 --> 15:57.840]  marriage decision and with Obamacare. Stay with us. We're going to be right back.
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.960]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.080]  entire city has been told not to drink the water. Ohio governor declaring a
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.840]  state of emergency. Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100

[17:02.480 --> 17:06.080]  manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.560]  or the news website infowars.com because the companies I've been approached by
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.000]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.160]  so I refused. Probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[17:20.160 --> 17:25.800]  about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.

[18:12.560 --> 18:17.360]  have rejected literally hundreds of products from the info wars life line
[18:17.360 --> 18:21.800]  because they are not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100%
[18:21.800 --> 18:26.680]  organic or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are
[18:26.680 --> 18:30.960]  that we have listed at infowarslife.com whether it's survival shield nascent

[19:59.760 --> 20:07.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.760 --> 20:37.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight your host today. We have a
[20:37.480 --> 20:41.120]  lot of news. It's not just about the Supreme Court decision this week but we
[20:41.120 --> 20:46.400]  have seen multiple ways in which we have lost the rule of law. It's been
[20:46.400 --> 20:50.560]  surrendered to transnational bodies or people pushing for it to be surrendered
[20:50.560 --> 20:54.880]  to transnational bodies in the way of the trade promotion authority. We're
[20:54.880 --> 20:57.840]  going to quickly see these trade agreements they've been crafting for
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.040]  years that will be comprehensive. They will affect every aspect of our lives
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.600]  whether we see that initially or not and of course it will remove control from
[21:08.600 --> 21:12.880]  our governments to a central transnational committee. That's what
[21:12.880 --> 21:17.200]  we've been told by the senators who have seen this. Nevertheless we rushed
[21:17.200 --> 21:22.160]  headlong into that. We have rushed headlong into lawless Supreme Court
[21:22.160 --> 21:24.960]  decisions and I'm going to talk about that but before I do I want to let you
[21:24.960 --> 21:29.040]  know this hour of the Alex Jones show. It's made possible by your support of the
[21:29.040 --> 21:33.840]  high-quality products we sell at infowarslife.com. Products like our
[21:33.840 --> 21:38.640]  survival shield X2 nascent iodine. You know for me it's a no-brainer to take
[21:38.640 --> 21:42.720]  this. It's a habit. I do it every day. Every morning I take this along with other
[21:42.720 --> 21:46.400]  supplements that I get and I prefer because I take so many supplements I
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.360]  prefer to take them in liquid form because I know they're highly bioavailable
[21:50.360 --> 21:54.760]  in liquid form. I don't have to swallow a lot of pills but I know that this
[21:54.760 --> 21:59.160]  works. Survival shield X2 is one of the best ways that you can get a vital
[21:59.160 --> 22:05.960]  supplement iodine that you need in your diet. We also have liver shield that I
[22:05.960 --> 22:10.280]  was going to start this last weekend but it's now out of stock and if you're
[22:10.280 --> 22:14.760]  wanting to start a liver cleanse you can also get on the waiting list at
[22:14.760 --> 22:20.280]  infowarslife.com and we will email you when that comes back in. Again liver
[22:20.280 --> 22:24.240]  shield is out of stock but right now you can get X2 nascent iodine. That was out
[22:24.240 --> 22:27.840]  of stock for quite a while so now is a good time to stock up on that. We have
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.920]  over 400 reviews on infowarslife.com. 99% of the respondents would recommend it
[22:32.920 --> 22:37.920]  to a friend or to a family member so get your bottle of X2. Read the more than
[22:37.920 --> 22:43.760]  400 reviews and you can see all of that at infowarslife.com. That's infowarslife.com.
[22:43.760 --> 22:49.120]  Now as I was just pointing out in the last segment what we have seen here with
[22:49.120 --> 22:55.320]  the multiple things that have happened this last week it was pretty clear
[22:55.320 --> 23:00.960]  where this is headed and I just read you some of the statements from Justice
[23:00.960 --> 23:07.320]  Alito saying that well perhaps perhaps we will be allowed to whisper our
[23:07.320 --> 23:11.760]  thoughts if we have any dissenting thoughts about this in the recesses of
[23:11.760 --> 23:17.440]  our homes but if we repeat those views in public we will risk being labeled as
[23:17.440 --> 23:22.000]  bigots and treated as such by governments by employers by schools. That's
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.240]  what he wrote in his decision and also as I pointed out before this is
[23:25.240 --> 23:31.840]  something that is not the authority of the federal government. The Tenth
[23:31.840 --> 23:36.280]  Amendment would make that case. He says the system of federalism established by
[23:36.280 --> 23:39.560]  our Constitution provides a way for people with different beliefs to live
[23:39.560 --> 23:43.920]  together in a single nation. If the issue of same-sex marriage had been left to
[23:43.920 --> 23:46.880]  the people of the states it's likely that some states would have recognized
[23:46.880 --> 23:50.880]  same-sex marriage others would not. It's also possible some states would tie
[23:50.880 --> 23:56.280]  recognition to protection for conscience rights. The majority today make that
[23:56.280 --> 24:01.280]  impossible in the Supreme Court by imposing its own views on the entire
[24:01.280 --> 24:06.160]  country. The Supreme Court majority facilitates the marginalization of many
[24:06.160 --> 24:10.560]  Americans who have traditional ideas. Recalling the harsh treatment of gays
[24:10.560 --> 24:15.400]  and lesbians in the past some may think that a turnaround is fair play but if
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.800]  that sentiment prevails the nation will experience bitter and lasting wounds.
[24:20.800 --> 24:27.320]  Yes because you know political correctness is not about tolerance. That's
[24:27.320 --> 24:32.840]  simply the mask that it wears. They will not tolerate your dissent and that's
[24:32.840 --> 24:35.760]  fundamentally what this is about. We can see it already happening. Look at this
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.480]  from the mirror, the silent scene. A paper will limit anti-gay marriage op-eds.
[24:40.480 --> 24:44.200]  This is a paper in Pennsylvania, the Penn Live, Patriot News and Harrisburg,
[24:44.200 --> 24:47.760]  Pennsylvania says they're taking a hardcore stance against those who
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.920]  disagree with the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. They said as a result of
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.880]  Friday's ruling their paper the Penn Live, Patriot News will no longer accept
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.720]  nor will it print op-eds and letters to the editor in opposition to same-sex
[25:01.720 --> 25:08.760]  marriage. A lot of people were outraged by that that a newspaper would shut
[25:08.760 --> 25:12.560]  down any dissent of that and so they revised their policy and said
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.240]  clarification we will not foreclose discussion of the High Court's decision
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.080]  but arguments that gay marriage is wrong or unnatural are out. And as one
[25:21.080 --> 25:24.800]  person wrote, well I don't mind who's marrying who but it's a good day to be a
[25:24.800 --> 25:29.240]  divorce lawyer. Well that's true there's going to be a lot more opportunity for
[25:29.240 --> 25:34.640]  divorce lawyers to practice their trade but there's also going to be a lot more
[25:34.640 --> 25:40.560]  of the type of thing that we saw at the bakeries that were compelled to bake
[25:40.560 --> 25:45.240]  cakes that they felt violated their religious beliefs, refused on a
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.240]  religious basis. Nevertheless they said that they were discriminating against
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.200]  others gave them a very heavy fine and we're going to see organizations like
[25:53.200 --> 25:57.920]  the ACLU jump into this as well because it's not just destroying freedom of
[25:57.920 --> 26:02.840]  religion and also freedom of speech. It's both parts of the First Amendment. Now
[26:02.840 --> 26:07.800]  the ACLU says on the Washington Post why we can no longer support the federal
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.080]  religious freedom law. Now they point out by saying they've supported
[26:13.080 --> 26:18.880]  the the law that Congress put into effect which was supposed to strengthen
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.520]  the First Amendment's protection of the free exercise of religion. See your
[26:24.520 --> 26:27.880]  beliefs are not something that you need to keep hidden in a clause that you
[26:27.880 --> 26:32.280]  actually are allowed to exercise your religion according to the First
[26:32.280 --> 26:37.280]  Amendment. That's a human right and it was explicitly recognized in the Supreme
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.240]  Law of the land that every one of these people who serves in government has
[26:41.240 --> 26:47.080]  taken an oath to uphold. See the Constitution is really the king. These
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.680]  people who are in office are merely temporary placeholders, stewards,
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.360]  representatives of ours but they swear to uphold the Constitution. Nevertheless
[26:56.360 --> 27:01.320]  they're not interested in protecting the free exercise of religion except when
[27:01.320 --> 27:04.600]  it comes to perhaps trivial things. So that's what the ACLU is talking about.
[27:04.600 --> 27:11.200]  They say well you know we've had this case of a guy who was an Indian, a Sikh
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.440]  and he wanted to join the army but he didn't want to have to shave his beard,
[27:15.440 --> 27:18.760]  cut his hair, remove his turban because that was part of his religious belief and
[27:18.760 --> 27:23.880]  they say the army has allowed beards for other people, for Jewish men. They let
[27:23.880 --> 27:27.920]  them wear yarmulkes. They let women wear their hair long because of religious
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.920]  beliefs. So the ACLU supports that kind of thing. See the ACLU is always there
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.760]  for the trivial issues or the things that are very controversial but not
[27:38.760 --> 27:44.160]  consequential. Things like standing up and supporting the right of Nazis to
[27:44.160 --> 27:49.840]  parade through a predominantly Jewish town in Illinois but they will not stand
[27:49.840 --> 27:56.960]  up for your right to have equal access to the ballot. See we have a controlled
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.120]  electoral process that begins by saying that independent candidates and
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.360]  independent parties cannot get on the ballot. That's essentially controlled by
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.640]  the two major parties. They have laws in every state. They keep third parties
[28:10.640 --> 28:15.920]  and independents from participating. We could never get the ACLU to help us to
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.400]  do that when I was working with third parties in North Carolina. They don't
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.000]  want to do anything that is really consequential. They'll get out there and
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.560]  they'll support the rights of Nazis to march up and down and be provocative or
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.440]  even the rights of the Ku Klux Clowns. But they won't support your right to
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.920]  exercise your religion and so they list in this op-ed piece here. They talk about
[28:35.920 --> 28:39.360]  the Hobby Lobby case because you know we can't have people exercising their
[28:39.360 --> 28:42.840]  freedom of religion when we've got an unconstitutional mandate to buy
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.000]  insurance that we need to shove down their throats and that's the way they're
[28:47.000 --> 28:59.720]  going to look at this decision with marriage. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[28:59.720 --> 29:03.640]  Ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and

[36:30.120 --> 36:33.560]  segment we're out of stock on the liver shield but you can still sign up for
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.200]  that when it gets back in stock you will be given an email and the first chance
[36:37.200 --> 36:42.440]  to get it we do have a survival shield x2 back in stock which has been out of
[36:42.440 --> 36:47.600]  stock for a while so again stock up on it when you can because they come and go
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.280]  and you don't want to be left especially with something as important as iodine to
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.200]  your diet to your survival if we have a new usual circumstance let's just put it
[36:58.200 --> 37:02.720]  that way we had the federal government buying millions of doses of iodine you
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.480]  might ask go why did they do it well there's a reason that they do it and
[37:06.480 --> 37:10.640]  you want to have your supply as well so that's also in stock right now now as I
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.120]  was talking about the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage in the
[37:14.120 --> 37:19.760]  last a couple of segments I found it just a surprising that the pope was
[37:19.760 --> 37:24.000]  totally silent on this as I found it surprising that he was pushing for a
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.680]  global regime in the name of global warming this last week and of course we
[37:28.680 --> 37:33.560]  did have the US Catholic bishops make a statement and the strange thing about it
[37:33.560 --> 37:38.120]  to me was this is what he had to say he said the unique meaning of marriage as
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.920]  the union of one man and one woman and this is the Archbishop Kurtz of Louis
[37:42.920 --> 37:46.720] ville Kentucky's president of the US Conference of Catholic bishops he said
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.280]  the unique meaning of marriage between one man one woman is inscribed in our
[37:50.280 --> 37:53.440]  bodies as male and female and this is what I think is interesting he says the
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.960]  protection of this meaning is a critical dimension of the integral ecology quote
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.640]  unquote he puts that in quotes that Pope Francis has called us to promote so
[38:03.640 --> 38:09.240]  even he doesn't really appeal to any biblical authority or any papal authority
[38:09.240 --> 38:15.280]  to support marriage instead he talks about integral ecology and after the as
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.000]  they were looking at the encyclical that was coming from the pope the Huffington
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.960]  Post had an article about Pope Francis's integral ecology they said
[38:23.960 --> 38:28.600]  there's a new term being bandied about and it's high time we paid heed integral
[38:28.600 --> 38:33.240]  ecology they say whenever the same notion arises synchronously in a number
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.960]  of different contexts in this case the Catholic Church the Occupy movement the
[38:37.960 --> 38:43.360]  climate movement the new economy movement it's an idea whose time has
[38:43.360 --> 38:51.160]  arrived no it is an idea that is part of a propaganda campaign coming from the
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.360]  socialist left that and the world government people the Occupy movement
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.440]  now what the pope is doing is using this and promoting scientists who have
[38:59.440 --> 39:03.200]  called for population control and world government and of course that's all part
[39:03.200 --> 39:09.760]  of the new economy movement so the only way that they could try to justify
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.560]  supporting traditional marriage was to refer to the pope's pronouncement about
[39:15.560 --> 39:20.080]  global warming and of course it's in one way it's not surprising that they would
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.480]  do this because if I as I've said before climate change really is a religion as a
[39:25.480 --> 39:32.040]  matter of fact the guy who was head of the UN Council for that the UN IPCC said
[39:32.040 --> 39:38.960]  climate change is my religion my Dharma they've made no bones about that they
[39:38.960 --> 39:44.560]  have always argued from the position of authority they say we are the experts
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.160]  and if you heard the program on Friday when I talked to Mark Dice and we went
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.000]  through all of these different petitions that he's done in California the
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.600]  underlying theme of all of that is just the blatant appeal to authority if he
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.440]  would come up to somebody and say do this for Obama sign this petition for
[40:02.440 --> 40:07.720]  Obama they would do it or if you tell them the majority of scientists believe
[40:07.720 --> 40:11.360]  that this is going to happen they will do it that's why today I brought in I
[40:11.360 --> 40:14.960]  want you to get a picture of this magazine on the desk here I brought in
[40:14.960 --> 40:22.600]  a an issue of Newsweek a special report from July 16th 1979 36 years ago the
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.640]  energy crisis a program for the 80s now when I open this up to that report a
[40:28.640 --> 40:34.200]  program for the 80s they have this page here why we must act now and if you can
[40:34.200 --> 40:39.800]  see this back in 1979 the experts the authorities that were supposed to defer
[40:39.800 --> 40:45.840]  to unquestioningly told us that we had 8.7 years left of crude oil we had only
[40:45.840 --> 40:55.640]  10.7 years left of natural gas we have kind of a glut of right now but they
[40:55.640 --> 40:58.240]  were telling us that we had to act because we only had about 10 years left
[40:58.240 --> 41:02.520]  and that was back in 1979 that's what the experts were telling us and of course
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.120]  if you look down through this article they had all kinds of stuff like yeah
[41:05.120 --> 41:10.640]  we need a massive new tax because we need to control and ration this resource
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.280]  what are they proposing with a global climate change control well massive new
[41:15.280 --> 41:18.760]  taxes but of course they won't be going to any national government they will be
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.560]  going to an international government they will be going to some bankers who
[41:23.560 --> 41:27.960]  will use that as kind of a religious indulgence force so whenever we see
[41:27.960 --> 41:34.480]  these kinds of pronouncements by the authorities and we see this kind of
[41:34.480 --> 41:39.320]  consensus among scientists we need to take that with a grain of salt and I
[41:39.320 --> 41:45.520]  know many of you did I saved this article because I knew it was total
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.840]  bunk I knew it would be something we could all laugh at in a few years and
[41:49.840 --> 41:55.920]  it is absolutely absurd to predict that by the late 1980s we were going to be
[41:55.920 --> 41:59.640]  out of all but I remember pop tunes about that there's only so much oil in
[41:59.640 --> 42:04.200]  the ground I mean that was from Tower of Power it was a great song but had
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.160]  nonsense lyrics but we've seen that push through the culture that was what
[42:09.160 --> 42:12.840]  everybody was saying at that point in time we have reached peak oil we're
[42:12.840 --> 42:16.720]  going to be out of crude oil that didn't happen so now they're trying to find a
[42:16.720 --> 42:22.240]  different way to control our energy use because that is the ultimate way that
[42:22.240 --> 42:26.040]  they can control you is through energy use but they're not going to be content
[42:26.040 --> 42:29.760]  with that they come at us from multiple directions just as we saw this last
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.400]  week we had calls for world government from the Pope but we also had calls and
[42:34.400 --> 42:38.600]  and pushing towards world government from these trade treaties these trade
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.240]  agreements they're also not going to limit themselves just to controlling your
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.040]  energy of course they're going to come after you medically I want to read you
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.580]  the story when we come back the mysterious death of a doctor who spoke

[47:34.400 --> 47:40.680]  it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight your
[47:40.680 --> 47:46.880]  host today on this Sunday June 28th 2015 you didn't see it in the last segment
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.160]  we're gonna keep putting this up here the projection from Newsweek back in
[47:51.160 --> 47:57.320]  1979 how we only had 8.7 years left of crude oil and we only had 10.7 years
[47:57.320 --> 48:03.280]  left of natural gas notice how precise those numbers are 8.7 years left and
[48:03.280 --> 48:09.240]  10.7 years left okay so we would have been 20 years ago out of both crude oil
[48:09.240 --> 48:13.800]  and natural gas if the experts were right but of course they always argue
[48:13.800 --> 48:16.480]  from authority pull that up one more time because there's a third one here
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.040]  that I didn't mention and that is coal they had worked out that we had
[48:20.040 --> 48:29.160]  precisely 666.5 years left so at some point it was gonna be like on New
[48:29.160 --> 48:36.160]  Years Eve 666 years from 1979 because this was in July or whatever they were
[48:36.160 --> 48:41.640]  going to run out of we'll run out of coal so there you go so we had to act
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.320]  then and you know it's interesting to see that their prescriptions were the
[48:45.320 --> 48:49.600]  same that we see for global warming and climate change now massive new taxes
[48:49.600 --> 48:56.160]  rationing government control that's always a solution crisis solution and
[48:56.160 --> 49:02.160]  they offer us a phony bad outcome that isn't going to really happen there you
[49:02.160 --> 49:05.800]  go you can see that massive new taxes that they're talking about but of course
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.120]  we have today a government that is not really even trying to scare us into
[49:11.120 --> 49:14.280]  action they're just going to hold a gun to your head that's what the trade
[49:14.280 --> 49:18.000]  agreements are essentially about but they're going to start trying to ram
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.500]  through Congress this probably pretty soon they've already written these trade
[49:22.500 --> 49:26.640]  agreements they got fast-track past last week and of course there are
[49:26.640 --> 49:30.560]  multiple bills throughout this country especially in California where they're
[49:30.560 --> 49:34.960]  just going to hold a gun to your head and say we don't really care what you're
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.280]  about your consent we don't care what you believe we don't care that you're
[49:39.280 --> 49:43.240]  concerned about risks you don't get to make those decisions you're going to do
[49:43.240 --> 49:46.640]  what we have to say the science is settled and you're just going to do it
[49:46.640 --> 49:49.960]  in the same way that the science was settled in the late 70s that we were
[49:49.960 --> 49:55.560]  going to run out of oil in 10 years we didn't and the science is not settled
[49:55.560 --> 49:58.920]  about climate change the science is not settled about vaccines take a look at
[49:58.920 --> 50:03.520]  this story from science daily whooping cough resurgence due to vaccinated people
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.240]  not knowing their infectious question mark this is from four days ago they say
[50:08.240 --> 50:14.480]  whooping cough has made an astonishing comeback with 2012 seeing nearly 50,000
[50:14.480 --> 50:18.960]  infections in the US the most since 1955 and a death rate in infants three times
[50:18.960 --> 50:23.480]  out of the rest of the population the dramatic resurgence has puzzled health
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.520]  officials and they think that perhaps it's this anti-vaccine sentiment that
[50:28.520 --> 50:34.080]  is the likely culprit no that might not be the story says science daily they
[50:34.080 --> 50:39.040]  say that a recent study published by BMC medicine in the in the Santa Fe
[50:39.040 --> 50:43.800]  Institute they looked at their the research pointed out to a different but
[50:43.800 --> 50:47.960]  related source of the outbreak they said vaccinated people who are
[50:47.960 --> 50:53.000]  infectious but do not display the symptoms of whooping cough suggesting
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.080]  the number of people transmitting without symptoms may be many times greater
[50:57.080 --> 51:02.480]  than those transmitting with symptoms we have seen this with multiple diseases
[51:02.480 --> 51:07.200]  that they vaccinate for we've seen this with an outbreak in New York where the
[51:07.200 --> 51:13.640]  were patient zero was twice vaccinated patient zero transmitted that to four
[51:13.640 --> 51:17.240]  other patients who had also been vaccinated two of them twice the other
[51:17.240 --> 51:20.440]  two had antibodies that didn't have records for them so they didn't know if
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.960]  they'd had one or two vaccinations nevertheless all the people in that
[51:24.960 --> 51:28.400]  outbreak and we I could go over a case after case after case that's not the
[51:28.400 --> 51:33.200]  only one this is happening constantly so the two things to take away from this
[51:33.200 --> 51:38.240]  is that number one it's not conveying immunity if it doesn't convey individual
[51:38.240 --> 51:42.440]  immunity you're not going to get herd immunity that is just smoke and mirrors
[51:42.440 --> 51:47.160]  that's waving their hand over the fundamental issue that the vaccines are
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.560]  not effective and then the other part of it is that they actually can create
[51:51.560 --> 51:55.280]  little typhoid Marys who are going out there unintentionally spreading the
[51:55.280 --> 51:58.920]  disease but I find it also interesting that on the same page over on the side
[51:58.920 --> 52:02.680]  there's a side article that says whooping cough vaccine recommended for
[52:02.680 --> 52:07.240]  pregnant women now because of a spike in cases on the same page where they're
[52:07.240 --> 52:10.880]  saying that people are transmitting this and that they're having a high
[52:10.880 --> 52:15.360]  infant mortality they're going to give it to pregnant women so the pregnant
[52:15.360 --> 52:20.080]  women can then it shed that to their infants either before or after birth
[52:20.080 --> 52:24.880]  presumably this is the kind of junk science that we're continuously seeing
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.280]  and yet when you have somebody who is actually getting some results they come
[52:30.280 --> 52:35.360]  after him they come after him and destroy his reputation even attack him
[52:35.360 --> 52:40.080]  posthumously this is a story of Dr. Jeff Bradstreet this is a story that a
[52:40.080 --> 52:45.280]  Don Salazar picked up on Friday and it was about a week after the doctor was
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.760]  found his body was he they found his body floating in the river in North
[52:49.760 --> 52:54.800]  Carolina and the title of the article is mysterious death body of doctor who
[52:54.800 --> 53:00.000]  linked vaccines to autism was found floating in a river say a prominent
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.080]  autism researcher and vaccine opponent was found dead floating in a North
[53:03.080 --> 53:07.080]  Carolina River last week under what many are calling suspicious circumstances
[53:07.080 --> 53:12.480]  they say that he had a gunshot wound to the chest which appeared to be self
[53:12.480 --> 53:18.000]  inflicted according to deputies and they removed a handgun from the river now I
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.280]  ask you is that a the way that people typically commit suicide with handguns
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.200]  shooting themselves in the chest that doesn't seem likely to me but here's
[53:28.200 --> 53:31.880]  the background of dr. Bradstreet here's what you need to know about him he ran
[53:31.880 --> 53:35.600]  a private practice in Buford Georgia which focused on treating children with
[53:35.600 --> 53:41.000]  autism spectrum disorder ppd and related neurological and developmental
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.200]  disorders among various remedies dr. Bradstreet's wellness center reportedly
[53:45.200 --> 53:49.480]  carried out mercury toxicity treatments believing that the heavy metal mercury
[53:49.480 --> 53:53.360]  was the leading factor in the development of childhood autism and of
[53:53.360 --> 53:58.360]  course mercury was a part of the vaccines a big part of the backs vaccines
[53:58.360 --> 54:02.040]  in terms of thimerosal which is a preservative they have removed that
[54:02.040 --> 54:05.880]  from some of the vaccines now but they were they would put that in the
[54:05.880 --> 54:11.160]  vaccines as preservatives I remember taking thimerosal for a contact lens
[54:11.160 --> 54:15.520]  cleaning solution and every time I would use that contacts lens cleaning
[54:15.520 --> 54:22.600]  solution it would turn my eyes bright blood red immediately and I complained
[54:22.600 --> 54:29.960]  to the the optometrist and he said well you're probably allergic to thimerosal
[54:29.960 --> 54:34.040]  so we'll have to give you something else that's that's different years later
[54:34.040 --> 54:38.680]  when I had another doctor talking to me about why I didn't use contact lenses
[54:38.680 --> 54:44.080]  anymore he said oh thimerosal that's been banned that's got mercury in it it's
[54:44.080 --> 54:50.080]  like oh really that's the same stuff they put as a preservative in vaccines and I
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.400]  noticed an immediate reaction in my eyes so how do you know that you're not
[54:54.400 --> 54:58.640]  going to have a reaction to that we don't know which people are genetically
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.080]  predisposed to have a reaction to it but he found a link to mercury he had
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.560]  worked on that and several people had said he said autism taught him more
[55:07.560 --> 55:13.880]  about medicine than his entire time in medical school they say several people
[55:13.880 --> 55:18.320]  left comments on his Facebook page dr. Bradstreet was my son's doctor after my
[55:18.320 --> 55:22.360]  son was diagnosed with autism he worked miracles at 16 my son is now looking at
[55:22.360 --> 55:25.760]  a normal life thanks to him and I thank him every day another one said I will
[55:25.760 --> 55:29.840]  forever be grateful and thankful to dr. Bradstreet for recovering my son from
[55:29.840 --> 55:35.680]  autism they have set up a go fund me page to they say try to find answers to
[55:35.680 --> 55:39.600]  many questions leading up to the death of dr. Bradstreet including an exhaustive
[55:39.600 --> 55:42.920]  investigation and the possibility of foul play now here's what's also
[55:42.920 --> 55:47.440]  interesting about this not only is it questionable that he was trying to
[55:47.440 --> 55:52.160]  commit suicide with a shot in the chest instead of shooting himself in the head
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.480]  if he was trying to commit suicide they say that circumstances surrounding his
[55:56.480 --> 56:02.680]  death are made more curious by a recent multi-agency raid that was led by the
[56:02.680 --> 56:08.320]  FDA at his offices they say the FDA is yet to reveal why agents searched the
[56:08.320 --> 56:13.120]  office of the doctor reportedly a former pastor who has been controversial for
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.240]  well over a decade so one person commented and said self-inflicted in the
[56:18.240 --> 56:23.960]  chest I'm not buying it this was a doctor who had access to pharmaceuticals of
[56:23.960 --> 56:29.880]  all kinds this was a religious man with a thriving medical practice sorry but
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.680]  this stinks of murder and a cover-up very interesting story and it's also
[56:34.680 --> 56:39.800]  interesting how this this turned out as as adan told me he put this story up
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.280]  about a week after it happened and it only at that point been covered by the
[56:44.280 --> 56:52.760]  local paper and one other publication which was it was WHS I believe was the
[56:52.760 --> 56:58.640]  station that it was carried at WHNS after we put it up it got picked up the
[56:58.640 --> 57:05.640]  next day by the Daily Mail by Forbes Time NBC ABC News everyone picking up the
[57:05.640 --> 57:10.320]  story but pushing back on him and pushing back on the idea of not only his
[57:10.320 --> 57:15.960]  career but the idea foul play very interesting we can't have an effect it
[57:15.960 --> 57:20.640]  is something that we need to remember that we can push out there the
[57:20.640 --> 57:26.040]  information and we can get that exposed after we reported it was reported on
[57:26.040 --> 57:30.920]  about two dozen different media outlets many of them major media outlets what
[57:30.920 --> 57:36.440]  we need to look at is the research that this doctor has discovered and the
[57:36.440 --> 57:39.480]  techniques that he used to help people say with us we're gonna be right back

[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.920]  deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:16.520]  GCN radio network welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.480]  host in the last segment we were talking about the mysterious death of Dr. Jeff
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.400]  Bradstreet who was found floating in a river in North Carolina with a single
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:33.800]  gunshot wound to the chest they found a handgun not a shotgun in the in the in
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:38.160]  the river they're blaming it on a suicide nevertheless as one person pointed out
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.760]  this is a guy who was very religious he was a pastor he also had access to all
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.480]  kinds of medications and it is also not likely that someone would commit suicide
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.120]  by shooting themselves in the chest also adding to the mystery is why after
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.160]  he'd been controversial for his treatment and cure of many people who had
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:03.280]  autism saying that he believed that it was connected to mercury after doing
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:10.160]  this for well over a decade he was rated by multiple agencies led by the FDA we
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:16.200]  know that the FDA is moving to shut down nature paths they've put out a comment
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.960]  period indicating that they're going to come up with a lot of regulations to
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.880]  shut that down they are concentrating this medical tyranny one of the key
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:31.280]  things about that is to remove our informed consent and one of the ways
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.720]  that that happens is not only forcing you to take medication that they
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.640]  prescribe when they prescribe it in the dosages that they prescribe removing
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:45.160]  your ability to make that decision for yourself or for your family but also to
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.600]  withhold other medication from you here's a story that came out on Friday
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:55.000]  a teen who is now breathing on his own after a controversial cannabis treatment
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.680]  you see it's not only autism that people have linked to vaccines but in many
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.320]  many cases people have seen their children go into continuous and
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:11.560]  uncontrollable convulsions immediately after getting vaccinated as an adverse
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.360]  condition and it appears that the only thing that really works against that is
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:22.880]  cannabis oil we just had the Texas legislature recognize that by putting
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.640]  in the very first exemption for medical marijuana here in Texas for that
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.400]  specific condition uncontrollable epileptic seizures and as David Simpson
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.760]  who is floating a broader based legalization of marijuana pointed
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.680]  out many parents here in Texas many who were constituents of his told him
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.480]  about their children who had been injured after vaccines having to become
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.800]  essentially exiles go live in Colorado one of them was able to do it to go live
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.080]  in Colorado to give cannabis oil to their child where it's legal the other
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:04.120]  Texas family could not afford to do that he said it was outrageous that that would
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.320]  occur here in Texas now we have had a law passed that recognizes that that is
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:15.400]  very effective this teen is out of New Zealand this is out of Nelson New Zealand
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.920]  they said he breathes by himself now with no help at all his heart is strong
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.080]  his lungs are strong it's a big development they say he had been
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.240]  essentially in a coma but he's now breathing on his own he occasionally
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.160]  opens his eyes and they had to send cannabis oil from the United States they
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.840]  had to get special permission to do that why do we need to get special
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.080]  permission from the government for this kind of treatment why do we need to get
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.200]  special permission from the FDA if you want to try an experimental treatment
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.320]  from Big Pharma for cancer you have to get their permission why should we be
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.600]  limited to those types of things if it's a life or death situation inform people
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.440]  of the risks let them make the choice it was interesting I thought when they had
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.720]  the the mandatory vaccine bill that was put up in I think it was Oregon it's
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.440]  either Oregon or Washington there was a senator up there who was a doctor and
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.440]  they pointed out in those hearings that she had done the same thing that she was
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:23.400]  trying to deny other people the right to do in her case she had suffered from a
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:30.080]  condition and the medication that she took for her condition was not supposed
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.560]  to be taken while she was pregnant she did her research she didn't feel that
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.280]  it was going to be a threat to her child she did it anyway and they said

[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.120]  talking about today the massive sea changes that we've seen in just the
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.600]  last week with the passing of fast-track and the trade agreements that may be
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.120]  coming through with that the global governance that that will usher in if
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.800]  those trade agreements are passed the Pope speaking out for world government
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.800]  in the name of climate change and then of course the two Supreme Court decisions
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.000]  that we had this last week that will have a massive effect in terms of one the
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.760]  same-sex marriage issue as well as the one on Obamacare yet another just flat
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:22.600]  out ignoring what the law says as Scalia says we're just making this up we
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.200]  ought to call it SCOTUS care but yet again we see Justice Roberts coming in
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.720]  to the rescue of Obamacare first pronouncing that it wasn't an
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:37.080]  unconstitutional mandate to buy somebody's products then saying that it
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.280]  was a tax instead and they could do it and then coming in this last week and
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:46.520]  rewriting the bill for Congress because they were going to have independent on
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.800]  state exchanges subsidizing it may the state did not put those exchanges in so
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.920]  to make it work Justice Roberts and the majority said we'll just ignore what the
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.200]  law says because we know what they intended it doesn't matter what they
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.840]  wrote it doesn't matter what the words say we'll just go with what they
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.760]  intended before we get to your calls before we get to some more news I want

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.080]  another one here too from Mike see and San Rafael California he says are you
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.040]  looking for more energy how about more passion maybe you'd like a little more

[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.160]  we're getting back to the news I'm gonna go to your calls in just one moment I
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.880]  want to cover one more story here because I thought this is really
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.520]  interesting especially because of Jurassic Park the the fourth in the
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.600]  series coming out this week was it Jurassic World I think I came out about
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.160]  a week and a half ago we enjoyed it I mean it's just an escapist summer
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.040]  entertainment my family and I started listening to the original Jurassic Park
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.960]  book on audio tape and it's interesting because it's got a lot more detail behind
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:58.560]  it one of the things that he does is to go into the whole idea of GMOs and the
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.920]  potential for abuse because you remember in the movie the very first one the
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.800]  Jeff Goldblum character says well just because you can do something doesn't
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.960]  mean you should so he talks a lot about the potential science of that and how
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.880]  they put it together but he also talks about some of the issues and I thought
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.000]  about that again when I saw this story a couple of days ago on info wars calm
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.320]  about this lamb that was genetically modified with jellyfish DNA and sold
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:32.240]  as meat in France they made this lamb they added jellyfish DNA so that the
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:40.000]  lamb would glow in the dark they called it they call them green sheep okay so
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.560]  they add jellyfish fluorescent genes to the sheep so they will glow in the dark
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.200]  and that was one of the things that Michael Crichton addressed in Jurassic Park
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:55.160]  he said you know the biotechnology revolution differs in multiple aspects
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.760]  from past scientific transformations he says it's broad-based and of course
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.920]  we're going to see broad-based changes from AI from biotech you know
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.600]  genetic modification we're also going to see it from nanotechnology we have got
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.480]  several different technologies that are so broad-based and so deep it is going
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.720]  to fundamentally transform this world and many people are concerned that it's
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.720]  not going to be for the better people like Michael Crichton for example and
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.920]  when I say broad-based I mean that they're going to affect every industry
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.040]  it's not just going to be that you're going to have automation within the
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.400]  agricultural industry where you don't need as many farm workers but they're
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.280]  going to move on to other types of industries no it's going to affect every
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.800]  industry at the same time and it's going to affect it from top to bottom it's not
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:48.080]  going to just replace people who are doing manual menial repetitive tasks
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.080]  it's going to replace people who are managers people who are decision makers
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:58.000]  people who are in service industries it's going to affect every strata and
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.720]  it's going to affect every industry AI GMO nanotech all these different things
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.360]  but one of the things that he points out and this ties into this story about this
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  lamb that was made to glow in the dark with jellyfish DNA he says much of the
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.960]  research is thoughtless or frivolous this is Michael Crichton writing back
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.520]  decades ago in the original Jurassic Park novel he says efforts to engineer
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.960]  paler trout for better visibility in the stream or square trees for easier
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.800]  lumbering and injectable scent cells so that you'll always smell of your favorite
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.480]  perfume may seem like a joke but they're not indeed the fact that biotechnology
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.840]  can be applied to the industry is traditionally subject to the vagaries
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.960]  of fashion such as cosmetics and leisure activities heightens concern about
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:53.960]  the whimsical use of this powerful new technology the most disturbing is the
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.520]  fact that no watchdogs are found among scientists themselves it's remarkable
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.360]  that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also engaged in the commerce
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.160]  of biotechnology in the commerce of it you see there are no detached observers
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.640]  everyone has a stake and he says the commercialization of molecular biology
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:20.440]  is the most stunning ethical event in the history of science now keep that in
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:28.040]  mind and add to that the idea that virtually every new treatment for every
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:34.400]  disease is becoming a vaccine why because they have legal immunity if they
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.600]  give you something as a vaccine and it causes a problem they're covered by a
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.880]  special category they created the vaccine court to give them protection so if
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.240]  they call the vaccine they don't have the legal exposure that they do if they
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.840]  give you an antibiotic that fails or if they give you a different type of drug
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.800]  that has a negative side effect if they call the vaccine they're covered
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.840]  they're given special immunity in the United States and a large part of these
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:06.120]  new vaccines are genetically modified aspects and so we look at this and we
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.360]  think about how we have given and are giving through these mandatory vaccine
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:18.680]  bills we are given giving the power to big pharma and to the AMA to set how
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.080]  many of these we're going to take the frequency at which we're going to take
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.880]  them the timing at which we're going to take them we've already talked to
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.280]  multiple times to Michelle Roten with nurses against mandatory vaccines
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.120]  telling us that they know that they're going to harm premature low birth weight
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.960]  infants but they do it anyway they inject them anyway they say get ready
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.600]  we're gonna have to have intubation because we're going to give these babies
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.680]  the injection because they're two months old even though they're not really two
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.880]  months old they're pre-me's that's what we have to be concerned about say what
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.480]  this we're going to be right back with your call

[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.920]  news or the news website info wars.com because the companies I've been
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.440]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:19.200]  they should be so I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:24.160]  years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:29.280]  hdfirearms.com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people

[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.280]  go to Vincent in North Carolina Vincent you want to talk about global warming
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:43.760]  and what the Pope said about it this last week go ahead yes sir I had recently
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:50.480]  been in contact with one of the people at the LaRouche pack Alex has had Linda
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:58.200]  LaRouche on several times and they were just explaining that this is basically
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:04.120]  the you know the Vatican is advocating the fraud that we all have to be afraid
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.400]  of global warming but it really promotes the excuse to put in these
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:18.040]  controls yes across the board where you know people will be forced to cut back
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:24.560]  on on a lot of things they enjoy and namely jobs as well yes it's like we've
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:31.360]  seen with this TPP bill and that in my opinion would be a great way to start
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.160]  with the population reduction as you if you don't have it have an industrial
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:42.520]  base you can't support a population so well and that's not that's not just a
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.000]  wild extrapolation that you're making there either because the guy who's his
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.080]  chief science advisor one of his three spokesman when he released the encyclical
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:55.840]  as a guy named John Schellenhooper he's a German scientist with a German
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.560]  organization that works on climate change and he has said that we need to get
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:03.600]  rid of six billion people that's what the Pope's new appointment to the
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:09.320]  Pontifical Science Advisory Council has said he's for population control he's
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.480]  also for world government he's proposed that we have an earth
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.760]  constitution that we have a global council that we have a planetary court
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.520]  that is going to enforce all this everything is at the global level now
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.880]  the Pope didn't talk about those three aspects but he says that we need to have
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:32.000]  some kind is very vague about it some kind of global control of the economy
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.320]  of climate and of course it's not just about CO2 the Pope is not happy with a
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:42.720]  free market either and what we're seeing is not a free market we all know that we
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:46.400]  know that that is it's the multinational corporations that are driving this it's
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:53.720]  crony capitalism writ large they're the ones who are writing the trade agreements
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.020]  that are coming down the line that are really trade treaties it's not free
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:02.240]  trade it's not free market these few corporations are writing these laws in
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.200]  order to consolidate power to consolidate ownership of everything
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.640]  they're extending just in looking at copyrights they're extending their
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.720]  power to maintain copyrights indefinitely so that they can continue to
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.160]  own everything we see it in the kind of attitudes that we see from the director
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.080]  of uber who says that once we get self-driving cars they're going to become
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.200]  very cheap then private ownership goes away for everybody of course except for
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.640]  him he will have ownership of all of the cars and that's the mindset of all
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:40.160]  these global capitalists who are working the small click of people it's not mom and
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.080]  pop businesses and the free market that are the problem it's not even good size
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.920]  corporations that are the problem it's the multinational corporations that
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.560]  band together in these cartels and get control of governments and pass these
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.720]  treaties that we're about to see coming through thank you so much Vincent let's
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:07.800]  go to JT in Colorado JT yeah you know to follow up on on what the fellow from
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:16.600]  North Carolina just said they what we have is a coalition between government
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:27.560]  and and corporate corporations worldwide that are really just sucking the power
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.640]  and energy and money and everything out of the people it's a giant vampiric
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:41.360]  system yes and you know and they have control of the media so they can
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.200]  block the tour creating a problem which will bring a natural human reaction at
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:53.760]  least most people that aren't completely fluoride addled and because they do
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:01.800]  control the media and their masters of psychology they can set the solution a
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.040]  dipole solution like it'll be well you know we've got these people that are
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.120]  that are for us here and then we've got deniers over here and thereby maintain
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:20.000]  the you know the divide and conquer the division of the masses and well what
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.240]  they're creating essentially is the same thing that was on the Cyclops Island if
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.160]  you if you're into allegory at all and you want to read some Homer Homer's
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:38.600]  Odyssey the the section on polyphemus and they are the monster they are at the
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:45.200]  monolithic systematic socialist system yeah that will destroy all of us oh
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.800]  absolutely it's just amazing to me to see how they're trying to justify this
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.200]  even though their models have failed even though we haven't seen warming
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.920]  along the lines that they have predicted even though we haven't seen an
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.520]  increase in humidity even though they are keeping their data that they use to
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.560]  feed into their failed models even though they won't release that data that's
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:07.440]  why we had climate gate one we had climate gate two I was part of an
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.920]  organization tried to get information out of the University of Virginia
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.840]  regarding Michael Mann's correspondence so this is all stuff that was paid for
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:19.480]  by the taxpayer he said it was private even though he was doing it on the
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:25.640]  university's time while he was at work and they were using the conclusions of
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:31.440]  their research to affect policy and so the public has a right to know that but
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.080]  we saw the same kind of treatment there that we saw with lowest learners emails
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.760]  the first they said well we don't have them anymore then the Sierra Club came
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.280]  in and asked for some of their information and they gave it to them at
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.520]  that point the Attorney General said wait a minute you just lied to us you
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.840]  had told us that you didn't have that information oh well we just happened to
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:55.800]  find it you know that same type of thing that we saw with the IRS so it's it's a
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.920]  technique that they're using to try to establish control over everyone and over
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.360]  everything and they can establish that control much more effectively if they
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.160]  come after our energy usage than they can if they control our money but there's
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.360]  a course a financial dimension to that as well thank you so much JT and Colorado
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:20.280]  let's go to Ronnie and Austin go ahead Ronnie thank you sir I just wanted to
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.320]  agree with you wholeheartedly in the overwhelming nature of the problems that

[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.640]  overwhelmed at this point and I think that's their strategy and that's in my
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:39.400]  mind our key to our recovery and that one thing we can all agree on no matter
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:44.760]  what your main issue is is it's our Constitution that's under full-fledged attack yes

[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.000]  point out there's more than 400 of them there at info wars life.com that's
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.760]  info wars life.com now I want to go back to Ronnie and Austin he was talking
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.720]  about attacks on the Constitution we had to go to a commercial break Ronnie go
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:19.720]  ahead. Thank you sir the thing that the strategy in my mind is that all like-minded
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:24.560]  constitutional enthusiast libertarian leaning maybe open minded republicans
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.200]  and democrats and independents and others the time is now the assault is so
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:36.800]  immense and overwhelming that everybody can unite we can all come to our senses
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.000]  on this and so I'm thinking we should just take over the Constitution Party
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.520]  which exists at least here in Texas or it has here in Austin and that would be
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:51.480]  our I'm considering political vehicle to you know instead of trying to take over
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.000]  the republicans or even the libertarian party is pretty
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.400]  controlled from my viewpoint but if we could get on the Constitution Party
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.520]  because that's what we're talking about I think that's what we can all agree in
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.400]  and agree on it's under full fledged assault right now and that maybe that
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.400]  will inspire more people than usual that's what I'm hoping and praying I
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.880]  agree I mean I've been involved years ago I was involved in the libertarian
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.440]  party I just know how they control the ballot I mean it's one of the many
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.880]  corrupt aspects of our system they do not want to have and they've got plenty
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.680]  of mechanisms to make sure that they don't allow third parties to participate
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.520]  or independence for that matter so there's a lot of ballot access laws with a
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.720]  third party you wind up spending almost all of your time and money just trying
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.040]  to get on the ballot and then once you do they keep you out of the debates it's
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.080]  a very corrupt system I agree and I'm not really quite sure what to do about it
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.560]  I think we can start making some of those changes that badly need to be made if
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:56.960]  we don't focus too much on the big ticket races okay don't focus all your
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:02.160]  efforts on president president really isn't gonna have much of an issue much
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.120]  of a change that they're going to be able to make because we have such an
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.880]  entrenched bureaucracy what we need to do is we need to focus I think at the
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.040]  local level if we got some honest people in at the local level they'd be able to
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:17.520]  do some things like changed ballot access they'd be able to do things like
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.320]  block overreach from the federal government they would be able to do
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.200]  things like get people to understand and and make it easier to use jury
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.800]  nullification we need to start thinking locally we need to start thinking how we
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.840]  as individuals can make a difference instead of thinking about how we're
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:39.520]  going to get someone who is going to be our champion to go up to Washington like
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:45.000]  mr. Smith goes to Washington and single-handedly stop this massive cancer
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.720]  that we have up there we need to find a way to to block that cancer and then cut
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.480]  it out of our lives and that has to be done at the local level I think that's
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.320]  where we're really going to see change happen so yeah I agree with you we need
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:01.640]  to all get involved I think people left and right need to really understand what's
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:06.840]  going on with these trade agreements what a total screw job they are how they
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.920]  are going to be coming out as many people on the left I think understand it
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.800]  because they see the impact on health on medicine on jobs people on the
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:19.560]  conservative side people who typically work with the Republicans look at this
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.880]  and they just see free trade that's what they're being told and they don't see
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.120]  those issues they don't understand this is also going to be used for gun
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.080]  control it'll be used for immigration it'll be used for a variety of things
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.320]  but we're no matter where you are on these issues you should be appalled at
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:40.000]  the fact that this is a treaty that's being has been written over years by
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.920]  corporate lobbyists that the public is not allowed to see and putting a gag
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:49.200]  order on the congressman and most of them could care less to even go look at
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.400]  it because they've been told how to vote they don't need to know what's in it
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.360]  they're going to do what their corporate masters tell them to do any other
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:01.600]  comments Ronnie before we move on yeah I think we just need the legalized
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:10.320]  freedom on that and like you said just facing reality and going forward just
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:15.120]  don't let don't be discouraged by the overwhelming nature I think that's part
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.520]  of their strategy exactly exactly and I think thank you so much Ronnie and I
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.120]  think one of the things that they do one of the things that makes me think that
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.600]  our success is going to be at the local level is because whenever we would get
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.880]  ballot access as a third party they would always make retention dependent
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:36.440]  upon getting a large percentage of the vote either for governor or president
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.920]  and that would cause us to do two things it would cause us to focus all of our
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.960]  money and all of our effort to getting on the ballot and then it would cause us
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.160]  to focus on the most unwinnable races but we also need to understand that once
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.360]  we get somebody elected president even if it is somebody who's good they're not
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.200]  going to be able to do nearly as much to stop the out of control bureaucracies
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.360]  that basically are their own little petty kingdoms out there with their own
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.640]  legislation that they write their own police force their own courts they're
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.840]  their own little governments coming at us individually all at once okay they
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.000]  have they have created swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  their substance and the way we need to stop that is with nullification at the
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.240]  state level standing on due process and other things thank you let's go to Gary
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:31.360]  and Pennsylvania Gary go ahead hi thank you thank you Mr. Knight so thinking
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.280]  about like the collapse in Greece and well it's not really collapse yet but in
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.920]  the Euro and everything for those of you I'm sure David does but for those of you
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.160]  don't know the Greek Council is recommending that starting Tuesday there's
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:45.800]  going to be a 60 Euro limit on ATM withdrawals from the bank so I mean like
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.320]  like Alex and many of us have been feeling I think that you know something
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.840]  is definitely going on something that's unprecedented we all feel if
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:57.440]  something's just wrong so my question to David is is this going to cause the
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:01.400]  three things it's going to cause some fast domino or ripple effect for the
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.320]  rest of the world including like the US China Russia this possibly part of the
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.200]  reason for J. Helm on is this like all tied in together or what do you think
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.720]  well we do know that our government has been looking at ways to do currency
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:18.000]  control I mean we've had we've had a lot of economists here they're very highly
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.720]  placed with the largest banks as well as with government talking about the need
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.920]  for eliminating cash the need for having currency control so they're concerned
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:31.040]  about the very same thing happening here just not necessarily at this time but I
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.240]  think it's something that we all need to look at I think that when you see the
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.280]  preparations that are being made by the banks the preparations are being made
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:41.640]  by the governments when you see all of this you understand as well as when we
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:45.320]  talked to Michael Snyder if you remember it was last I think it was last
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.480]  Thursday I interviewed him and he said he's never seen so many different people
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.480]  predicting an economic collapse and so from so many different perspectives
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.080]  different models that they had people from all different types of disciplines
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.400]  looking at all this concern that there's going to be some kind of economic
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:08.000]  collapse I know that our government is I think that's what has been behind this
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.320]  build-up of military equipment with the police forces I think it's what's
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:18.760]  behind Jade Helm Jade Helm is tied in very closely what the special forces are
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.320]  doing to geospatial intelligence we look at what's happening with a massive
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.600]  surveillance from the government that is all tied together with special forces
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.760]  its military its surveillance the NSA the CIA as well as law enforcement they are
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  all working together to put this massive surveillance grid in place and of
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.080]  course mapping it on mapping what they know about you onto a map is a big
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.600]  part of it and as one of the people selling this for IBM said the ultimate
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:51.280]  biometric is your space time and travel data that's your meta tags of course we
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.320]  were told that didn't matter say with us going to be right back we're going to
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  talk to Chris in South Bend next then Wallace and Neozarks and Zack in
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:06.320]  Wisconsin say with us who do you prefer Barack Obama or George W Bush well if
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.880]  you haven't figured it out by now these guys are corporate spokesmen they're
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.680]  not leaders I mean they both started illegal wars hell they both tortured
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.160]  people they bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you they
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:25.160]  both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.440]  gonna take I mean what will it take to finally wake you up think about it if
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.640]  Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:39.560]  Republican one of them would end up leading our country its politics
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:44.960]  incorporated and your choice between the two parties is a myth because in

[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:35.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight and this final segment
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.640]  we're trying to get through as many calls as we can we're gonna go to Chris
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:43.600]  Wallace Zach Francis Mad Wilt I think it's coming on there as well let's go to
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:50.480]  Chris and Southman Chris greetings mr. Knight hey how you doing what's up what
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:57.080]  you want to talk about first I just did a liver cleanse just got done yesterday
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.840]  first two quick lightning points on the if you take on about the gay marriage
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.760]  Supreme Court decision I mean that's fine and now can we legalize guns in all
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:11.040]  states and be if someone wants you're talking about big farmer earlier there's
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.840]  a movie out there back that was made in 2006 and it shows the corruption of big
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:19.760]  pharma that's using Africa's a big giant guinea pig called a constant gardener
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:23.520]  and it and it starts where I'll find that's a great movie this audience would
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:28.520]  absolutely love it's called a constant gardener constant constant gardener okay
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:31.120]  I haven't seen that I'm gonna write that down because I want to see that yeah
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.160]  good I just watched it a couple nights ago because I'm on this liver cleanse so
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:39.280]  it's like when I get back home it's like you know you got a you know really good
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.480]  dinner and all this and it's just something it's it's like two hours and
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.280]  ten minutes or something so it's a really good this audience but that's
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:51.120]  we love that it goes let's go in and yeah yeah so it's something you can watch
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.880]  while you do the liver cleanse there you go I was gonna do that myself but they
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:58.880]  they sold out of it if people want to get on the waiting list they can still
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.520]  sign up for that we'll give them an email when when liver cleanse comes back in
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:07.560]  but it is sold out at the moment but is that working out good for you sure I
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:14.680]  mean I started on Tuesday and I'll tell you I lost about five pounds in five
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:21.320]  days and I was able to work out while I was doing it pretty good I mean I was
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:25.960]  innate I was limited to what I was able to do working out I was able to do my
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:30.600]  routine just fine I highly recommend it a lot easier to do this if you do this
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.640]  along with a friend or family member because you can kind of text communicate
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.280]  back and forth hey how are you feeling right now what did you have for lunch or
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.040]  different breakfast would you ever lunch tomorrow you know what I mean yeah
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.320]  that's true it's always hard to do that on your own I always prefer if I'm gonna
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.600]  do something in terms of a change of diet or change of exercise regime it's
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.080]  always much easier I do it with my wife or with the family something like that
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.680]  that's that's a good good point well thank you so much Chris that's a good
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:02.800]  tip on a movie and certainly we have seen not only Africa but Africans in
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.240]  America look at the Tuskegee Institute that's one of the reasons that we push
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.040]  so hard and say we cannot give up informed consent because we don't want
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:14.720]  to see people experimented on for the quote-unquote greater good that's what
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:18.400]  happened in the Nazi war criminal camps right but of course we brought those
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.240]  guys over to the United States after the war as part of Operation Paperclip we
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.800]  put them in charge of our biochemical and bio weapons labs okay and now we've
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.920]  got labs that are working on gain of function I mean you talk about Jurassic
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:36.480]  Park and biotechnology that's out of control I mean these people are bringing
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:43.600]  in dangerous diseases that are not native to the US they are intensifying
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.040]  them in the sense that they are what they call gain of function is making
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:52.200]  them easier to catch and harder to kill what a great idea but of course that's
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:56.040]  bio weapons technology and that's a big part of the experimentation that's
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:01.040]  going on in Africa it's a bio weapons John Rappaport has pointed that out how
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:07.800]  the same group that was involved with the Tuskegee Institute experiments was
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:13.360]  over there in Africa when Ebola broke out and the government there was very
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.120]  suspicious and Sierra Leone and told them get out of here they were concerned
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:21.560]  that they were the source of it whether that it leaked out unintentionally or
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.960]  whether it was put out intentionally let's go to Wallace and the Ozarks go
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:34.480]  ahead Wallace okay I think Wallace is gone let's go to Zach in Wisconsin
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:40.000]  hey David hey I just graduated from college recently with a degree in
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.520]  environmental engineering and the stuff I was being taught about agenda 21 and
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:48.360]  climate change was just garbage I mean they're trying to shut down all these
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.720]  coal power plants but people don't realize that the technology we have on
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:56.120]  them today with these electrostatic precipitators and these wet scrubbers
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:00.560]  they do a really good job about filtering all this VOC and all this
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.880]  other garbage out of them and then they're being opened right on the
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:08.720]  Mexico border right on in China and that pollution will come to the United
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:11.720]  States it doesn't just stay in that country the winds will pick it up and
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.360]  bring it here and people don't realize that this is a global thing and we have
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.000]  coal to last us a couple hundred years at least at the rate we're using it but
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.160]  it's just being shut down or moving towards more ridiculous forms of energy
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:29.960]  and I don't know I just think this needs to stop and we need to get back to an
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.320]  industrial powerhouse that the United States was known for in the early 20th
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.720]  century absolutely you know I don't know if you heard when I was talking about
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:41.720]  this magazine I have from 1979 it was let's see it's Newsweek their special
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:44.040]  report on energy and they had a chart there and they were telling us that we
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:48.960]  had 8.7 years left of oil we had 10.7 years left of gas natural gas and we
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:59.040]  had 665 666.5 years left of coal I mean I when I saw that 36 years ago I went
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:02.360]  hysterical laughing and I've saved this magazine you can see it is yellowed
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:06.120]  right now but it's exactly that same kind of absurdity you're
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:10.960]  talking about Zach when they tell us that global warming is a problem but
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:17.240]  they give carte blanche to China to other to India or to Mexico to build power
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:21.440]  plants that don't have the same kind of controls that they have here just as you
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:26.040]  pointed out they have scrubbers and other things that can burn this very
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:30.600]  cleanly but they stop that in the United States and then they allow other
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:36.840]  countries to build older style of not reactors but generators that are going
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.480]  to have that pollution is absolutely amazing to me the hypocrisy but of
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:45.160]  course it's simply about controls back when I was talking about this I pointed
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.200]  out that their solution was the same thing that we're seeing right now and
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:54.400]  that is more tax more rationing more federal control did you call the the
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.480]  reports that we did about the EPA Zach when they were pushing this fine
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:02.840]  particulate matter and they were doing human testing on people in North
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.040]  Carolina later did it in California do you remember that where they're hooking
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.040]  them up directly to diesel exhaust and seeing if they could get a reaction from
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:14.600]  them do you remember that it was just ridiculous I mean I tried to tell my
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:18.160]  sister who's a doctor about that she's like oh no they can't do human testing
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.040]  on that kind of stuff we're like no this is the report right here they're doing
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.600]  this kind of stuff I mean it'd be leading the the test and everything to get
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.040]  the processing control that they want to happen and it's just ridiculous yeah
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:37.200]  they were exposing people to 70 times thing of 72 times what they said was the
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.600]  upper limit that would cause death that's what Lisa Jackson the EPA director
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.560]  was telling Congress at the time she said more people are dying from fine
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:49.360]  particulate matter than are dying from cancer so we need to shut down all power
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:53.520]  generation and in order to push that policy through they were hooking people
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.240]  up to diesel exhaust they were running ads looking for people who had respiratory
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:02.880]  issues who had heart issues and they were deliberately trying to give these
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.920]  people health issues so they could justify upping the ante absolute insanity
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.440]  thank you so much Zach let's go to Francis in New York Francis go ahead
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:16.640]  hey mr. Knight how are you pleasure to talk to you I should talk to you I have a
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.840]  question to ask you did you ever hear of a document that was published in on
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:25.920]  September 17 1973 it's called the regionalized and adaptive model of
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.160]  global world system and that document states that they have to create ten
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:35.600]  kingdoms around the world and I believe that the the the trends you know that
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.720]  thing that they passed this past week and with the TPP you think that they can
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:46.480]  actually go get that through with the TPP on the North American Union was hard
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:51.600]  to say I mean when I look at these the TPP and the TTIP that's a
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.480]  Trans-Pacific Transatlantic Partnerships and we look at what happened with the
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.440]  North American free trade agreement that we all said at the time was North
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:03.640]  American Union but everybody poo pooed that idea we had David Petraeus saying
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:08.120]  last year look we were past America we now have North America meaning North
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.480]  American Union he said we're 20 years and in Africa we've got the three
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:18.320]  countries together when I look at it I see the blueprint of Brzezinski who set
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.680]  up the trilateral Commission remember he had the the book between two ages that
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:26.720]  he wrote in 1970 and then they created the trilateral Commission in 1973 David
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.680]  Rockefeller paid for it Brzezinski was the first president of it he
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:36.880]  essentially saw three regional consolidations economically and then
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:40.640]  eventually politically and then joining those together into a world
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.720]  government we are essentially the spine America is the spine of this they're
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:49.880]  adding the Asian wing as well as the European wing to it at the same time so
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:54.600]  it looks to me like that is there the way that they're consolidating all this
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.080]  the steps that they're taking and of course it begins with a trade union it
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.200]  begins with an economic union and then as we're seeing now with this situation
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:07.360]  in Greece they create economic crises and then use that to take political
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.640]  sovereignty they made it clear that that was their their program all along and
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.040]  of course we see that with the Bilderberg group we see that with the
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:17.480]  trilateral Commission we see it with the Club of Rome as you're pointing out
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.520]  with the Council on Foreign Relations these are all different groups there's
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.240]  others as well where they get together they put these plans together and this
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.040]  is something that has been out there for a very long time it's not any secret but
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:34.360]  now it's coming to pass and that's the thing that concerns all of us well
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.280]  that's it for our program today thank you so much Francis sorry I couldn't get to
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:44.200]  you a mad wit and Detroit join us tomorrow at 11 central for the Alex
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:58:01.200]  Jones radio show
