[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.960 --> 00:19.520]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.520 --> 00:23.560]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.560 --> 00:30.480]  well my friends this is going to be a completely a jam-packed dynamic
[00:30.480 --> 00:42.040]  extremely informative radio broadcast day and we're gonna be live here for the
[00:42.040 --> 00:49.560]  next four hours coming up in an hour and a half we begin our gallery of
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.040]  informative guest our marathon of guest Charlie Skelton London Guardian
[00:54.040 --> 01:02.680]  reporter got some major scoops at the Bilderberg group and he he was on the
[01:02.680 --> 01:09.880]  show a couple days ago and he said oh well I can't tell you until it's in the
[01:09.880 --> 01:16.680]  Guardian and boy I wish he would have told me because it was about me that's
[01:16.680 --> 01:19.720]  right he was inside the hotel they were meeting as they were kicking him out
[01:19.720 --> 01:23.920]  they were the last guest security was called on him but before that they
[01:23.920 --> 01:29.520]  heard Bilderberg organizers talking about how dangerous and scary I was in
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.960]  2006 bullhorning them and discussing how that's why they've got to wreck the
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.160]  economy to basically make us all poor slaves so no one even has money to
[01:39.160 --> 01:45.720]  travel to confront them amazing information but I got Skelton coming on
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.240]  I'm gonna say look Skelton this is big news tell us what else has happened of
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.240]  course he got arrested last year and did talk about that and it made a separate
[01:55.240 --> 02:00.440]  newspapers in Greece Bob Chapman with his weekly visit pops and then Jim Tucker
[02:00.440 --> 02:05.480]  who does have some intel for us today and the Nigel Farage who survived the
[02:05.480 --> 02:11.080]  plane crash but lost the election for the key speakership post in the British
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.720]  Parliament still a member of the European Union member of Parliament and
[02:16.720 --> 02:24.600]  he'll be joining us one of his first interviews since the plane crash so that
[02:24.600 --> 02:31.120]  should be quite informative as well you know I know that the global government
[02:31.120 --> 02:35.840]  is reducing our population I know they're changing our DNA I know they are
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.080]  poisoning our water and food supplies I have their own documents but I got
[02:41.080 --> 02:45.560]  another big study yesterday and meant to go over but didn't but I'm gonna cover
[02:45.560 --> 02:50.560]  today top Russian scientists just confirm what British and US scientists and
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.720]  Australian scientists and Chinese scientists have shown and I've had
[02:54.720 --> 02:58.240]  countless genetic engineers on the broadcast they were making millions of
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.040]  dollars a year they would find that their long-leaf potato or their corn or
[03:03.040 --> 03:09.080]  whatever it was soybeans was sterilizing and killing guinea pigs rats lab mice you
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.520]  name it in every case and some of these meetings that they were told don't worry
[03:14.520 --> 03:20.080]  about there's too many people we're approving this and this new study shows
[03:20.080 --> 03:27.720]  how it multi-generationally sterilizes oh it doesn't just sterilize you it's
[03:27.720 --> 03:34.400]  gonna sterilize your children and so just remember 20 years from now when
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.800]  when when when literally almost everyone to sterilize already large portions have
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.280]  reduced fertility or sterilized but when just almost no one can have kids just
[03:43.280 --> 03:50.160]  remember you heard it here first okay you've been hit with a biological weapon
[03:50.160 --> 04:05.160]  and so I'm going to cover that today just remember that you were warned just
[04:05.160 --> 04:11.720]  remember that we have the documentation of the evidence and and I want to be
[04:11.720 --> 04:18.760]  clear my chemtrail film coming out probably in October two years in the
[04:18.760 --> 04:26.000]  making a part of it's about chemtrails two hour film part of it's about chemtrails
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.520]  but it's the bigger story okay you think in-game expose eugenics well this is
[04:32.520 --> 04:37.680]  the mother load and this is the only issue there's nothing else I listen to
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.240]  grown men driving in on sports radio calling in really upset and talking
[04:43.240 --> 04:50.280]  about baseball and then obsessing over it and I mean it's just hey boys your
[04:50.280 --> 04:53.440]  kids aren't gonna be able to have children comprende you're not gonna have
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.040]  grandchildren I mean you understand that's a bigger deal than your stupid
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.400]  baseball team right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.400 --> 05:06.840]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:06.840 --> 05:10.840]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:10.840 --> 05:14.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:14.760 --> 05:18.760]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:18.760 --> 05:23.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.160]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.760]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.120 --> 05:42.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.240 --> 05:45.920]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[08:19.920 --> 08:23.520]  alex jones
[08:27.040 --> 08:34.040]  okay here are the vinyl stacks of news that will be covered today stocks open
[08:34.040 --> 08:40.000]  lower after jobs report and of course it's now being confirmed by the AP well
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.760]  we reported three weeks ago when insiders inside the census went public
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.680]  every month they lay off hundreds of thousands of people that have been
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.120]  hired for the census and then rehire them the press is reporting that more
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.240]  than half of the employees are quote considered to be temporary or part-time
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.480]  and so it is all a statistical manipulation so so even when you hear the
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.520]  numbers are bad those are cooked as well that's coming up also North Korean
[09:09.520 --> 09:19.040]  diplomat war may break out at any moment and I saw a commenter in this story
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.880]  saying well yeah little green men could land at any time no North Korea is still
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.080]  at war with South Korea they've had an armistice or a ceasefire for over 50
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.240]  years and this is you know most experts we've talked to you say this is one of
[09:32.240 --> 09:37.280]  the biggest escalations in that 50-plus year ceasefire history okay so if
[09:37.280 --> 09:42.080]  anybody goes over anyone else's border or if any ships cross into disputed
[09:42.080 --> 09:47.600]  areas there could be a giant war starting anytime we're not saying that's
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.120]  happening or is going to happen but to say as the commenter did that oh yeah
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.160]  and it's you know little green men could land because the headline is North
[09:57.160 --> 10:00.960]  Korean diplomat war may break out any moment and the commenter said yeah and
[10:00.960 --> 10:06.680]  little green men may land any moment no Korea is a real place Asia is a real
[10:06.680 --> 10:11.800]  place nuclear weapons are real the Korean war or conflict police action was
[10:11.800 --> 10:16.160]  real killing tens of thousands of us soldiers hundreds of thousands of

[10:54.840 --> 10:58.640]  and reduced fertility bare minimum Israel the fact that they are spraying
[10:58.640 --> 11:04.120]  barium salts and aluminum dioxide and that worldwide soil samples from just a
[11:04.120 --> 11:08.360]  decade ago show that in most areas there's over a hundred fold increase in
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.520]  aluminum many areas a thousand fold aluminum we have government documents
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.880]  that are public where they don't even hide it that they are adding these
[11:16.880 --> 11:20.720]  mixtures to the jet fuel so it's compartmentalized so even the airlines

[14:01.400 --> 14:05.880]  that's the London Guardian and guess who they were talking about London Guardian
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.960]  reporter on record right before they call security on him and his wife
[14:11.960 --> 14:19.240]  throwing them out of the luxury hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona how do you
[14:19.240 --> 14:27.600]  pronounce that town sedges sedges and the he overhears them going yes that Alex
[14:27.600 --> 14:32.760]  Jones was here very scary I can't believe it did the rabble attack no he
[14:32.760 --> 14:36.760]  bullhorned is very frightening that's the problem they've got too much money we've
[14:36.760 --> 14:40.920]  got to shut off the funds to them so they're unable to travel soon enough our
[14:40.920 --> 14:47.680]  program will be in place don't you worry I mean they're publicly all over the
[14:47.680 --> 14:53.120]  news saying it's excellent that the carbon restrictions are and the economy
[14:53.120 --> 14:58.320]  and ploding is just is stopping mobility and mobility of human activity we'll
[14:58.320 --> 15:04.560]  have these rabble exactly where we want them very soon our goal is to destroy
[15:04.560 --> 15:11.480]  industrial society and there's nothing you can do to stop our GMO's
[15:11.480 --> 15:16.480]  Sterilins it's way of all these big environmental groups supporting it to
[15:16.480 --> 15:22.080]  stop climate change we've got to have GMO probably they use less water water
[15:22.080 --> 15:30.320]  it's not renewable course it is oh my god I just can't handle it anymore I
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.040]  mean I know every day their murders I know every day their killers and then a
[15:34.040 --> 15:37.960]  London Guardian reporter is in the hotel is security scurrying around before
[15:37.960 --> 15:43.360]  they shot it I've been in a Bilderberg hotel when they're meeting I mean
[15:43.360 --> 15:46.720]  literally I was still in the hotel room they were knocking on doors later when
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.040]  they get out we got video is what appeared to be the leader of Spain arrived
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.720]  and they played the national anthem I'm filming out the window at the entrance
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.520]  at the Marriott Chantilly Virginia and they and they play the national anthem
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.840]  of Spain as an armored limousine pulls in then as we left the hotel we had
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.200]  shaved head special forces type troops in suits trying to block us in and with
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.320]  trucks and then following us and making eight turns with us then later we saw
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.240]  the vehicle back on the property and then the New York Times makes jokes and
[16:22.240 --> 16:28.520]  says Mr. Jones was basically having a schizophrenic breakdown in a hotel park
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.640]  imagining there were men in sunglasses admitted Bilderberg group admitted
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.200]  Bilderberg group meeting and the New York Times and others ran pieces saying I
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.720]  am just a complete full-blown absolute complete lunatic running around
[16:43.720 --> 16:50.760]  foaming at the mouth at a deserted hotel that's how dumb they think you are
[16:50.760 --> 16:57.000]  that's how cattle-like and stupid they think you are
[16:58.200 --> 17:04.480]  like I was stumbling over my words just now even describing it because it's
[17:04.480 --> 17:09.200]  just so amazing to me how evil they are and those New York Times reporters their
[17:09.200 --> 17:14.480]  kids are drinking sodium fluoride their kids are eating GMO food almost all of
[17:14.480 --> 17:17.520]  their children are going to be sterile their grandchildren the study show will
[17:17.520 --> 17:21.560]  be completely sterile maybe one out of a hundred will be able to have children by
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.440]  then every trend shows and they just don't care they're like good I like the
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.360]  system I can watch a football game and I don't care if my family lines over I
[17:29.360 --> 17:35.040]  don't care I'm being killed like a cockroach I love it I like it and cops

[18:09.200 --> 18:13.320]  good I choose to join with the system I choose to run into the pit and be shot
[18:13.320 --> 18:16.800]  in the back of the head because that's the logical extension you know people
[18:16.800 --> 18:23.840]  always marvel at those famous videos in Poland films 16 millimeter 8 millimeter
[18:23.840 --> 18:33.120]  shot by the Germans in Poland in Germany in Czechoslovakia in Russia and they
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.800]  would just round up the men round up the women round up the children march them
[18:36.800 --> 18:40.800]  into pits and shoot them in the back of the head and and then they would have
[18:40.800 --> 18:43.680]  the next line and they would politely hold their hat and bow to the German
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.800]  soldiers and they would they would scurry forward lovingly oh thank you so
[18:47.800 --> 18:52.240]  let me let me curtsy to you and let me run into the pit and be shot in the back
[18:52.240 --> 18:58.120]  of the head that's all you are America you drink the fluoride every day you eat
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.720]  the GMO food you're running into the pit and you thank the government and you
[19:02.720 --> 19:09.840]  appreciate it well good for you then good for you at least I'm not a timid
[19:09.840 --> 19:18.360]  domesticated castrated soul sucked zombie I'm going down speaking out
[19:18.360 --> 19:24.240]  against it I'm going down trying to rally my fellow humans I'm going down
[19:24.240 --> 19:30.600]  telling the truth why do you think Bilderberg so scared of the media and
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.560]  so scared of citizens why do you think when G20 meets they call in the regular
[19:34.560 --> 19:37.800]  army and lock the entire cities down and have martial law that's what they had a
[19:37.800 --> 19:41.920]  G20 why do you think they do that because they know their criminals they
[19:41.920 --> 19:49.560]  know they're evil they have guilt they know that they deserve to be punished
[19:49.560 --> 19:55.520]  severely for their murderous eugenics operations they're scared of you there's
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.440]  like a robber in your house is scared they know we'll be back with how they're

[23:58.080 --> 24:01.080]  right now
[24:13.720 --> 24:20.160]  front-ports now you have to understand I see articles like this every day
[24:20.160 --> 24:27.600]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds I have interviewed over the years genetic
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.760]  engineers in one case one of the most highly-paid genetic engineers in
[24:31.760 --> 24:37.280]  England he was dealing with the long-leaf potato and they were getting
[24:37.280 --> 24:41.440]  ready to approve it but they found in the studies it was sterilizing within
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.240]  the first generation more than half of the guinea pigs similar results with
[24:46.240 --> 24:53.440]  rats and mice and it was also causing after utero deformities and in folks
[24:53.440 --> 25:00.520]  of deformity after development the wound is very very rare that's just something
[25:00.520 --> 25:04.080]  out of a science fiction movie where people mutate after they're born but
[25:04.080 --> 25:09.360]  no it was causing mutations after they after the rodents were born the only
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.600]  other type of course mutation there is after birth that would be called
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.000]  somewhat natural is cancer that's when cells of course you know start
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.800]  replicating out of control and reprogramming surrounding tissues and
[25:23.800 --> 25:30.400]  the testifies but and it was cancers as well I mean I've literally seen hundreds
[25:30.400 --> 25:34.080]  of these studies and I've talked to other genetic engineers on record and
[25:34.080 --> 25:37.080]  they would complain and they would be told by executives don't worry there's
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.160]  too many people anyway and see they can go in and change a tomato to make it
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.720]  last longer it tastes better they can go in and make a salmon with insect
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.280]  genes last longer have a bit better resistance to disease but while they're
[25:51.280 --> 25:56.640]  at it they can change other genetics and whether it's genetically engineered pigs
[25:56.640 --> 26:06.080]  cows salmon tilapia they've got genetically engineered shrimp spiders that
[26:06.080 --> 26:11.120]  produce body armor it doesn't matter but but when it's a food crop whether it's
[26:11.120 --> 26:18.520]  corn wheat soybeans all the major crops in every case every major seedline every
[26:18.520 --> 26:26.520]  major study it's causing reduced fertility they're doing this by design
[26:26.520 --> 26:31.440]  they're going in and manipulating it knowing that only other top genetic
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.520]  engineers can can can go in and discover it and then do their own studies to find
[26:36.520 --> 26:40.160]  out what had been done so it's the perfect crime it's so high-tech this is
[26:40.160 --> 26:49.600]  super high-tech crime that's being committed this is 21st-century mass crime
[26:53.280 --> 27:00.280]  and so then the organic consumers associations got a report so does PSFK
[27:00.280 --> 27:05.040]  research link to that we modified food to long-term sterility and the Institute
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.280]  for Responsible Technology and they link to the mainline Russian studies but
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.840]  again this is on top of all the other studies Dr. Markola is also reporting on
[27:14.840 --> 27:22.000]  it and we're gonna get researcher Jeffrey R. Smith who's literally written the
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.280]  textbooks by the way that we sell with all the government documentation they're
[27:25.280 --> 27:31.040]  written like textbooks at infowars.com research links genetically modified
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.600]  food to long-term sterility and see this is what the other studies show with
[27:35.600 --> 27:43.240]  mercury-based vaccines they do reduce your fertility but generationally mercury
[27:43.240 --> 27:46.840]  especially when it's put directly into the blood the type that goes through you
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.320]  know in food is most of its bound and it doesn't have that same effect when you
[27:50.320 --> 27:56.480]  eat mercury still not good for you and it directly generationally causes infertility
[27:56.480 --> 28:01.960]  retardation lower IQ and long and shorter lives now now the media will
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.680]  argue we're living longer no we're not you can go look at the statistics on
[28:06.680 --> 28:13.080]  infant death but it go to any cemetery even before the 50s you'll notice that
[28:13.080 --> 28:18.720]  about half the people in there are dead kids and if you go back to the 19th
[28:18.720 --> 28:24.920]  hundreds the 1800s 1700s more than half are small children most of them under the
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.840]  age of three most people died most most families lost around half their
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.040]  children in some areas in higher educated you know better health better
[28:34.040 --> 28:39.320]  conditions only 20 30% depending on the end but I've got family cemeteries in
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.360]  each Texas we don't own most the land anymore but we'll get permission every
[28:44.360 --> 28:49.760]  once in a while to you know hike over a fence off the highway and then on
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.960]  somebody else's ranch and see family cemeteries I've been to quite a few of
[28:53.960 --> 29:02.000]  them Joneses Johnson's Browns and others and it's just mainly dead kids just
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.440]  everywhere just three years old two years old one-year-old five years old
[29:06.440 --> 29:13.040]  it's just those old cemeteries just full of kids and there's a few you know
[29:13.040 --> 29:24.840]  slash Johnson you know killed by Indians it's amazing but back next door by
[29:24.840 --> 29:34.640]  next door it's out in the middle of a field there's a another cemetery but
[29:34.640 --> 29:38.760]  without gravestones of an early Spanish settlement that people pulled out of
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.880]  some type of plague at it and if you dig around over there's little skulls and
[29:43.880 --> 29:47.480]  little bones and mainly kids all right folks I'm gonna come back and finish up
[29:47.480 --> 29:50.440]  with how they're murdering you and your family right now with slow-kill weapons
[29:50.440 --> 29:59.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[31:17.300 --> 31:22.280]  pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[31:22.280 --> 31:27.520]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[31:27.520 --> 31:32.160]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[31:32.160 --> 31:36.400]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can now produce pure and
[31:36.400 --> 31:41.160]  endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator very easy to follow
[31:41.160 --> 31:46.000]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[31:51.640 --> 31:57.920]  the Silver Lungs Generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[31:57.920 --> 32:02.720]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[32:02.720 --> 32:07.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[32:07.040 --> 32:11.200]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[32:11.200 --> 32:15.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[32:15.240 --> 32:19.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[32:19.120 --> 32:23.240]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[32:23.240 --> 32:27.560]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[32:27.560 --> 32:31.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[32:31.880 --> 32:35.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[32:35.600 --> 32:39.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[32:39.800 --> 32:43.160]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[32:43.160 --> 32:49.320]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[32:49.320 --> 32:53.840]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go
[32:53.840 --> 33:00.720]  to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[33:00.720 --> 33:27.400]  you see we were an agrarian slash industrial society the wealthiest in
[33:27.400 --> 33:31.480]  the world here in the United States the light of the planet the apple of the
[33:31.480 --> 33:35.560]  world's eye the greatest example of freedom and liberty and private
[33:35.560 --> 33:40.600]  property and family who aren't perfect but you know the whole world foreign
[33:40.600 --> 33:46.240]  historians and researchers from Asia Europe Africa Latin America they all
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.080]  marveled at our republic now the whole world hates us because we're used as an
[33:52.080 --> 33:57.200]  engine of evil and we're brainwashed we're manipulated and we were eaves into
[33:57.200 --> 34:01.560]  television and movies and culture and we're the good guys and we can do no
[34:01.560 --> 34:06.680]  wrong and everything's about having fun and enjoying yourself and not being
[34:06.680 --> 34:10.720]  involved in government and never mind how things work you know don't be
[34:10.720 --> 34:15.080]  informed don't be involved I've got a video clip of senator Jim DeMint
[34:15.080 --> 34:21.160]  pointing out what we've talked about a lot here the read the bills act that
[34:21.160 --> 34:27.320]  Ron Paul supported in Congress and DeMint talks about the Senate 94% are
[34:27.320 --> 34:31.480]  never even looked at special interest just bring them in and they pass them
[34:31.480 --> 34:36.920]  and that's why they're gonna approve Elena Kagan who says ban guns and arrest
[34:36.920 --> 34:41.240]  anyone for their free speech that's just they don't care that's why they've
[34:41.240 --> 34:44.920]  stolen tens of trillions that you're gonna pay for in tax money and the
[34:44.920 --> 34:53.360]  Congress says where's the money and they say look we're not gonna tell you but I
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.080]  want to explain something to you I mean I mean I really want new listeners
[34:57.080 --> 34:59.560]  because we're on all these AM and FM stations out there we probably gained
[34:59.560 --> 35:04.240]  30 40 affiliates just the last five six months on top of the affiliates we had I
[35:04.240 --> 35:06.840]  mean I want to ask you something you're driving along your car for the first
[35:06.840 --> 35:10.480]  time you're tuned in you're like what is this lunatic talking about listen you
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.640]  know what I am a lunatic I'm gonna be honest with you compared to the general
[35:15.640 --> 35:20.120]  public I'm crazy just like if I teleported back to Nazi Germany 1943 and
[35:20.120 --> 35:24.440]  was in a big slave camp and I walked up to Germans and said this is wrong they'd
[35:24.440 --> 35:27.760]  say you're a lunatic locked this guy in irons and we're gonna torture him and
[35:27.760 --> 35:31.160]  find out who he's with just like I've told you if I teleported back a thousand
[35:31.160 --> 35:36.600]  years ago to the Aztec Kingdom and I walked up to a floating chalupa that's
[35:36.600 --> 35:44.800]  not a Mexican dish folks that's the name of their floating gardens and if I came
[35:44.800 --> 35:48.840]  up to one of their swamp gardens and I said listen you know you to sacrifice
[35:48.840 --> 35:53.400]  somebody today for your plants to grow you know the garden God the plant God
[35:53.400 --> 35:58.160]  the corn God doesn't need blood to grow corn they would they would arrest me
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.200]  they dragged me off and sacrificed me and say I was a lunatic so you know what
[36:01.200 --> 36:07.280]  I am a lunatic okay I am a lunatic because the general public is crazy
[36:07.280 --> 36:13.840]  but see under the definition of insanity you're normal I'm not okay I read
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.520]  government documents where they knowingly put poisons in the water under a
[36:18.520 --> 36:24.080]  ran corporation operation to sterilize your butt and to poison you and to
[36:24.080 --> 36:30.400]  reduce your fertility and to dumb you down and you know what I get angry I
[36:30.400 --> 36:39.040]  get upset about that and that is insane today reading legislation is seen as
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.760]  insane being involved I mean I've talked to so many adults are like man you're
[36:42.760 --> 36:52.160]  weird you're like informed and you read things and whoa that Alex Jones man he
[36:52.160 --> 36:57.200]  says there's a global government and they want to kill the majority of us
[36:57.200 --> 37:02.600]  well like we're all the dead people well they're being slowly killed with
[37:02.600 --> 37:15.600]  binary weapons soft kill stealth kill weapons and so it's done incrementally
[37:15.600 --> 37:18.080]  and the doctors are brainwashed and compartmentalized so they don't
[37:18.080 --> 37:21.800]  recognize what's happening and the cancer rates are up thousands of
[37:21.800 --> 37:26.600]  percentiles every other major disease is off the charts autism diabetes thousands
[37:26.600 --> 37:32.240]  percentile points up and from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 68 I mean the with
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.160]  autism this isn't a game
[37:40.960 --> 37:47.280]  one of the definitions of insanity is extreme folly senselessness fool
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.480]  hardiness of course that describes the general public completely insane but to
[37:51.480 --> 37:59.760]  the fool I am insane they're like man you know they don't have time to read the
[37:59.760 --> 38:06.800]  bills thousands a year the government cares about his man you're insane dude
[38:06.800 --> 38:14.880]  that Alex Jones he's insane dude like he's radical he believes people should
[38:14.880 --> 38:20.880]  be able to own guns he believes people should be able to own property he
[38:20.880 --> 38:27.400]  doesn't believe Florida it's good for your teeth or I'm gonna stop it but
[38:27.400 --> 38:31.120]  research links to that we modified food to long-term sterility I mean I see
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.600]  this is I've literally probably read 500 studies saying the same thing I mean
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.960]  it's gotta be approaching a thousand I've got US government document after
[38:42.960 --> 38:45.560]  US government doctor that I've just discovered in the last week working on
[38:45.560 --> 38:49.920]  the chem drill film I've been researching it for a course over a decade but
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.600]  working on the film for two years intensely but towards the end we do
[38:55.600 --> 38:58.520]  more more research everything just comes to a head and it's just I'm a lot the
[38:58.520 --> 39:02.720]  last day four or five new public government documents on US government
[39:02.720 --> 39:08.520]  websites saying yes we add chemicals to the jet fuel to have airlines disperse
[39:08.520 --> 39:12.120]  it and the public doesn't even know it's wonderful ha ha ha and the public such
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.720]  scum they won't even read this or care
[39:15.720 --> 39:25.520]  I mean it's all off the chart and I have to sit here and know this is going on
[39:25.520 --> 39:30.320]  and I know it and I can't even stop being lazy and pulling in and getting a
[39:30.320 --> 39:37.760]  hamburger that I know full wells GMO bun GMO fries took my kids in Sunday night
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.320]  then out fishing at the lake with my parents I'm going home pull into a
[39:42.320 --> 39:47.080]  burger place at 8 o'clock at night now by Lake Travis I go in I'm sitting there
[39:47.080 --> 39:52.160]  eating it and I can't even stop I can't even get fresh beef I know isn't GMO or
[39:52.160 --> 39:56.600]  find you know good buns and I do most the time but I still I'm just there
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.240]  basically assaulting my children and you know my kids can't have kids it's my
[40:01.240 --> 40:03.480]  fault
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.480]  you know I lived in a house and put fluoride filters in a couple years ago
[40:11.480 --> 40:18.960]  and then I moved and for a couple years I didn't I just was busy I didn't put a
[40:18.960 --> 40:22.840]  whole house fluoride treatment system in there was fluoride to catch all term
[40:22.840 --> 40:27.400]  for hundreds of chemicals they add on purpose on record and I let my kids
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.360]  bathe in it and shower in it and when they absorb just as much to the skin
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.240]  and breathe just as much as you do drinking it and then I've recently
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.440]  moved again in the last few months and I've got to get up off my butt and I
[40:41.440 --> 40:45.120] 've got to pay the money and I've got to put the system in you know I've got to
[40:45.120 --> 40:53.480]  do what it takes I've got to stop I understand folks why you're not because
[40:53.480 --> 40:57.600]  it's just introduced to you just like you poison a water well have you got too
[40:57.600 --> 41:04.200]  many coyotes out in the desert you simply the old-fashioned way to do it as
[41:04.200 --> 41:07.880]  you poison the water with a slow kill weapon yeah that's cumulative that takes
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.720]  three or four times of drinking it to build up and the hair falls out on the
[41:12.720 --> 41:17.200]  coyotes and they go off and die that's one of the old-fashioned ways to cull
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.560]  or if there's too many junk fish I remember reading a report and one of my
[41:21.560 --> 41:24.760]  buddies who tell me about just the other day out my marble falls one time they
[41:24.760 --> 41:30.840]  they they they sunk one of the lakes down one of the dammed up rivers till it
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.120]  was down to the granite bottom and just a few feet deep to get rid of all the
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.200]  gar and and a carp and then they planes flew over and sprayed chemicals on it
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.240]  to kill all the fish and then poor people went down and gathered up all the
[41:41.240 --> 41:48.640]  fish and went and ate them because nobody told them but we live in a fully
[41:48.640 --> 41:52.960]  engineered fully controlled society and they're just mopping up the final and
[41:52.960 --> 41:55.800]  they're now announcing they want to shut down talk radio today and they want to
[41:55.800 --> 41:59.040]  shut down the internet and arrest people and all over the country they're
[41:59.040 --> 42:02.200]  arresting activists that we are change activists Bruno we're getting him on
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.640]  Sunday or Monday he got arrested you know filming government stuff so whether
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.280]  we are change people for no reason and then the judge said I don't like how
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.360]  you look I'm giving you three years in jail for contempt and I've had top
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.600]  reporters on from LA who've been jailed for contempt we had one on a month ago
[42:19.600 --> 42:25.120]  been in there over a year no judge no jury you know not a court date you just
[42:25.120 --> 42:32.680]  you just you maybe the rest of your life it's just total tyranny I mean it's just
[42:32.680 --> 42:39.560]  total evil folks it's here okay but you get these petty dumbed-down fluoride
[42:39.560 --> 42:43.720]  mercury head cops they go and they it's on record they pick people under under
[42:43.720 --> 42:47.240]  IQ they don't want somebody who can think and I'm not even bashing you you
[42:47.240 --> 42:50.360]  understand that fools I'm explaining you you're just like the general public
[42:50.360 --> 42:55.880]  you're dumbed-down you're stupid on average you like your petty power do you
[42:55.880 --> 43:02.160]  understand you're being poisoned just like they poison a small pool in the
[43:02.160 --> 43:05.480]  desert to kill the coyotes
[43:07.640 --> 43:15.080]  okay do you understand that white flour
[43:15.080 --> 43:28.880]  hamburger bun is going to sterilize you you understand that you understand that
[43:28.880 --> 43:37.280]  the water is brain damaging you most of the filtered water you buy in a bottle
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.720]  has more fluoride they add it to it most filters won't cut it out do you
[43:42.720 --> 43:56.280]  understand me do you hear me you are being poisoned and you've been they
[43:56.280 --> 43:59.520]  understand habits they understand that mammals what they do over and over again
[43:59.520 --> 44:03.680]  as a habit is psychologically to subconscious level in an animalistic
[44:03.680 --> 44:09.360]  level considered to be healthy it's like your body thinks of cigarettes is good
[44:09.360 --> 44:14.880]  or as liquor is good even though it's poison poisons tend to be addicting
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.800]  okay you think tap water is good because you've done it tens of thousands of
[44:20.800 --> 44:24.760]  times and you've done that motor function of bringing the water to your
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.680]  mouth and your body thinks at a subconscious level it's good it is not
[44:28.680 --> 44:32.360]  that's why you're having resistance to me psychologically right now because
[44:32.360 --> 44:36.560]  you've done it so many times your brain is saying no I've done this 10,000 times
[44:36.560 --> 44:41.600]  it must be good at a subconscious animal level you think of bathing is good
[44:41.600 --> 44:47.720]  because it is good but they've added the chemical to the water your body thinks
[44:47.720 --> 44:53.520]  of eating tasty food as good fat-filled salt-filled high-energy food you were
[44:53.520 --> 44:59.080]  designed in tribal subsistence level development and of course a big fat
[44:59.080 --> 45:02.600]  hamburgers good and the government wants to restrict that big fat hamburger
[45:02.600 --> 45:06.200]  they have all these billboards but how they love you and care about you the
[45:06.200 --> 45:10.960]  government wants to make you live a long time to create to take control of
[45:10.960 --> 45:16.880]  your life so they can put the poison in your food and control the food and so
[45:16.880 --> 45:20.760]  they're seen at a subconscious level as the mommy as the witch doctor as the
[45:20.760 --> 45:27.360]  tribal chief telling you what's safe to eat and what isn't safe to eat but I'm
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.920]  ranting here and I got a lot of news to cover in a long way to short time to get
[45:31.920 --> 45:36.720]  there research links genetically modified food to long-term sterility you
[45:36.720 --> 45:41.480]  can link to the Russian study a new study done by a Russian scientist
[45:41.480 --> 45:45.720]  suggests that genetically modified food may cause long-term sterility yeah
[45:45.720 --> 45:51.480]  bears may do you know what in the woods that is sterility in second and
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.640]  third generation see that's how the soft kill works that's how the mercury
[45:55.640 --> 46:01.760]  works Europe in the United States already have 80 plus percent sperm count
[46:01.760 --> 46:07.760]  reductions but humans are designed to be resilient and so millions of sperm are
[46:07.760 --> 46:17.520]  injected in the act of procreation sex reproduction the act of conception and
[46:17.520 --> 46:24.200]  so the body is fighting through it but many men cannot sire a son or a daughter
[46:24.200 --> 46:31.400]  many women are now infertile or close to infertile you've been hit and hit hard
[46:31.400 --> 46:36.680]  and it's generational it's not just you it's your kids you understand that it's
[46:36.680 --> 46:43.920]  over I've almost got a good responsibility to have more children I
[46:44.600 --> 46:50.320]  just got to beat these people it continues the scientists used hamsters
[46:50.320 --> 46:53.960]  for their research and divided them into groups just like with the long-leaf
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.400]  potato study one group of hamsters was fed a normal diet without any soy
[46:58.400 --> 47:05.440]  products a second group was fed non GMO genetically modified organism so non
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.560]  GMO soy the third eight GMO soy and the fourth group was fed an even higher
[47:09.560 --> 47:17.800]  amount of GMO soy than the third group so there's four groups each group produced
[47:17.800 --> 47:23.200]  about seven to eight liters of baby hamsters each without any problems now
[47:23.200 --> 47:26.720]  this is where it gets important but when the researchers this is in every other
[47:26.720 --> 47:33.400]  study oh that's so crafted so focused but when the research selected new
[47:33.400 --> 47:37.880]  breeding pairs from the offspring the second generation had a slower growth
[47:37.880 --> 47:47.120]  rate and reached their sexual maturity later than normal they also had a
[47:47.120 --> 47:51.840]  mortality rate now listen to me carefully they also had a more you notice
[47:51.840 --> 47:57.480]  a sickly all the children are now they also had a mortality rate five times
[47:57.480 --> 48:07.680]  higher than the hamsters who didn't eat soy five times higher mortality rate
[48:07.680 --> 48:13.320]  that means dying younger even more shocking was the fact that nearly all
[48:13.320 --> 48:19.360]  of the third-generation GMO soy eating hamsters were sterile almost all over
[48:19.360 --> 48:31.000]  90% and also experienced hair growing inside their mouths I've seen the
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.240]  studies now how suddenly men and women are now growing hair on their palms of
[48:35.240 --> 48:40.360]  their hands in their mouths you liked a little you like what the sicko eugenicist
[48:40.360 --> 48:44.920]  environmentalist did to you now they're totally obsessed with only eating non
[48:44.920 --> 48:50.640]  GMO everything's filtered imagine the power trips they're on when they're at
[48:50.640 --> 48:53.240]  the mall or church or anywhere and they're just looking everybody they're
[48:53.240 --> 48:58.520]  killing they're on sick power trips they are murderers they are murdering
[48:58.520 --> 49:04.800]  enemies oh but no the cops got an ADL report on me or Southern Parvy Law
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.480]  Center saying saying I want to kill cops which isn't true so you just better not

[54:55.960 --> 54:59.400]  senators a lot of congress people don't even know this is going on or if they do
[54:59.400 --> 55:05.560]  it's kooky to talk about it so they better not get into it okay well all
[55:05.560 --> 55:13.840]  right that matter of 90 plus percent of the EPA scientist sent letters in 2000
[55:13.840 --> 55:19.520]  again in 2004 on record to the EPA boss saying look you're putting hundreds of
[55:19.520 --> 55:22.600]  deadly chemicals in the water by design that caused cancer why are you and we
[55:22.600 --> 55:31.040]  need to stop this doesn't matter just just say it's kooky I was talking to a
[55:31.040 --> 55:37.160]  researcher I'm just gonna stop there very high level about the Rand
[55:37.160 --> 55:40.640]  Corporation by the way did you get that email about that author he recommended
[55:40.640 --> 55:45.600]  wrote the book about the Rand Corporation and I already noticed this but
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.520]  he reminded me he said you know Kubrick's whole movie Dr. Strange Love is about the
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.720]  Rand Corporation they talk about the Bland Corporation in the film because
[55:54.720 --> 55:59.720]  they invented midair refueling and the doomsday device and it was a guy named
[55:59.720 --> 56:05.720]  Khan who's the character Dr. Strange Love and the whole fluoridation plan was
[56:05.720 --> 56:10.000]  theirs when they read it the Nazi documents we're just completely fried
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.440]  it's just which is unbelievable it's so evil you can't get the general
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.400]  cowards out there to admit this to themselves it takes a man to read
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.320]  government documents saying they're killing us and it takes a man to stand
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.760]  up against it the average coward gets a warm stream going down their leg wetting
[56:27.760 --> 56:31.920]  their pants and just says look I choose the matrix and just runs headlong to the
[56:31.920 --> 56:36.480]  ballpark to sit there and eat a GMO hot dog you don't even love your children
[56:36.480 --> 56:42.240]  you don't care you love dying and I've got to read about each group produced
[56:42.240 --> 56:46.600]  about seven to eight liters of baby hamsters each without any problems but
[56:46.600 --> 56:49.200]  when the researchers selected new breeding pairs from the offspring after
[56:49.200 --> 56:53.080]  being fed GMO the second generation had a slower growth rate and reached their
[56:53.080 --> 56:58.000]  sexual maturity later than normal but wait it gets better they also had a
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.160]  mortality rate five times higher than the hamsters who didn't eat soy GMO soy
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.080]  even more shocking was the fact that nearly all of the third generation GMO
[57:07.080 --> 57:11.800]  soy eating hamsters were sterile and also experienced hair growing inside their
[57:11.800 --> 57:16.400]  mouths and notice how the GMO soy is a liberal thing it's for the earth and
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.640]  Al Gore says eat it and he's on the board of Google and Apple and oh we've got
[57:20.640 --> 57:27.600]  to worship him oh my gosh oh thank you oh God you love me
[57:27.600 --> 57:32.400]  gently modified food has received much criticism earlier to studies linking
[57:32.400 --> 57:36.680]  them to problems with birth weight and infant mortality in major studies of
[57:36.680 --> 57:41.240]  humans but don't listen to me again I get upset about it and that's not normal
[57:41.240 --> 57:47.760]  you're supposed to say oh yes oh and all you yuppies that went to college and
[57:47.760 --> 57:50.040]  we're taught there's too many people and say well there are too many people
[57:50.040 --> 57:55.400]  that's right there's too many of you you don't get it it isn't just the blacks you
[57:55.400 --> 57:58.680]  don't like they're gonna kill in Africa oh they're hard killing him over there
[57:58.680 --> 58:03.040]  some countries 40 plus percent dying they're gonna hard kill you next to
[58:03.040 --> 58:09.880]  Africa is just one phase deeper so you you kind of like giggle and make little
[58:09.880 --> 58:16.800]  jokes about the blackie you want to kill them as you're a racist well you're
[58:16.800 --> 58:20.880]  gonna die too of course you're not gonna have any of the white supremacists that
[58:20.880 --> 58:23.760]  claim they care about the white race so much you'll never hear them talk about
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.360]  GMO or vaccines being bad because they're all Southern Prairie Law Center or Fed
[58:27.360 --> 58:32.520]  Run on record and so though they won't talk about anything real absolutely not
[58:32.520 --> 58:37.360]  they'll just make stuff up all day and get everybody in fighting with each other
[58:37.360 --> 58:43.400]  because they don't want to actually have an effect no no no thank you for

[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.640]  important because it shows how criminal they are but of course all of Obama's
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.440]  supporters and big campaign people are criminals in Chicago of course these
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.200]  buying votes with jobs of course it's all illegal I mean Mayor Daley's the son

[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.320]  major GMO crop that's been tested even in the company's own studies potatoes
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.040]  corn soybeans it doesn't matter has had the added engineered property of
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:18.080]  sterilizing you we got the studies that it creates low birth weights low
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.520]  fertility in the first generation of humans now we're getting the second
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.440]  generation in it's even worse same thing with the hamsters until 90 plus
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.240]  percent are born dead and of the 10% that live they're retarded with hair
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:38.040]  growing in their mouths and their sterile end of the species over and the
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.600]  globalists of course have all the cures for this for themselves yeah you've you
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.320]  just tuned in you heard me right okay get up off your butts the movies don't
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.280]  matter acting cool all of you women out there totally obsessed with your a few

[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.600]  caring about the species and children and the future of humanity you're all
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.120]  empty and unhappy because you haven't found the truth you're all empty and
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.080]  unhappy because you're not struggling for the species the species is always
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.120]  struggled and now right on the edge of what the elite believes is immortality
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.960]  and potentially we're on the verge of something similar to that at least a
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.680]  massively extended life and high technology and true enlightenment and
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.000]  many of the mysteries of the universe being solved and and you know the Bible
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.400]  says the God has things planned for us that the ear is not heard the eye is not
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.400]  seen the mind is not imagined we're on the edge of this and these people are
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.760]  robbing and all from us and taking over our complete human development I can't
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.720]  even get you to care
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.160]  I've got too much evidence I've got too much proof I just wallow in it I just
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.640]  research quietly when I'm not on air and then I get on air I'm like my god I
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.240]  just I just want to warn people it's like I'm in a slaughter pen trying to

[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.000]  structure high-level power structure and they all know about this and they go
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.240]  yeah the elite have made the decision but what are you gonna do a lot of them
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.320]  say you might as well try to somehow join it so that protects your family

[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.640]  tried to introduce him in the senate what does this say it speaks to the
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:48.640]  lawlessness it it it speaks to the corruption it speaks to the fact that he
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.480]  talks about how we're 14 trillion in debt that's kind of like you have a 200
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:00.600]  thousand dollar house and a $2,000 mortgage bill is due this month but you
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:09.520]  owe $400,000 on a $200,000 house on average you'll pay $400,000 so you owe
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:17.440]  2,000 this month that's what's due but you really owe 400,000 so on and this is
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:24.960]  how it configures the 14 trillion is the 2,000 versus that that the the the
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:31.040]  2,000 to 400,000 you understand the commitment is out in the hundreds and
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.400]  hundreds and hundreds of trillions globally 1.5 quadrillion according to
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:42.040]  economists that i put stock in faith in like tarpley all the economists agree
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.000]  it's at least over 500 trill tarpley says 1.5 trill that was a year ago so i'm
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.040]  sure it's more now so let me explain that they want a government to bankrupt you
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.840]  they want a government to get everybody in debt it's all made up to the
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.720]  bankers that's how they get the planet so when he talks about 14 trill 14
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:12.040]  trillion dollars more than the entire GDP in a year that is only what's due now
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:19.240]  now now that's what's due now not the commitments not the expenditure and it's
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.240]  similar to owing $2,000 on your $200,000 home but when you're done paying the
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.320]  house off in 20 years it'll be 400,000 you understand that's what we're talking
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  about here that's our share of the 1.5 quadrillion and growing now if you
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.040]  understand ladies and gentlemen they've got legislation introduced well they
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  already did it with the enemy combatant act it says they can grab a citizen
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.840]  from other rights but that's executive that's just a made-up thing the White
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.160]  House has declared but they're doing it this is legislation to grab you and put
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.600]  a bag over your head you disappear you understand the maximum tyranny and
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.320]  they've got legislation to take over talk radio and free speech they've got
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:06.520]  legislation to take everything folks they are robbing you blind the average
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.120]  congressman the average house member goes into the house already being a
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.760]  multi-millionaire they end up being billionaires many of them look at Al
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.320]  Gore goes in he leaves as a vice president with a million bucks some
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.600]  estimates have him at a billion-dollar worth now tippers cashing in at the
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:30.960]  right time it's the payoff folks they're in there criminally robbing
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:37.120]  everything okay it's over they've already bankrupted is a thousand times
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.240]  over and I mean when I say a thousand that's conservative that that's not a
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.760]  figure of speech okay they have they have sucked the blood out of us till we
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:50.560]  are ash on the ground there's not even a skeleton left okay then they used our
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:56.440]  ashes for kitty litter they are wallowing on our corpse okay the
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.040]  government is a totally lying criminal enterprise I mean it's been admitted for
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:08.240]  two months that they hire and let go upwards of a half million that some
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.480]  reports they say it's a million census workers every month to claim its new
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.720]  jobs and even with those fake jobs they're losing jobs and I've got articles
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.720]  about all the fake job reports I mean it's just all lies ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.520]  of course it's lies they're poisoning our water supply and every GMO crop
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.360]  sterilizes every mammal species is fed to of course they're gonna lie and steal
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.880]  everything they're poisoning your butt they think the world belongs to them
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.960]  and they don't want you on it you're seen as cockroaches in their pantry you
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:47.140]  got that oh my gosh because last hour I read the major new study on three
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:52.240]  generations of guinea pigs fed GMO soy completely sterilized and mentally
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.320]  retarded with hair growing out of their mouth go look at the photos on my
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:03.320]  website just mutated zombies and then we have all the studies with links to it
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:09.080]  where humans one generation eating GMO same things already happening you like
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:14.160]  that you think that's cute you think that's fun you think it's it folks the
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.280]  government has declassified tens of thousands of times that they would take
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.680]  children and and radiate them to death foster children in our government where
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.280]  they would give pregnant wives of gi's uranium plutonium pills just to see
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.720]  what type of miscarriage they'd have or where they'd march trips into a chamber
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.400]  or own trips and nerve gas them oh the government wouldn't carry out 9-11
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:39.040]  grow up grow up they use this fake patriotism to gut the country okay you
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.760]  better grow up I'm risking my life to do this I'm gonna say I'm not scared one
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.360]  bit about him killing me I could care less I'm not scared one bit to give you
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.080]  this information that's a normal human instinct when your entire species is
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.240]  threatened your entire tribe is threatened for a man to care less about
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.360]  what happens to him to fight you you've had your instinct stripped and your
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.760]  humanity sucked out of you if you've got any fear of these people my only fear
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.520]  is not doing a good job and not fighting them hard enough and not
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:14.160]  motivating enough people to defeat this scum bunch of control freaks bunch of
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.160]  chicken neck you go to these globalist conferences that are public with all the
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.880]  scientists and all the talking about exterminating us bunch of chicken neck
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.960]  control freaks on a power trip all right I said I got a bunch of news and I got a
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.160]  cover cuz all these guests are coming up let's play Senator DeMint talking about
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.720]  how 90 plus percent of the bills aren't even looked at you understand that's a
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.240]  lawless criminal out of control government but don't worry some car
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.400]  cleaning place doesn't pay a four cents tax bill armed IRS shows up to threaten
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  them because they're all busy by law only focusing on little people not on the
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.320]  big boys stealing everything they'll bust an occasional Hollywood person knowing
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:57.640]  it's high-profile it's just a lawless total criminals got it here it is and I
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:03.240]  appreciate him willing to to put some solutions forth here but I think it's
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:09.240]  really important that we talk about the bigger picture when we talk about secret
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.400]  holes and I do want to make it clear I'm not interested in holding anything in
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.640]  secret as a matter of fact whenever we do as part of steering or personally we
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.600]  let the cloakroom know they can tell anyone they want that we're holding a
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.720]  bill so I'm not trying to preserve any kind of aspect of a secret hole but I
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:34.040]  think it is important that America know what we're talking about here at this
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:44.200]  point in the Senate 94% of all the bills are past unanimous consent 94% so
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:49.720]  this is hardly a lack of productivity and what this means is 94% of the bills
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:56.280]  that passed the Senate have no debate no vote no amendments no reading of the
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.560]  bill no online disclosure and very often no score from the Congressional
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.880]  Budget Office when I first took over the steering committee one of the things I
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:11.240]  learned real quickly is that whenever we're having a break if we're going for
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:17.400]  a week like we are this week on my way to the airport I would get a call from
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.600]  staff telling me there were dozens of requests to pass bills unanimous consent
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.440]  because they knew we were all out of going out of town and a lot of them had
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.000]  some pretty big price tags on them folks you don't get $13 trillion in debt when
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.720]  you're doing things right and part of the problem is that 94% of the bills that
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:41.520]  pass the Senate pass in secret the problem is not secret holes it's a secret
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.040]  passing of bills when very often we don't even know who's requesting bills
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.320]  and if we didn't have staff available at night when they run their so-called
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:56.960]  hotlines which means the phone in your office rings they ask if you will agree
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:04.440]  to pass a bill you haven't read it you don't know what it's cost but if you
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:11.880]  don't agree to pass it by unanimous consent you are holding the bill if you
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.680]  ask to read it for the next day or two it's very likely that some association
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.320]  is getting emails from either the Republican or the Democrat side that
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.800]  that senator Mitt is holding this desperately needed piece of legislation
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:32.960]  who nobody else has read I'd be glad to work with my colleagues on dealing with
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.000]  this issue if they believe secret holes are problem but I frankly think passing
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.720]  94% of the bills without anybody even reading them or knowing they're getting
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.720]  passed is not a good way to do business I think it's fair to have some system
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.360]  where first of all you cannot secretly ask for a bill to be passed unanimous
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.800]  consent and that's what goes on here today and we should look at the Cobra
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.800]  and McCaskill amendment where if you want something passed unanimous consent
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.240]  and the dark of night that you have to put it on the Internet for at least three
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.120]  days with a cost from the Congressional Budget Office so we know what we're
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:13.120]  getting into okay you watch the whole video that's only part of it up at
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:20.560]  info wars.com but even that's a whitewash he should be saying this is
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:27.440]  criminal treason they should be passing laws against this this is completely
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:33.400]  illegal by the way all your state legislatures do it two years ago I played
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:39.520]  a local news clip where it showed state senators and state House members in
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:46.440]  Texas voting for each other and voting multiple times and they just admitted it
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:52.800]  was illegal and the Congress people in the legislature just laugh that's done
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:58.800]  it's just a lawless folks they just passed 2.6 billion dollars in taxes in
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.480]  Austin in the next three years that's more than all the taxes combined paying
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.400]  it to offshore banks as a carbon tax I have been to the farmers and ranchers
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.880]  houses that the city of Austin took in Southwest Austin 12 years ago and then
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.920]  they turned around and took the restrictions off and built on it and the
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.680]  very city council people now are bankers that own it I mean it's just total
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.880]  mafia evil everywhere do you understand that and it's gonna get worse of course
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.160]  they've built FEMA camps of course they're militarizing police of course
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.360]  they're in the Fort Worth Star telegram with the police chief injecting
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.080]  roids and you know telling people they all need to take steroids so they're all
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:44.560]  a bunch of roid raging maniacs running around feeding on us I mean this is a

[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:38.120]  currently taking place in Sages Spain after he apparently tempted to pull a
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.000]  bait and switch by pretending to attend another event before being forced to
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.600]  admit to journalists that he will give a speech at the globalist confab of course
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:53.480]  last year at the same time they were meeting in in Greece that he was meeting
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.400]  in the headline was world elite meet to discuss overpopulation in New York at
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.940]  Rockefeller University Gates let slip that he would make his debut the
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:07.240]  Bilderberg after being asked by journalists from 20 mementos a free
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.560]  Spanish newspaper which is published daily in numerous Spanish cities as well
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.640]  as others around the world according to the report Gates told reporters I'm one
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:19.240]  of those will be present adding that he will take part in the debate with fellow
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.680]  globalist on the subjects of energy and the needs of the poorest he has a
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.320]  vaccine program for them they won't have any problem being hungry anymore
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.560]  there's no hunger for the dead as well as climate change renewable energy and
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.160]  economic crisis but see he's smart intelligent he's his dad's the former
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:41.960]  head of Planned Parenthood he cares about you indicating that he will also give
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.360]  a speech to the Bilderberg elitist Gates said I hope not too bore it appears as
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:50.840]  though Gates initially tried to throw reporters off the scent by claiming he
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.960]  was in Barcelona to attend a global health insurance conference which was
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.200]  then mysteriously canceled the translation of the Spanish report can be
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.680]  read here Gates presence of the elite confab was also confirmed with the
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.120]  German news agency DPA the Spanish report also confirms that Spain's Prime
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.760]  Minister will attend the conference this afternoon and it goes on Rumsfeld will
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:18.120]  be scurrying scurrying around and others okay so let's go ahead and go to
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.000]  another big article I had Charlie Skelton on the day they kicked everybody
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.800]  out Wednesday the official starts Thursday and I've been in a hotel when
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.080]  they when they shut it shut it down and run you out when the president of Spain
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.560]  arrived they played the national anthem for him when he went in and then they
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.000]  were banging on the door saying get out of here
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.880]  he said he had big news coming out in the Guardian he wouldn't tell me what it
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.680]  was so I don't really even know the point of having mr. Skelton on though
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.720]  he's a great guy I like him he spilled his guts last year about what's
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:55.600]  happening so well I gotta file it in the Guardian first well I I then read the
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.440]  Guardian yesterday last night I hadn't read his article during the day though
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.680]  it we'd actually link to it the the big news was about yours truly he was
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:14.000]  Bilderberg group servants security were talking about me and how scary I was
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.960]  and I guess I am scary to them I mean I know they're criminals I actually read
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.000]  their own documents I follow what they're doing I'm I'm here exposing them
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.880]  and boy I wish Skelton would have told me said oh there is some other big news I
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:33.000]  heard inside but you'll have to read the Guardian to know about it so maybe he'll
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.880]  tell me what he got arrested last year that was all over the news trying to
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.480]  sneak around an infiltrate but his wife's a witness to all this he took his
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:47.080]  wife along with him this year so he's coming up but yeah so very frightening
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:52.880]  and I'm frightening them oh and and they said that it's a threat that the
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.560]  welfare state and I see they see it as allowing you to have a job or money or
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.600]  any property as a welfare state they see it as they own the planet people got
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.440]  confused by that you know Howard Journalist being able to travel to
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.840]  Bilderberg the welfare state well they say they want a post-industrial world

[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.120]  Paul Joseph Watson today this is being reported by the major French news at a
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.520]  press conference he snuck into Spain got caught there and now admits that
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.680]  eugenicist Bill Gates to attend 2010 Bilderberg conference but the really big
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:43.360]  news because it shows how scared they are internally and it shows this mirrors
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:47.360]  what's the big presence he said three weeks ago in Canada when he said for
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.240]  the first time the whole world is awake to world government and not just our
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.800]  puppet politicians but the actual power structure we're in trouble people said
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.440]  well he's playing possum no he's not playing possum and so Bilderberg see
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:05.080]  people with income as threat to their agenda this was filed in part two of his
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.880]  London Guardian report Bilderberg 2010 the security lock down Charlie skelton

[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.480]  overheard them saying and then he could tell us what happened yesterday and
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:28.040]  today Charlie skelton thank you for joining us sir hello lovely to be back
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.840]  good to have you so how you've got the floor you can now since you filed your
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.440]  reports tell us because you know it's good to give them the scoop first they
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.400]  paid to send you there you work for him tell us to the incredible what you
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.160]  witness inside sneaking about spying on them and before they kicked you out and
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.000]  then what's happened since then yeah well first of all yeah to talk about what
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.440]  you mentioned we we sat ourselves at dinner next this is a couple of days
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.040]  before the in fact the night before lockdown so whatever night that would
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:03.840]  have been Tuesday night and we sat next to some of the conference organisers
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.120]  because what people have to remember is that this is apart from anything else
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.520]  it's a big conference so there's a large team of extremely well-oiled
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.360]  conference organisers who run the whole show every year at least the you know the
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.280]  core team members do and they were having their dinner so we sat ourselves
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.240]  down nice and innocently next to their table and we just happened pretended to
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.200]  have a conversation all night whilst listening so yeah we did a little bit
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:31.040]  of ear-wigging and one of the things that we heard that was most astonishing
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.840]  was was the discussion that took place about about you and about your presence
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:42.080]  at Bilderberg with your bullhorn and they started saying you know they said
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.680]  you've seen the videos from that year this is a quote you've seen the videos
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.560]  from that year they were very close to the hotel and that the the person looked
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:53.040]  in absolute terror and said but did they ever try to attack and their person
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.840]  looked back equally fearful and said no no but it was scary it was very scary
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:02.320]  there was a demonstration at the walls and you know did they ever try to attack
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.480]  and they were asking this absolutely seriously they were having this
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:10.120]  discussion and you know I'm here now with looking I'm here with people and
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.640]  the people who are standing here at the roundabout much as you did before and
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.360]  you know they're saying that they're saying their slogans and they're
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.240]  holding their banners and there's an awful lot of there's a little bit of
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.000]  anger towards the people up the hill but generally speaking there's a lot of
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.680]  love towards humanity and there's a lot of concern and anxiety and what there
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.520]  isn't is is there's no great attack going on the only attack is there's an
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.080]  attack upon the ideas that are that are being talked about upstairs the only
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.080]  attack is upon their strategies and but they honestly these these people were
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:44.520]  sitting there and they had fear in their eyes and it was quite extraordinary so
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.720]  you know I don't quite they've completely misunderstood at one level I
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.440]  suppose in one level they've got it right but what they've completely
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.680]  misunderstood what kind of people are outside you know they've they've they
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:01.000]  have demonized the concerned interested citizen who is standing out here who's
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.160]  traveled to whatever part of the world build their captains to be in and is
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.240]  holding their flag and it's is chanting their chant and and they see these
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.920]  people as the enemy and they what they don't understand is that these people
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.520]  who are standing out here chanting they are the they are the true friends of
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.840]  humanity well that's the point you make in your well-written article and I want
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.760]  to remind listeners we contacted you last year hearing that the Guardian was
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.880]  going to send a reporter there was a big announcement the paper was promoting it
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.640]  we contacted you and you're like oh I you know kind of thought it was a joke yeah
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.280]  and you know they were sending a reporter who they thought would really you
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.880]  know be balanced because you thought it was a joke and then once you got there
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:45.280]  and they harassed you and arrested you you know and now you've had this
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.120]  conversion of realizing but you you have some quotes here in your article he
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:58.800]  says it says although quite why attending Bilderberg has to remain such a
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.480]  mystery a mystery remains a mystery the black and windows the limousines the
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.720]  desperate camera dodging of the delegates the paranoia was riding high
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.920]  amongst the conference organizers a pair of them talked about 2006 Bilderberg
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.920]  conference in audible where the radio host Alex Jones led the protest with his
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:22.160]  megaphone they were very close to the hotel you're quoted as them saying said
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.600]  one another look shocked and said did they ever try to attack a shake of the
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:31.800]  head and the answer no but it was very scary a third leaned in this is the
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.080]  negative side of the welfare state people have enough income so they can do
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:41.640]  this it's like a permanent threat and see from what I've read by the phony
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.520]  environmentalist and the globalist they want to shut the economy down only
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:52.840]  allow authorized permitted travel for government approved reasons they want a
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.240]  local environmental boss that controls every facet of your life has nothing to
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.720]  do with environment it's prison and they say they want a post-industrial world to
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:06.960]  control us so that we literally only live and work in one town and maybe get to
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:14.760]  travel once in our lives this is the policy so what you heard was a major
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:20.320]  window into the mindset and they see us as the enemy because they have a
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.080]  predatory view on us and so they subconsciously expect us to hate them
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.640]  and dislike them and finishing up your eloquent writing here you went on to
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:37.880]  make the point that that that no this is humanity upset about being slaves upset
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:42.160]  about being looted upset about their elected leaders meeting in secret with
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:45.760]  the big owners in fact you said what threat the people concerned about this
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.400]  unfairness of the world should drape a banner over a police cordon that they
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.440]  should shout their anger at the madness of asset grabbing transnational
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.720]  operations whose chairman or sipping beers with our elected officials it's
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.520]  like a permanent threat don't make me spit and then talks about them
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.560]  basically harassing you and your wife please continue yeah I mean let's be
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:09.160]  clear about who is saying this that the person that was this conversation is
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.120]  being had by kind of people on the inner core of the Bilderberg conference
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:16.640]  organization so they're the kind of they're the Bilderberg group people that
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:20.080]  they're the you know they're the sort of people in charge of Bilderberg they're
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.720]  not the people at Bilderberg who are the participants but you know they're close
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:26.920]  to the they're very close to the ideology of Bilderberg this is top
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:32.400]  minions top minions top minions yeah and yeah the we can you can actually
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.320]  identify which level the minions are that by their lanyard colors that we've
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:39.960]  been someone's pointed out that the the delegates have got white white lanyard
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:45.040]  and the I think that the the aides have got yellow and lanyards and the
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.240]  securities red and etc etc over there and I think the cut the sort of logistic
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:52.600]  conference organizers have got green lanyard so it's all it's a very well
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.600]  run event and it's a very big event and my god I the people are starting to talk
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:59.640]  about the cost of this and a very interesting quote came out today which
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:04.080]  is that the it's simply to have you know there's all kinds of different police
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.120]  here you know there's there's the secret police there's the state police is
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.320]  right police there's there's also local police is the Mossos Mossos to squad
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:17.160]  squad which is the local bar and Catalonian police I think and it's
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.640]  a quote has come out today that just to have them I mean they're just the very
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.320]  lowest you know of the police forces around just to have them is a hundred
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.160]  fifty thousand euros per day so the big question is you know who's picking up
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:33.040]  that tab is it the Spanish taxpayer and if so that's a disgrace and if the
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:38.240]  Bilderberg conference is reimbursing the Spanish taxpayer then basically they're
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.880]  using the local police as a private army so either way it's
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.240]  statistically unethical and again up until the last few years almost no
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:53.920]  mainstream media coverage or zero going back a decade and before so they are not
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:59.160]  happy what do you make of the TV and radio as well as multiple newspapers in
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:05.080]  Germany and Spain reporting that Bill Gates flew into a fake conference when
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:08.840]  the media showed up it wasn't real and he admitted I'm really here for Bilderberg
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:13.320]  I mean they even put on a fake medical conference just for him to have a cover
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.520]  this is incredible that is it's quite extraordinary and you know it's not just
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.920]  incredible it's absolutely pathetic I mean that really is sad isn't it I mean
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:27.320]  I find this whole you know the zooming up the hill behind tinted windows and
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:31.200]  then swooping into the underground garage and and distractions and do you
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:34.960]  remember when them President Obama shook off his it was not with him yeah
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.360]  shook off the whole he wasn't president but it was candidate Obama and and
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:42.280]  Obama yeah and he shook off the whole press corps and Axelrod is standing on
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.160]  the plane going I'm sorry he's got to go to tend to meetings and they're the
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:48.760]  press but we were there the Secret Service drove in with three black
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:53.280]  vehicles and they had submachine guns and pointed them at us and we have just a
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.080]  blur of the video but we pause it it's online you can see the submachine gun
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.080]  and those guys are just like out of a movie just just right cuz you know
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.840]  Hillary and him and they're just candidates and I'm out there going the
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:08.560]  real leader in there and then here comes the two presidential candidates and
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.680]  then we announced he was there that it had gone to Hillary from Tucker sources
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:17.840]  and boom Hillary stood down again they're they're picking our president and I
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.400]  as a citizen get a machine gun pointed at me but that's not scary my bullhorn is
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:28.680]  scary and they're scared yeah no they're scared and you know they should be
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.120]  scared because you look at the difference between Greece last year and
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.360]  Spain this year and the big difference it's you know physically it looks very
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:41.040]  similar it's exactly the same kind of setup it's a bit high security hotel up
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:44.320]  a hill you know and police Mediterranean police surrounding it in
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.880]  bath numbers and there's apparently there's been confirmed there's you know
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:53.760]  military divers off the coast in a boat you know that the whole thing is very
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.160]  much like last year you know when the Greek Navy intercepted intercepted a
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:02.280]  couple of you know blockers and photographers and but what's different
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.640]  is that the media are starting to talk about it and you know Alex you've done
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:10.120]  an amazing job because I think people are starting to hear and you've been
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:13.520]  shouting on that bullhorn for quite long enough but you know you look at the
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.000]  effect now and and yeah in today apparently there's a page in today's
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.680]  independent newspaper that's British broadsheet national paper you know that
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.240]  the Guardian actually keep picking up another piece and putting it in the
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.280]  newspaper about just a more of a newsy kind of piece and you know I was on
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:36.200]  Radio 4 talking which is a major news a new current affairs radio program called
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.480]  today no it's Worldwide and I can get it on my XM radio and so this is this is
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:44.720]  that's what you're seeing there neither Spanish newspapers and apparently
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.280]  only Spanish newspaper that hasn't really reported on it is the one owned by
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:53.640]  one of the guys up the hill so yeah but you know it's it's very very different
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.560]  there are more people here and there are camera crews and there are photographers
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.920]  and there are news reporters and their doctrine documentary makers and it feels
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:05.600]  totally different and it's it really feels like a breakthrough so the tide is
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.520]  turning against them exactly as Zabigniew Brzezinski said three weeks
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.920]  ago other intel when you were inside and and and talking to other reporters
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.760]  before I go there can I tell you about something else about the turning of the
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.720]  tide sure which is that now this is I've just literally been told it apparently
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.240]  there's gonna be some footage coming up on YouTube somewhere but the people who
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:31.880]  have been chanting their chant in Spanish on the roundabout here they've
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.320]  been chanting to the police they've been saying yeah you have a heart behind
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:40.400]  your badge you have a brain under your hat after the football they've been
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:43.680]  chanting after the football we're the ones you'll be having a beer with we're
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.360]  the ones you should be protecting and they kept saying this you have a heart
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:50.880]  behind your badge and apparently this is I've been told one of the policemen
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.040]  took off his hat turned to his colleagues and said I'm sorry I can't do
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.520]  this anymore and walked across the street and joined the during the protesters
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.720]  now apparently there's footage of that but if that's the case that right there
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:06.160]  is the power of you know I sound like an idiot but that's the power of truth and
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.440]  it's the power of information we just played the video from YouTube but when
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.800]  they had the machine guns pointed out the windows at us you can pause that
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.840]  later if you're watching this on the web and see it but that's just from video
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.400]  we have video stills online that are even crisper and then they had Marines
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.000]  driving around with clown masks on following us and harassing us again
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.400]  it's all psychological because we dare go and say we don't want our president
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.920]  picked in secret and the Marines are like this is illegal a citizen's yeah
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.800]  that's a good still right there we can see him lifting the machine gun up but
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.520]  there's another shot where it's it's it's pointed out mr. Skeleton stay with
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.640]  us for another five minutes in this segment and then five more five minutes
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.440]  into the next hour then we got Jim Tucker coming up later Bob Chapman and a
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:53.040]  lot more I want to talk about more what you saw inside the hotel as they threw
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:56.280]  you out and what other reporters are telling you what intel they're getting
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:01.040]  but that's really exciting news hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:04.840]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.680]  the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:12.400]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.640]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.760]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect

[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:15.280]  sunshine I don't know when I'm stuck in well Charlie Skelton writes for major
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:20.840]  newspapers including the Guardian he's on assignment there outside Barcelona in
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:26.960]  this resort area at this luxury hotel outside of it and he's got some major
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:34.640]  breaking news for us confirming what he heard the highest level Bilderberg staff
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:39.020]  for the club itself at dinner and I wish you'd had a micro recorder man that'd
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:44.800]  be gold but regardless your reporter so it's on the record and that's good but
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:50.320]  but Tucker saying Tucker told you this is big news tell tell folks what Tucker
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.160]  told you well this is confirmed what Tucker said confirmed what we heard at
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:59.400]  dinner and what we heard is that they were talking about the fact that there
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.440]  are fewer delegates this year turning up to the Bilderberg conference because a
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.600]  lot of them don't want to come because they don't want to be seen to come and
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.200]  because of the security and they think they might get seen so they're not
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.400]  turning up and I heard Jim Tucker say that so what you've got a situation there
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:19.960]  where this meeting is they don't want to be seen to be a Bilderberger I mean what
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:22.520]  on earth does that tell you about the meeting and what does it tell you about
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:27.640]  the fact that you know this the amount of guerrilla journalism and the amount
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:32.480]  of interest on the online community and you know what few journalists have been
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.200]  reporting about this that kind of pressure is building and it's and it's
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.320]  turned into a situation which is untenable for people some of the
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:43.720]  people some of the delegates to come along so they've turned it back and well
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:49.520]  what about 94 Hillary Clinton got a going from memory a $400,000 fine for
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:56.120]  violating the Logan Act as a you know in the White House and then in 2006 we know
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:02.200]  Hillary was in Ottawa she lied about it and here came a US diplomatic armored
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.440]  limousine and they pulled into the underground parking garage and then it
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.720]  left a few hours later and then later we confirmed Hillary was there so I mean
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.360]  it's just incredible and Madeleine Albright in 2008 there's actually photos
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:19.800]  of this online that activist shot I was told because you know we were all around
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.080]  the perimeter bullhorning and yelling and her people so as it was a several
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.200]  square mile area so I didn't see it but I saw the photos she drove in a Volvo
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.720]  and even though it was 200 yards in or so because this place in Virginia had
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.280]  you know woods all around it it was you know quite a park area around it they
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.160]  had police and others and Marines and and playing close guarding it that she
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:44.440]  ran in and panicked and then and then ran back out and there's a photos of it
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.120]  so I mean they are scared to death of the people because of the type of criminal
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:52.920]  stuff they're discussing in there they know I mean they're acting so guilty I
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:58.120]  know it's like build a bogus become a dirty word and I don't wait if it's
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.440]  one of those questions if it's not a bad thing why not just go I don't
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.640]  understand you know if it's just a thing that people are just having a nice
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.520]  chat or if they're strategizing for the good of the world then great why not
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:14.280]  just have those strategy talks and why not just invite the press and maybe even
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:18.320]  ask a few intelligent people who what they might think about it maybe ask them
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.680]  members the press maybe ask the members of the public let's talk about the
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:27.440]  you know how to how to steer our humanity to a better place but you know
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.960]  maybe that's not exactly what's being discussed now you talk about being the
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:34.840]  last person in the hotel and then running you and your wife out with
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.840]  security I described some more what happened inside as they close the gates
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:45.200]  well it's my my wife is as she's got some nerves I was much nerveier than she
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:48.640]  was she decided to just drag her heels we got to the we were checking out we
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:51.600]  were about an hour late checking out they were just they kept ringing the
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:54.320]  room and I was going for goodness sake we have to go and she's going no no this
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.360]  is fun and well she got to reception and then she said oh do you mind I've
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:05.040]  really got to print something out and and they said oh yeah okay yeah and so
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.600]  the concierge accidentally sent her right in this is this is when they would be you
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:11.360]  know they were putting up the trestle tables it was really they would they
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:15.000]  were getting everything just ready all the guests had left except us and my
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.160]  wife goes and sit my wife Hannah goes and sits down right in the middle of
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:24.680]  their the engine of Bilderberg at a computer terminal and suddenly she's
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:29.000]  spotted in this extremely stern Dutch lady turns around and says take her to
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:34.680]  security take her to security you know and they they go pretty nasty with her
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:38.600]  it'll move this

[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:57.480]  hotel you go into you know to the nerve center where they're setting up

[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.080]  they met in 2008 and they start you know cuz I had all my camera got split up and
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.680]  they were get out of there who are you get him get me that camera and then we

[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:20.200]  with the boldness of your of of a frown Skelton and then let's get into any
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.600]  other things that happen you know just I was just saying that you know they they

[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:44.920]  is not a friendly hotel and they threw her out and so we got lost but before
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.440]  that at all happened you know we'd she'd managed to creep behind this is on
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:52.520]  the previous day she was sitting behind the pool some ladies who are running
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:57.920]  through the the biography info of the various participants and she took some
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.200]  photos over their shoulder this is exactly I don't know if you know the
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.960]  scene from rear window when Jimmy Stewart looking at Alfred Hitchcock yeah

[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:12.800]  coming back and I'm I'm across the across the pool and splashing about in
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.720]  the pool trying to make as much noise so that they don't hear the camera clicks

[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:47.200]  the nerve to do because I know you're paying for a lot of this on your own we
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:51.040]  are happy to post it so I mean because I know you're doing some stuff outside of

[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:58.640]  going into break to get this up Charlie Skelton you're amazing and we're gonna
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.760]  get you on Monday or Tuesday after you've gotten back home to the UK and had
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:05.960]  time to rest to kind of you know in the aftermath give us your full view but we
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:11.280]  are very thankful to you and your wife's courage any other tidbits that you
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.040]  forgotten to tell us well I tell you there's a nice little human story which
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:19.400]  is that they were sitting around at dinner and they were saying they had a
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.600]  bit of a problem because one of the participants demanded a smoking room and
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:25.640]  they said but it's a non-smoking hotel and they were trying to work out how to
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.400]  get vodka around this and it's one of them pointed out that the the smoking
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.680]  ban has naturally fully come in for the next few days so that they got under the
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.480]  wire I think they're okay but it was really there's some human stories as
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.400]  well in all of this I mean that also shows how these globalists are obsessed
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:43.960]  with their own little neurotic rules when any normal person would just ignore
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:51.440]  the smoking ban these are neurotic people go ahead sorry no I mean I'm
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:55.720]  gonna hopefully get some more on that story of the policeman who's who's
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:00.080]  which side which would be great and generally speaking the police have been
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:03.200]  good and I'd like to say that you know they've picked a strange place to do
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.680]  this Catalonia where they're you know they're quite independent and they
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.880]  don't really like the Spanish overlords never mind a global overlord so you know
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:14.560]  we're getting a lot of a lot of kind looks from the police and a lot of you
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:17.640]  know when they're saying to us you know we're just doing our job they give us
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.080]  a little a little sort of role of the eyes because they really a lot of them
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:25.400]  and some of them have said outright they're going look at you know off the
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.840]  record I'm with you I don't I don't like the guys up the hill but you know I'm
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:34.520]  unfortunately I have to do this Charlie Skelton it's just amazing amazing

[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:03.160]  not gonna have time to play it today but in Paul Joseph Watson's you know I've
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:08.000]  never put the entire speech up I knew the speech was important that I did in
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.480]  front of Bilderberg they sent out Richard C. Holbrook top globalist even in
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:17.240]  Obama's administration he was coming to speak to us and I screamed at him and
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:21.400]  said Holbrook get over here and he said I forget it about a hundred yards away
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.080]  and we've got video and turned and walked I should have been nice because
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:29.800]  he's this big ambassador he was gonna I guess come try to oh come on guys stop
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.680]  bullhorning us I mean this this would have been a rare first Bilderberg
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.880]  reaching out but that was an example of me not very diplomatic like I just like
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.280]  but the issue is we ran back to the hotel the guys and then just four years
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.680]  ago so it was a lot less you know techy they quickly grabbed the video low res
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.560]  so we could upload it to YouTube and that's the old video that's all over
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:56.120]  the web hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views the one Paul LinkedIn
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.080]  only has a few thousand you know that variant I've got all the footage of the
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:06.120]  whole first half of my speech because because of file size and speed I never
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:09.880]  even I've got thousands of hours of incredible footage of everything you
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:13.800]  can imagine I've never even aired I need to like I don't have the money to hire
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:16.960]  somebody just to dump it all the prison planet dot TV you know that's the
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.360]  answer I need to just somehow because we're trying to raise the capital here
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.280]  to finish the studio and do all this to just have an employee who just grabs
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.720]  raw video and interviews I mean I've got rooms full of DV cam tapes and just
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:33.960]  dump this treasure trove up there but the point is I want to get Bob Chapman's
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.040]  take on this because it dovetails our discussion last week
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.840]  Bilderberg 2010 the security lockdown begins this is London Guardian give me a
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:49.360]  screenshot of this thank you and in it he's there the night before it shuts and
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:54.440]  you can see top Bilderberg staff at the hotel wearing the certain badges and
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:57.520]  I've been there been thrown out as well as they shut and they're at dinner and
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:00.640]  here's this reporter with his wife who came over from England to cover it and
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:05.320]  he's hearing him go oh yes Alex Jones he's very frightening 2006 they bullhorned
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.440]  us they may try to attack us this time oh many of the delegates didn't show up
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:15.520]  this time because they're scared oh my oh my lord it's so deadly so that goes
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:19.400]  back to Brazinski three weeks ago saying for the first time the whole
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.960]  world's awake the global government's in trouble and some said oh he's playing
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:27.720]  possum no he's there being a realist saying we are in trouble he's one of the
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:31.080]  top strategists in the world for these people I mean he's there
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:36.120]  world government extraordinaire you know Bragg's he ran the Khmer Rouge
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.240]  operation you know killing 30% of Cambodia he brags that he that he got
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:45.080]  our government to fund that this is a very wicked person Obama's top foreign
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:53.280]  advisor on geopolitical strategies and he said we are in great danger so they
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:57.280]  are not invincible they are in trouble and then he talked to Tucker who source
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:00.720]  said yes they're scared this is the first time a bunch of delegates did show
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.400]  up and then major German and Spanish papers at a press conference followed
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:10.240]  Bill Gates who flew in the eugenicist this is up on prisonplanet.com he had a
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:15.080]  whole fake medical conference as his cover it wasn't real so they caught up
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:20.120]  with him and he admitted he was there for Bilderberg so this is getting insane
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.320]  I mean they are scared and Skelton said that Spanish police because
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.880]  Catalonia has always been rebellious against tyranny a lot of rebellions
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.000]  there be very beautiful area if you study the history and the people are
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:37.040]  very independent like Americans and others and you know very rebellious
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:41.000]  folks that police were coming across the line and joining the people and I saw
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.560]  footage where protesters were shoving police and the police were being nice
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:48.160]  and friendly and saying please you know I'm you can read their lips you know I'm
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:51.280]  with you and the protesters were back off it usually Spanish police would beat
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.120]  the daylights out of you they're known for being vicious more than many very
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.400]  you know they'll shoot you but no the police are even letting people attack
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:05.000]  them basically so Bob Chapman this is incredible is it not it certainly is in
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:11.960]  Catalonia is one of the great places of Spain I also like down the coast at
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:19.000]  Marbella and Tata Polinas and Malaga but and I'm a big fan of Barcelona the
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:26.280]  football team and but they couldn't have been stupider and to have that
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:33.920]  conference in Catalonia near Barcelona on the north on the coast as you well
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:40.960]  know Danny Esslin's over there and Danny's a Spanish citizen and I think
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:46.880]  that we're going to end up getting far more out of this meeting than we have
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:52.520]  ever gotten before because he speaks the same language as the people who work
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:58.880]  there and I am sure he has convinced a number of them to feed him information
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:04.000]  well he also just addressed a large portion of the Parliament over there
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.880]  Farage and others and one of the Italian EU members got him in to address
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:15.200]  them and so it's now in hundreds of newspapers and televisions that so
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:21.720]  yeah Mario Bergizio so this is huge and that's right it is huge and people who
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:27.320]  didn't know although most people don't realize that Europeans are very
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:33.960]  sophisticated politically and they've known of this sort of thing and other
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:39.160]  things that that are akin to it have been going on for many years and it had
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.000]  such problems in Europe with one war after another that they tend to stay
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.760]  apart from and say look I just want to live leave me alone I don't want to get
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:52.560]  shot at you know I don't want another war and you got to understand where
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.880]  they're coming from and they've had terrible times I mean the 1920s and
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:04.120]  30s in Europe were dreadful and it's no wonder people like Stalin and Mussolini
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:08.800]  and Hitler came to power of course as we all know they were financed from the
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:14.160]  UK and the US etc but they made a mistake I think Danny's gonna come up
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:19.560]  with piles of stuff well we know Tucker already is but but but expanding in that
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:25.120]  let's talk about your take on the fact that they are so scared and for the
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:29.360]  first time ever a bunch of attendees didn't show up and they're in there
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:32.680]  and and they're literally the night before they shot it the the head
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:37.760]  organizers are like you know Bilderberg minions are oh they're scary Alex Jones
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:44.680]  oh I mean this mindset that we're like these dangerous devils well everything
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:51.800]  we do is literal and we do it over the radio and of course we publish and they
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:55.680]  can't stand the truth and you and I've been talking about this for months on
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:00.540]  end and especially telling was what you brought up again about
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:06.160]  Brzezinski and his commentary the CFR meeting in Montreal they're terrified
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:11.560]  because there's no way back for them the question is how can I get out of all
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:18.280]  this there's only one way they've got to have a major war and it's coming and it
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:23.760]  could have been that the incidents with North Korea and Israel could have been
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:29.320]  precursors to that now we got another ship going in now I think it's from
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:38.060]  Ireland and are the Turkish warships going to escort this vessel as we have
[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:44.360]  heard yeah that's another issue we learned this American got shot four
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:49.280]  times in the head you've got all these other aid ships coming in the Turks are
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:52.960]  now saying they're gonna at least break ties with Israel and they've now
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:59.240]  confirmed they are sending in warships so and and the Prime Minister like we
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.520]  have that clip it's up on info wards and prison planet it's in Turkish but he
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:08.600]  just said you know we're now basically your enemy Israel and you're a bunch of
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:13.520]  liars and we're sick of your lies so I mean the whole world is really turning
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:20.720]  against Israel and I want to most of you people don't know this because you're
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:32.240]  younger and I'm older and the Turks are renowned as fighters maybe the Israeli
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:37.600]  defense forces very very good but I certainly wouldn't want to tangle with
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:46.000]  them and when we had the Korean conflict as it was called and was run by the UN
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.160]  so that the enemy knew everything we're going to do until MacArthur said well I
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:58.440]  have it enough of that and maybe in Sean landing and just absolutely destroyed
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:04.560]  the Chinese and the North Koreans but every time they would send Americans
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.360]  into the line they would put the Australians on one side of them and the
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:16.440]  Turks on the other and both of them were very very anxious and adept they're
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:22.200]  putting their bannettes on their rifles and going after the enemy and the Turks
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:27.160]  have to draw blood and if they can't get somebody to draw blood on it's their
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:32.120]  own and so they're quite ferocious people when it comes to warfare well
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:36.360]  that's because it was Constantinople and was a constant scene of warfare for
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:40.640]  thousands of years than the heart of the Ottoman Empire we'll be right back
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:46.720]  ladies and gentlemen as Turkey and Israel collide towards confrontation the
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:50.840]  North Korean Peninsula is heating up their ambassadors saying get ready for
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:57.840]  war we'll discuss it all on the other side with Bob Jeff this is Alex Jones
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:01.200]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:05.400]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:09.680]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:13.680]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:22.360]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:26.120]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:30.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:34.200]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:38.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:40.720]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:05.120]  world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms I get it you wouldn't
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:08.720]  buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:12.320]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:16.040]  social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:20.560]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:24.480]  the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.560]  looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold for the realists there
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:33.400]  have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the US
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:39.200]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300% right now savvy investors

[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:05.480]  people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.320]  republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:13.600]  democracy not mob rule two wolves in a sheet voting on what's for dinner so
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:17.120]  they think they own our land they think they're on our water children our

[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:20.840]  amazing footage and photos he just sent us a bunch of photos that are going up
[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:25.240]  on info wars.com prison planet.com the next 20 minutes he'll be joining us in
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:30.440]  the last 30 minutes today Nigel Farage who nearly survived that plane crash on
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:34.800]  election day the head of the UK Independence Party will be joining us
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.400]  remember the European Union Parliament to talk about a host of issues but going
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:45.160]  back to Bob Chapman Bob looking at this Israel situation I even had former you
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:55.680]  know Mossad spy master on yesterday to get his take and even even this guy
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:59.320]  you know of course he was in the Washington Post criticizing the raid
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:04.080]  calling it so stupid it's stupefying saying what is Israel thinking any way
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:07.880]  you cut it men coming into a ship at night in international water shooting
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:12.480]  on American four times in the head I mean Israel has been supported by this
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:16.240]  country it's been seen as the underdog when the Arabs attacked it over and over
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.480]  again but they're really losing that underdog underdog status but Israel is
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:23.480]  not going anywhere you know that's the thing they're saying we got 400 nukes
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:28.040]  and we don't care what the world says and now neocons in the US are saying in
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:31.640]  the New York Times well we may just have to nuke you know Israel may just nuke I
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:36.320]  ran first I mean this is good this is crazy I mean is Israel gonna start World
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:42.120]  War 3 could very well be and I don't think they do much of anything without
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:48.080]  consulting the people who run things out of New York and London and particularly
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:55.760]  in this case New York and Washington and I think that in order to go ahead with
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:01.760]  such an operation and they really was very poorly planned I think that they
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:06.200]  were looking for an excuse to get a war started and of course the churches chips
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:12.080]  come in with the age ships and Israel decides to fire on them you got a third
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:18.080]  world war going it's really as simple as that I mean you know we had first
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.240]  World War Archduke Ferdinand get assassinated all it took was one bullet
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.320]  and the game was the US got brought into World War one by the sinking of the
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:33.880]  Lusitania running the German Yubo blockade loaded with munitions with
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:40.880]  people upstairs and and so these things just don't happen they're planned and
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:49.280]  we've seen a succession of events that could be called either false flag or
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:54.560]  leading events and I think that's what this Israel thing could very well be
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:27:00.360]  because I think that they're ready to go ahead with their war if not that close
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.280]  to it and I've been talking about it for a long time but never putting a date on
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:10.680]  it because I didn't know but this indicates to me that the possibility
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:17.120]  this could be a catalytic event and well Victor of Shrotsky situation going on
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:21.320]  in Europe and it's not gonna get better it's gonna get worse well Victor of
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.040]  Shrotsky you know basically agreed with you yesterday saying governments when
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:29.600]  they're in trouble like to start wars and every time you've got a global meltdown
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:34.240]  there's a new war and Israel's got all these scandals going right now in the
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:41.280]  Knesset and so does the Mossad chief and so does Netanyahu and so yeah they may
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:45.760]  just want to start a war as a diversion like like Clinton sending cruise
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:52.840]  missiles into an african aspirin factory yeah exactly and you know they might
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.800]  have called up Washington said hey look you know we got all these problems are
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:02.080]  going on and and and explained them and Washington and New York probably said
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:06.440]  well we understand that so let's get the war on me get all these problems in
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:11.960]  Europe the Austrian president didn't attend the Bilderberger meeting they may
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:18.400]  be getting set to front run and default I mean we don't even know and you know
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.240]  get five other countries that are up for grabs as far as the valuation or
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.400]  leaving the euro or defaulting what did you make of the British because you
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:31.480]  talked about a few months ago you said look to England to try to scuttle Europe
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:37.160]  I mean is that good advice the top British companies are giving Greece and
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:42.200]  now they're even telling Spain hey just go ahead and default right and I think
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:50.680]  that is part of the opening salvo on the part of England to try to resurrect
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:29:00.000]  itself and they're just a monstrous trouble and the way for them to get out
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.360]  is they don't belong to the Eurozone for those of you don't know they have
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:10.960]  their pound which is their currency but they belong to the European Union and I
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:17.440]  think and I've projected this before a way for England to try to begin to escape
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:24.120]  this block that they've been thrown into would be to start getting their
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:31.280]  industries going again and start rebuilding manufacturing wise in order
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:35.120]  to do that they're gonna have to leave the EU because they're gonna have to leave
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:38.640]  the World Trade Organization all right stay there we got to go to break I want
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:43.360]  to come back and get into the economy here at home
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:53.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:53.080 --> 02:30:01.280]  network with the implementation of codex elementarius it is clear that we must
[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:04.440]  act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:09.680]  preferences are concerned as of January 1st 2010 codex elementarius was
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:13.480]  implemented within the European Union resulting in the restricted sale of
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:18.040]  many natural supplements including colloidal silver we must take immediate
[02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:21.960]  steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our

[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:43.320]  works when your neighbor's doing better you're gonna do better but they've taught

[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:40.960]  going back to you you know now it's not Bob Chapman two years ago talking about
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:44.880]  the plunge of Europe starting in Greece and then Spain and Portugal and other
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:50.440]  places now it's all over the news total collapse but some people think that the
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:54.640]  US is going to escape this can can you explain to people because just Europe
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.680]  cheered when we plunged two years ago to the bankers and then now some
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:04.480]  Americans are cheering this is like gouging one of your eyes out and the
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.280]  right eye laughing at the left eye coming can you explain that to people well
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:18.480]  what they've done is they've created it into connectivity and it's been put in
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:23.480]  place throughout the entire world over the past 30 years and what that means
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:32.520]  is every time is the action there's a reaction and it's good if everybody does
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:40.440]  well if as you said one party gets in trouble that's not to your advantage it
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:45.600]  should to ultimate disadvantage we'll take a good example the pound just dropped
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:56.320]  from 150 to 120 that means that goods that are expressed in euros are going
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:02.600]  to be cheaper maybe 12 15% cheaper who is the biggest exporter in Europe
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:09.320]  Germany and they're going to make out from that but on the other hand because
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:16.560]  of the drop in their currency the the amount that they pay for imported goods
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:22.360]  such as oil energy products is going to go up and so what Germany is doing right
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:32.440]  now knowing that is going to be the case they are implementing austerity cuts
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:38.880]  they're not expanding or anything like that because they know that their costs
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:43.800]  are going to go up all right Bob Bob I've got an erupt I apologize we've been
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:46.760]  working on getting Jim Tucker on and he's going to come on now for about 10
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:50.280]  minutes can I have you on hold and then keep you a little bit in the next hour
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:54.840]  of course okay good because this is a developing and moving and what you were
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:57.920]  talking about is so important and you've been so dead on the international
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:02.720]  forecaster.com we're now joined by the granddaddy of exposing the Bilderberg
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:07.560]  group and he's got to be proud of himself 33 34 years covering it going to
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:13.200]  every conference being shot at in Portugal you name it being harassed
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:17.440]  being arrested being detained going from the New York Times and Time magazine
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:22.280]  just 10 years ago saying he was a nut and it didn't exist to hundreds of
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:27.080]  newspapers Germany England Australia Spain where the global government
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:34.080]  leaders are meeting it is now mainstream news and he's got moles inside and he's
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:38.320]  there on the ground outside Barcelona as the world government meets Jim Tucker
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:44.640]  good to have you on with us always fun Jim I know you're busy and exhausted but
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:50.400]  just reach down grab by sexual cause I got this information you won't just bear
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.440]  with me a minute yeah and and and literally folks he's so mobbed by
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:01.400]  reporters and and and he is not a spring chick as they say and he literally has
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:05.240]  been fighting to even get to his hotel room for about 30 minutes just to even
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:09.800]  be on with us so we just got him as he got to his room and he's getting his
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:14.320]  satchel he wasn't quite ready and and and we're gonna get him to give us
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:17.800]  because he's got the real some people claim they have Bilderberg sources he's
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:22.520]  got them on the inside and on the outside and and so this is a big scoop
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:27.920]  we're about to get a gym do you have your satchel yes I'm ready okay sir to
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:32.840]  give us the lowdown who's attending what the agenda is what your huge breaking
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.640]  news is and of course the newspaper is American Free Press American Free Press
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:43.440]  dot net go ahead okay one very interesting development which is
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:50.120]  encouraging is that some of the major Bilderberg people are saying that many
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:56.000]  many quote important people quote are not attending this year they'll always
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.680]  find out and we get in trouble at home
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:06.520]  politicians who are embarrassed when
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:13.280]  constituents call and say what are you dealing with these monsters and so forth
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:22.920]  that's a fun thing they're also celebrating the fact that your
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:32.560]  president of Obama has signed off of the International Treaty which will allow
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:38.840]  the UN to come into your house and take your gun away and you repeat
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:48.680]  bureaucrat it's some kind of treaty called the National Guns Treaty or
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:52.880]  something under the UN yeah it's a small arms ban treaty so so they're
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:57.640]  pushing that at this disgusting treasonous event absolutely and the
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:04.120]  people think about this you might pull it George little George Bush they say
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:08.680]  it's not a treaty just an agreement but it is a treaty as you know under our
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:13.920]  Constitution the treaty is the superior law of the land that's why George
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:19.640]  Washington said don't have any treaties don't have enemies be neutral be friendly
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:23.560]  with all nations that partial to none well Jim to expand on that what about the
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:27.280]  euro do they want to plunge the euro to bring in the SDR or are they there
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:32.760]  trying to prop up the euro oh they're determined to save the euro and they're
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:38.120]  nervous nervous about it though of course with the economic crisis but the
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:49.040]  euro is important because it's a part of the world government program but they're
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:58.160]  very discouraged thank goodness they're very downbeat because they follow so far
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:04.760]  behind is also before the 1990s they were Billerberg was absolutely confident
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:11.240]  that we have an American Union the European Union and Asian Union of the
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:15.560]  will and underway and they've fallen they've fallen back they've fallen
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:21.040]  behind and they're very discouraged but they're still persisting on climate
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:28.200]  change as few as that might be as you know the real scientific
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:33.320]  shown in demonstrates we're talking about primatologists experts in the field
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:37.680]  who are they got caught in climate gate they I mean they know it's a fraud it's
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:41.560]  about taking over resources you're saying that's a big agenda what about
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:45.560]  Bill Gates in attendance we know he's always pushing eugenics and climate
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:48.880]  change the Spanish newspapers are reporting that they caught up with him
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:53.240]  trying to basically sneak in claiming he was in Barcelona for something else and
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:44:01.200]  then he said he's there to push climate taxes yes he is and he's attended one
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:10.680]  billaberg meeting in the past and this is a second billaberg meeting and definitely
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:17.400]  they're gonna push the climate change even though they're so far behind on
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:26.480]  that with the scientists no letters proving this whole thing is a fraud in
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:33.080]  fact one billaberg I was said that the climate change we're about with us quote
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:38.320]  quote on climate change we're about whipped incredible whipped incredible
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:42.840]  breaking news and when will we be able to read this in detail at american
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:48.200]  freepress.net is a very well I'm not sure how fast they could get things on the
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:53.800]  internet I'm not high-tech I'm a little mad okay but I mean I mean more details
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:56.840]  will be there I'm a very appreciative of the newspaper allowing you to share
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:01.120]  your your huge scoops with us again the granddaddy of exposing this this arm of
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:05.640]  the global government right up at the top of the pyramid Jim Tucker also I
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:09.000]  talked to Charlie Skelton the London Guardian who was there when they kicked
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.120]  him out he overheard the head organizers saying they were mad at me for
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:17.120]  bullhorning them that they were scared and he said that dovetail with your
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.640]  intel this is the first time ever that a bunch of them haven't attended because
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:27.400]  they're scared of being associated with Bilderberg is that accurate yes that's
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:35.760]  a fact okay people the source has been who knows the billaberg people he's done
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:39.400]  business with him when I first talked to him about Bilderberg twenty-some years
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:46.200]  ago he said oh yes international financial consultant I did not go
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:50.040]  beyond that in describing him but he helped us find Bilderberg over the
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:57.680]  years he's confirmed in this and so forth and they are determined to push
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:04.080]  climate change there's a more let's see I'm getting through notes here but they're
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:11.760]  doing more propaganda of ledger climate change even as we speak and a consumer
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:17.960]  note of course British petroleum is in all the shells and the other big
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.720]  international old companies have long been Bilderberg luminaries and they are
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:27.880]  competitors but there's still a brotherhood so they have agreed to allow
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:35.160]  Obama to be outraged and talk about criminal procedures against BP but he's
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:45.360]  also referred to as one of our brothers among the old industry which has long
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:49.520]  been heavily represented so it's gonna be a bunch of talk like the AIG charges
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:53.040]  they've now dropped in the Goldman Sachs much to do about nothing putting on a
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:59.400]  show what about oil prices what about the dollar I mean it sounds like from
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:04.160]  your past reportage they're going from being in control and planning the future
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:09.000]  to just trying to maintain control they're trying to maintain control now
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:15.320]  their plan is for the gas price to go down be nice and cheap this summer in the
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:19.160]  month ahead they're to go up to four dollars a gallon starting probably
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:23.360]  around November some such time they're saying that we have to do some
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:30.640]  pacification here but then there well that's why they still maintain production
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:40.200]  only 80% not 100% of easy capacity so for every hundred barrels that could be
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:44.640]  produced today only 80 barrels are being produced to generate a future
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:47.640]  shortage there's no shortage at the moment yeah they're creating artificial
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:52.760]  scarcity Jim such such precious time with you what what does this mean I mean
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.120]  how big is this that that that that quite a few members and you have any
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:02.600]  intel on on you know the basic numbers I mean what percentage 10% 20% I mean
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:08.840]  this is obviously a crisis if they can't get their luminaries there
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:14.040]  you want to roll down this is confirmed participants so far well I mean any
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:17.440]  notables we know who the regulars are but is there any notable politician being
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:22.160]  groomed like mr. Cameron who was groomed a few years ago
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:36.240]  well let's see we know that Gessner was to be in South Korea for the G20 Friday
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:43.720]  and Saturday he may show up on Sunday or Monday but nevertheless Larry Summers
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:49.560]  will be there now his last or to your president
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:54.160]  let's see do you need more names of no no that's fine let me shift gears again
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.800]  what about Iran anything about Iran Israel's got nuke subs they're saying
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:03.240]  they may attack you you know you've had the attack on the flotilla the Israel
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:13.200]  Iran flotilla anything on that yes the flotilla thing
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:21.280]  it was a bit skittish about that now and billaberg is not 100% in favor of a
[02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:30.200]  U.S. airstrikes owner on but many of them are well the wars generate money no
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:34.360]  matter what the war good guys bad guys and whatever and all of our wars we've
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:40.640]  had profiteering scandals on both sides in most wars there's no all-white hats
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:49.920]  because all black hats but as world war two during the American Civil War you
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:58.120]  had price gouging on a war profiteering on both sides so they
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:03.200]  financed both sides so so I mean is it leaning towards war or against it it's
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:09.720]  leaning toward war based billaberg is not 100% in favor some in Europe say no
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:15.760]  we shouldn't do it but most of them are in favor of American airstrikes against
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:24.280]  Iran and a whimpering that Iran's got these massive nuclear weapons they
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:29.920]  threatened Israel well Israel's had nuclear weapons in 1962 first revealed
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:35.400]  by longtime billaberg the late George Paul in the Washington Post stop it
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:44.360]  thing way back in the 60s and he's announced that Israel does have nuclear
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:50.880]  weapons and there's some speculation that the fascination of President Kennedy
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:56.880]  made some way for effective act that Kennedy was pressured Israel to disarm
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:51:03.160]  Israel has never joined the non-proliferation treaty they do not
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:09.840]  admit nor did not have nuclear weapons okay but to be clear I mean I mean you
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:15.240]  in 2002 you said Donald Graham of the Washington Post was there he lied and
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:20.680]  said the attack what would be a note to you said March of 03 a year before you
[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:24.920]  were right with precision more than a year before yours because last year in
[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:29.400]  the year before you said Iran was not on the burner you're saying they are close
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:32.320]  to green lighting I mean be specific Jim this is big from your bill de berg
[02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:36.440]  sources you're saying they are moving towards green lighting or it has been
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:43.000]  green-lighted other killing heavily toward green lighting US attack on Iran
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:50.160]  but they're not 100% in agreement but the majority of the bill Berger's favor
[02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:55.920]  US airstrikes own Iran and there'll be some of course some more profiteering and
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:52:02.080]  when you build a life below our young men and hearts above our women you make
[02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:08.280]  money you are these are plus isn't that a political diversion during their
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:14.640]  their their their banking looting well they're off it has that virtue too it's
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:24.000]  also a diversion but he also make money on these are all guys in
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:29.200]  manufacturing you make money when you're making tanks and airplanes and other
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:33.040]  or material yes command destruction I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm only gonna
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:35.640]  keep you a few more minutes because I know you're busy Jim and once you're
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:38.760]  back in the US and have written your articles we'll have you up for a full
[02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:44.240]  debriefing and we're very very honored to have you here with us and I do owe you
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:47.760]  a carton of cigarettes for the last time you were on the road for using up all
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:51.720]  your cell phone minutes but I did deliver the cigarettes last time for this
[02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:55.360]  for the cell phone minutes I'm just joking folks but to be serious anything
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:59.560]  else that's that's really important people need to know was there any time
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:05.520]  frame on the attack on Iran are they concerned and upset about the awakening
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:13.600]  like Brzezinski talked about a few weeks ago yes we think it's gonna be
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:18.120]  here again they're struggling for
[02:53:18.120 --> 02:53:27.920]  our unity on the issue and it till this heaven in favor of war and also they're
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:36.800]  saying that United States must be European nice which means welfare and
[02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:44.720]  health rationing as they do and Canada and throughout the European Union where
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:52.040]  you're paying well over 50% of your taxes and to their national government so
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:57.480]  domestication they want to domesticate us further but they want to domesticate
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:04.680]  us further yes we've got to be European eyes we have to have their welfare for
[02:54:04.680 --> 02:54:18.240]  you retired 55 it'd be a horrible thing to happen this country to come under the
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:26.120]  European style of health care well European style of total socialism for
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:30.360]  that matter but all right Jim I want to have Bob Chapman of the
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:34.080]  international forecaster comm is with us once a week and we're breaking into his
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:37.680]  interview to have you here but but he's a big fan of yours and so I want him to
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:41.880]  be able to ask you a question and I've got one final question for you Bob
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:46.320]  Chapman I'd like to hear what any questions you've got for the legendary
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:52.080]  Jim Tucker well I think the most important question that he's answered is
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:58.760]  that they're very concerned about the Euro and my take is that they're in for
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:03.640]  a big surprise I think it's gonna come unglued we had discussed earlier before
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:10.600]  Jim came on about the possibility of an event being created with the as Israeli
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:19.200]  incident in regard to the Gaza age ship and it could be the catalyst and as Jim
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:27.400]  said the majority is in favor of going into Iran and a prison he gets there
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:36.840]  he'll be howling to go into Iran don't you think so Jim yes but definitely yeah
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:45.760]  he's been an architect of the of the goals of through world the Middle East
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:54.120]  and into the geopolitical outflanking of Russia now that's a great point I'm
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:57.480]  gonna I'm gonna hold you over we're about to let Jim go get some final
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:02.160]  comments from Bob Chapman here at the end but Jim Tucker anything else you
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:05.640]  haven't told us that is important to be related to the public I mean I hope
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:08.280]  people are paying very close attention to what you have to say because you have
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:12.400]  real sources you don't just make stuff up and say that it came from Bilderberg
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:16.720]  sources as some have been known to do I mean you you really have these sources
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:20.520]  and it's been proven year after year these are some incredible developments
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:26.080]  you brought up I mean I any other points quickly but also I just want to ask so
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:29.960]  so they do have a sense of losing control do they think they can save their
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:33.840]  euro is their world government in trouble this sounds like great news oh
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:41.960]  yes it is there far behind schedule of the world government of the but they
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:50.400]  are calling for an international bank tax to be administered by the IMS we
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:56.080]  should become the future World Treasury Department
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:05.680]  so international bank tax where the Federal Trade Commission can say all
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:11.520]  these banks will pay a certain tax of course they'll make up their higher
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:15.320]  charges on interest rates and so forth not their own money really short money
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:18.080]  deal and that's the way to shut down the smaller banks and in fact you've been
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:21.680]  talking about that for 20 years is being on their agenda they're now proposing a
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:26.240]  global government run by the IMF and World Bank that we all pay taxes to yes
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:34.680]  global global Treasury Department under the IMF and the bank taxes of oh that's
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:42.200]  to address the economic crisis of course they say that's a rationale so overall
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:46.360]  would you say this is the most downbeat Bilderberg in the history of the
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:51.840]  Bilderberg I would say so yes when certain quote important people and quote
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.280]  are not coming because of lack they get at home because all these people are
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:58:02.760]  exposing us we get all this mail those calls that's just wonderful I hope these
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:09.080]  very people suffer like they deserve to suffer so they're very upset by the
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:14.320]  exposure thanks to you and others well Jim it's got to feel good 33 34 years
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:21.240]  later to see this mighty harvest of awakening yes it will be like you said

[02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:03.400]  you know I thought it was one of his first interviews but it's his first
[03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:07.400]  interview since the plane crash that almost killed him Nigel Farage coming
[03:00:07.400 --> 03:00:12.400]  up in eight minutes I apologized to Bob Chapman for having him run over by Tucker
[03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:17.040]  but that that that interview was kind of not time to write because what so much
[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.400]  is going on I know Bob Chapman of the international forecaster commiter
[03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:23.800]  stands go there got a free copy of the forecaster and of course we'll have a
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:27.960]  full hour with him next week you were trying to finish up the banking
[03:00:27.960 --> 03:00:32.120]  collapse is taking place but they've also been caught hiring between 400 and
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:36.720]  500 now they're saying some are saying a million census people a month and then
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:41.440]  firing them each month as temporary and then skewing the numbers to show that
[03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:46.560]  is separate jobs so give us your take on that where the economy is going in the
[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:53.680]  next four minutes well the the take is exactly as you described it default
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:58.480]  supplying the data it's just another way of doing it I have a piece in
[03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:03.680]  tomorrow's issue which describes how dreadful the figures that would just
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:10.000]  released are and most people don't realize it because they don't follow the
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:16.920]  incorrect intricacies of how those figures are made up that go into the
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:24.360]  employment report but they were bad and that's being reflected the Dow is down
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:30.100]  right now 315 points and it's going to get worse and it's on low volume which
[03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:35.520]  tells you that it'll probably get down rather quickly from here it's below
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:45.040]  10,000 the whole thing is a masquerade employment the recovery whatever there
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:50.280]  was over recovery is over we're on our way down otherwise Larry Summers the
[03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:56.760]  other day wouldn't ask for 200 billion in and the legislature passed a 73 billion
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:01.400]  extension of unemployment benefits they're looking for 500 billion they're
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:07.040]  looking for the Fed to come in with another trillion and a half the economy
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:14.600]  cannot continue to go even sideways without that kind of infusion and they're
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:17.160]  going to have to come up with it and what's going to happen we're going to
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:21.720]  have eventually hyperinflation first more inflation that they're going to have
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:31.920]  to admit to to nothing not the real thing is but they'll have to admit to it Bob one
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:38.800]  of things I wanted to say was that Jim Tucker and I were together at the
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:44.820]  spotlight I was a financial editor back when it started and and now it's the
[03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:51.280]  American Free Press so we go back a long way what we gonna say no you were
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:54.120]  talking actually suddenly lost audio for a moment so I'm sorry I was
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:56.800]  interrupting it seems like even when I'm trying to not interrupt I'm hell bent
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:02.320]  on it but finish up about Jim the point you were making oh yeah Jim and I he was
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:08.560]  the editor of the spotlight and I used to do the financial column along with G
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:14.360]  Gordon Tether and back in the early days of getting the word out so to speak
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:20.080]  and nothing you haven't done anywhere in the Patriot community you've had your
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:27.600]  hands in it that's good well you know I was I saw what was going on I understood
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:31.960]  the problem I get outside the box they had been trained well I had a great
[03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:35.760]  education and worked in counterintelligence I lived all over the
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:40.200]  world I spoke so several languages I had everything in the world going for me
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:46.480]  and I used it and I'm still using it I'm not gonna get up give up until I can't
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:50.480]  walk and talk anymore well Bob Bob Chapman we haven't won this fight that
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:55.200]  much is clear but you can really see the tide shifting and to hear from a
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:59.040]  guardian prestigious that's one of the most prestigious papers in the world
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:03.080]  saying he was there as they were kicking people out and saw head security
[03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:07.240]  people talking about how horrified they were of me like I was a hundred foot
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:12.760]  goblin I mean that just shows these people are not invincible Bob and I'm
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:17.480]  not people not showing up is very telling that means that they don't want
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:22.040]  the exposure they are undecided whether their program for world government's
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:25.400]  going to work some of them have already admitted that it's not and
[03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:30.240]  Brzezinski's one of them he knows they've got to have war in order to just
[03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:35.960]  survive and they're not gonna survive because if we have a war and once it's
[03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:41.800]  over we're gonna drag all these people up to a Nuremberg type trials and try

[03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:08.880]  Nigel Furr is the former head of the UK Independence Party the fastest growing
[03:08:08.880 --> 03:08:14.040]  party in the UK member of the European Parliament he ran for the UK
[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:19.400]  Parliament and and barely lost against the the speaker position and on the day
[03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:24.520]  of the election his aircrafts tipped end over end nearly killing him in the
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:29.000]  pilot and we were just talking in the break this is his first interview and
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  he'd also just coinciding his book is now published he's now available at
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:40.360]  amazon.com it's Fighting Bull you know the Fighting Toro Nigel Farage Fighting
[03:08:40.360 --> 03:08:47.440]  Bull and it's him with a bullhorn on the front with the with the British flag
[03:08:47.440 --> 03:08:52.840]  Union Jack I guess as an umbrella over his shoulder Nigel Farage Farage spelled
[03:08:52.840 --> 03:09:00.400]  F-A-R-A-G-E Fighting Bull great name and how he's taking on the globalist the
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:06.400]  unelected euro crats that now make 70 plus percent of laws in the UK our fight
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:10.960]  against the New World Order is ongoing Mr. Farage it is great to have you here
[03:09:10.960 --> 03:09:16.120]  sir you've got nine lives just amazing many anybody listening to this but
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:20.040]  sees the pictures of the crash which I'm sure you can get and put up on your
[03:09:20.040 --> 03:09:24.040]  site and these are these incredible photographs would be lying in the
[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:28.240]  wreckage of this light aircraft crash and you just thought for the world I'd be
[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:33.300]  dead and whilst I've been badly injured it really has been the most miraculous
[03:09:33.300 --> 03:09:37.120]  escape it really has folks are wondering I mean I know you've got a stiff upper
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:41.240]  lip but I don't want to talk about yourself but you know the pilot how
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:46.360]  he's doing and and what your injuries were well the pilot was a former Royal
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:52.040]  Air Force trained pilot so you know no cowboy I mean you know a proper chap it
[03:09:52.040 --> 03:09:55.880]  was a genuine accident in life accidents happen you can't insulate
[03:09:55.880 --> 03:10:00.520]  yourself against this he I mean we you know when you have an impact injury
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:07.160]  such as we had lots of unpleasant things happen and just in the pilot had
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:11.960]  had lacerations and cuts and broken bones and he's also got some bad skin
[03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:16.520]  problems he's gonna need skin grafts and whatever and I finished up with ten
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:24.320]  broken bones in my upper body so sternum broken fractures to the spine
[03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:29.960]  mostly not not huge ones and virtually every rib front and back broken plus a
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:33.640]  punctured lung so who were you know a pretty comprehensive list of injuries
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:39.000]  patient a few cuts on the face but nothing too awful but mercifully no
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:44.280]  real-head injuries so when it goes awful guffly urocraft I want to take over my
[03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:47.880]  country and destroy our democracy think they've got rid of me they've got
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:51.440]  another thing coming because it may take me a few months to get better but I'm
[03:10:51.440 --> 03:10:54.680]  going to be back fighting them absolutely and I was saying you're such a
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:59.080]  champion of liberty we have to we'll just stick you in a Darth Vader you know
[03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:04.600]  iron lung and roll you out against the enemy I'm gonna be back and one of the
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:08.360]  one of the really interesting things I mean since I had this accident is the
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:12.960]  one great prediction that I've had over the years was that this attempt to take
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:16.920]  countries like Greece and Germany and to force them together in a single
[03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:21.680]  monetary unit I've been saying for over 10 years that it wouldn't work and and
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:25.600]  while I've been laid up in hospital and back here at home recovering of course
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:30.280]  we're now seeing the collapse of that monetary system we've seen riots on the
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:35.400]  street in Greece we've seen people die and by the way to interrupt on and I
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:39.280]  want to give you the floor sir and the time we have you giving speeches two
[03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:44.200]  years ago predicted all of this you just a few months ago excoriated Herman von
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.480]  Rumpi the unelected dictator openly calling for world government and now
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:53.000]  their arrogance has evaporated the one in Guardian reported that the Bilderberg
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:57.760]  group has has said that they're afraid of protesters and afraid of me by name
[03:11:57.760 --> 03:12:03.040]  so they're just horrified that the public is now identifying them so so how
[03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:07.520]  did you predict all this a and then be going to the state of Europe right now
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:13.960]  well before I was in politics I you know I had a job in the real world for 20 years I
[03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:17.480]  worked on the foreign exchange and commodity markets so I you know I have
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:23.280]  some idea of how the global economy actually works and it really exists Alex
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:27.040]  because things are different you know things are different and individual
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:31.000]  countries have their own currency they have their interest rates and they're
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.240]  able to adapt and adjust to changing global markets and changing conditions
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:40.000]  when you try and pretend as part of your attempt at firstly European
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:43.440]  government but leading on to global government but actually we're all the
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:47.480]  same and we can all come under the same umbrella you know all of my experience
[03:12:47.480 --> 03:12:51.640]  told me that it couldn't work everything told me that the German economy was a
[03:12:51.640 --> 03:12:55.600]  different economy to the Greek economy and that then and that those guys
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:59.280]  joining together in a monetary union 10 years ago couldn't work so I've been
[03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:04.160]  predicting disaster consistently over the course of the last 10 years and now it
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:09.840]  really is happening and if ever there was an example of why bureaucratic control
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:14.200]  of why people have got their dreams and their plans just like the communists of
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:18.400]  course let's not forget because they operated and exactly the same basis if
[03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:23.240]  ever there was an example of why this is mad bad dangerous and will lead to civil
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:28.960]  war you're seeing it in Europe right now yeah a bunch of unelected bureaucrats
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:34.080]  for those that don't know they're exempt from their own EU taxes briefly
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:38.680]  explain I mean as if you're talking to six-year-olds I mean you know for me
[03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:42.960]  because I want it simply how you have an elected parliament but it is a
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:48.320]  ceremonial vassal to the bureaucracy that has the real power oh yeah I mean I
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:52.000]  mean you know the palace of Westminster and I know that you guys of the state
[03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:55.840]  often watch our Prime Minister's questions and you see this magnificent
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:13:59.680]  Gothic building and just a couple of weeks ago the Queen arrived in her
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:04.520]  carriage to open parliament and it all looks magnificent and and and the
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:08.000]  relationship between the monarch and the parliament it all goes back to the
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:11.920]  English Civil War and it's something that has been the envy of the world in
[03:14:11.920 --> 03:14:16.560]  many ways and yet the reality is the whole thing is now a total charade
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:21.840]  because what we've got in Westminster is nothing more than a local government I
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:26.800]  mean think of it as a as a county type of government because the big decisions
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:30.160]  that affect the British economy the big decisions that affect our lives
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:34.840]  employment legislation environmental legislation health and safety I mean you
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:38.880]  name it the list goes on it's as long as your arm all of those things are now
[03:14:38.880 --> 03:14:44.320]  decided by the European Union those laws are made in secret by an
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:48.280]  unelected bureaucracy that is called the European Commission and we the votes
[03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:52.200]  that have no means of putting them in place we have no means of removing them
[03:14:52.200 --> 03:14:58.200]  and this this coup d'etat because that's what it is this coup d'etat of
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:02.840]  British democracy has happened slowly surreptitiously over the course of the
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:08.080]  last 40 years by people whose intention it was to form a European
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:14.600]  government a greater Europe and it is a first step towards global government
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:18.160]  and that's the warning and that's one of the reasons why I'm very keen to come
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:22.440]  on the shows like yours to talk to predominantly an American audience you
[03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:27.240]  know don't think you're safe don't think your democracy is okay there are bad
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:31.240]  people out there and then you mentioned yourself the Bilderberg group you know
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:36.760]  these lunatics genuinely believe they know what's best for us genuinely believe
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:41.800]  in this concept of global government and it will be a disaster and that's why I
[03:15:41.800 --> 03:15:45.700]  gave up a career in business to fight against it well we come in you we've
[03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:48.240]  got about five minutes left in this segment and then five minutes after
[03:15:48.240 --> 03:15:51.160]  that before you've got to leave us weren't want to be respectful your time
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:55.040]  and also your strength recovering from the near-death experience you had in
[03:15:55.040 --> 03:15:59.560]  that airplane crash and it's a blessing that you and the pilot survived to get
[03:15:59.560 --> 03:16:03.440]  back to the collapse of Europe I mean yeah I mean it is collapsing and the
[03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:07.400]  intel we just got from Jim Tucker who's always spot-on I mean you could set your
[03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:11.360]  watch and warrant by him is that they are panicking they're not even sure they
[03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:15.840]  can have world government now they say their carbon tax is basically dead and
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:20.520]  that they and that many of them for the first time in 60 plus years did not
[03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:25.600]  attend so it appears they are now being routed yes they are I mean you know their
[03:16:25.600 --> 03:16:31.120]  dreams are falling to pieces whether it's the single currency union whether
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:35.640]  it's the you know the whole global warming carbon tax scam because scam is
[03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:39.880]  the only word that's appropriate for it the whole thing is failing and it's
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:44.120]  losing public support massively but the day and it doesn't work in practical
[03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:49.240]  terms but you know let's not be complacent about this just because their
[03:16:49.240 --> 03:16:53.600]  plans are failing doesn't mean they're going to stop and my fear is that what
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:57.880]  they're going to do now is they're going to move down a route of suppressing
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:04.680]  free speech of censuring and maybe ultimately even imprisoning those who
[03:17:04.680 --> 03:17:09.000]  challenge them and fight them but I mean the last time Alex I came on with you we
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:14.320]  talked about my discussion that I had with Herman Van Rumpuy an unelected
[03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:20.160]  unknown Belgium who is now president of 500 million people and because I told
[03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:24.880]  him a few home truths because I tried to be like the boy in the hands Christian
[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:29.960]  Anderson tale saying look the emperor's got no clothes remember that I was not
[03:17:29.960 --> 03:17:35.840]  just castigated for that I was actually fined ten days pay for having
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:39.920]  similarity to point out you were censured I was censured and I was fine
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:45.280]  absolutely told it to never happen again so what they'll do as the edifice
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:49.960]  collapses what they will do is they will become even less democratic and even
[03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:53.280]  more vicious against those that dare to speak out against them you know this
[03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:57.720]  battle is far from one just because their dreams are failing absolutely
[03:17:57.720 --> 03:18:01.120]  they're announcing in the US that they now want to restrict the internet they
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:05.360]  want to restrict talk radio which now in the news they're now proposing and I see
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:10.120]  the same things in Europe I mean they can't beat us in the realm of ideas so
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:13.400]  they're gonna try to just shut us up and put us in the tower absolutely that
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:17.560]  he does that is entirely right and I have to say that they're looking at
[03:18:17.560 --> 03:18:21.360]  looking at Obama from this side of the water but I felt this ever since he was
[03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:27.240]  elected you know I really genuinely think that you have got a very dangerous
[03:18:27.240 --> 03:18:32.200]  president indeed oh I agree he has got a cult following though he's only got a
[03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:36.720]  40% approval rating now that group is getting more it's almost like as
[03:18:36.720 --> 03:18:41.080]  Germany was collapsing and the most hardcore Nazis were supporting
[03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:44.120]  Hitler they just didn't care they were going to support him till the end yeah
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:49.720]  yeah I'm constantly struck that there are these similarities between what's
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:54.040]  happening here and what is beginning to happen in America and the people have
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:58.120]  got to start waking up what about the British people I mean I know that you
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:01.000]  say both parties are there you know the big main parties are controlled they
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:08.760]  certainly are mr. Cameron's a Bilderberg Stooley Minion but but I mean at least
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:13.480]  the fact that they threw out brown shows that they're wanting change well it
[03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:18.040]  does show they want change but what we finished up here within in Britain is a
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:23.880]  very floppy coalition government the you know Cameron's conservatives are in
[03:19:23.880 --> 03:19:30.680]  bed now with the most Euro fanatical most anti-democratic liberal Democrat
[03:19:30.680 --> 03:19:36.280]  party so once we've got rid of brown I'm afraid things ain't no better because
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:39.680]  now people got to have time to wake up to the fact that he's running a con on
[03:19:39.680 --> 03:19:44.880]  him let's come back and talk more about the future of Europe and in how you see
[03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:51.800]  England responding as Europe collapses Nigel Farage is our guest member of the

[03:23:59.520 --> 03:24:04.600]  Nigel Farage looking at the political landscape I was talking during the
[03:24:04.600 --> 03:24:07.880]  break I said what do you think is most important and you said well people think
[03:24:07.880 --> 03:24:10.520]  they've elected Mr. Cameron and gotten a change they didn't understand it's
[03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:14.440]  controlled change they need to elect truly independent parties and you see
[03:24:14.440 --> 03:24:19.880]  you're the UK independent party really surging and growing and being ignored by
[03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:22.560]  the media and demonized when they do cover it and it's the same thing here
[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:28.000]  now every incumbent in the primaries every incumbent is being defeated every
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:31.440]  establishment candidate is being defeated so it does look like the
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:34.160]  awakenings happening and I think as soon as people figure out that things
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:37.840]  stay just as bad with Cameron just like with Obama from Bush there's going to
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:42.240]  be a very fast wake-up here can you give us your take on that yeah now
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:46.800]  absolutely I mean look you know millions of people are hopeful that Cameron
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:49.720]  somehow going to be different but you know the penny's gonna drop and they're
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:53.080]  going to realize that actually they've got somebody that looks different sounds
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:56.160]  different appears to be more reasonable but the reality is we have
[03:24:56.160 --> 03:24:59.720]  surrendered our sovereignty we have given away our ability to govern
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:04.320]  ourselves and it doesn't matter a damn anymore who is sitting in number 10
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:08.240]  Downing Street and that's why parties like the UK independence party are
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:12.120]  going to get I'm going to continue to grow and frankly you know that's what
[03:25:12.120 --> 03:25:15.360]  you need in America because again you know I'm looking at it from from 3,000
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:20.320]  miles away but but I don't see the Republican Party actually offering any
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:24.960]  proper opposition to Obama so start seeking alternatives start seeking
[03:25:24.960 --> 03:25:28.640]  candidates that have actually got the courage to stand up for democracy at the
[03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:32.600]  end of the day you know what this really comes down to it's a battle of
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:37.840]  democracy versus bureaucracy and the global government they don't believe in
[03:25:37.840 --> 03:25:41.800]  democracy they believe that they know best they don't want the voters to
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:45.560]  change things and that's the great battle and I think we should really take
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:49.960]  heart because people are all across the Western world waking up to what's being
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:55.600]  done to them and that's why the system is scared you probably haven't had a
[03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:58.760]  chance to see it I don't like to talk about myself here but this is such great
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:03.760]  news it's a big news in ski two weeks three weeks ago said to the CFR for the
[03:26:03.760 --> 03:26:08.600]  first time the entire world is awake our world government's in trouble and now
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:13.280]  Bilderberg a reporter for the Guardian who by the way went for the first time
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:16.760]  last year making fun of us now he knows how real it is he was there when they
[03:26:16.760 --> 03:26:20.400]  shut it down and closed it and he overheard at dinner the main Bilderberg
[03:26:20.400 --> 03:26:24.160]  managers the minions before they arrived talking about all these horrible
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:28.720]  protesters though that Alex Jones bull you know bullhorned us in Canada and you
[03:26:28.720 --> 03:26:35.800]  ask it's so scary will they attack and and they sound like addled children who
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:39.520]  who aren't connected to the real world I'm reminded of George Bush senior on
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:45.160]  TV ten years after they were adopted not knowing what a food checkout scanner is
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:48.920]  but but but you know listening to these quotes he was writing down they sound
[03:26:48.920 --> 03:26:52.760]  like you know almost these glow-in-the-dark people that can't even feed
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:59.840]  themselves you know in Britain and in the EU they've been scared of me for
[03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:03.080]  many many years and that this is the reason I've written this book fighting
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:07.340]  bull I've chronicled how they've tried to put obstacles in my path how they've
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:11.560]  used the black arts against me for over a decade they've done everything they
[03:27:11.560 --> 03:27:16.600]  can to rubbish me to label me as an extremist to try and keep me off the
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:20.320]  media and they've tried to do all these things because they're terrified of the
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:25.680]  arguments because they know but in their hearts most people most of us who live
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:30.120]  in the Western world are tax-paying law-abiding decent people and when we
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:34.640]  realize what has been done in our name we will rebel against it and you know we
[03:27:34.640 --> 03:27:38.160]  just got to keep fighting we've got to keep fighting we know we've got right
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:43.040]  on our side we know but in the end democracy is a thing that will always
[03:27:43.040 --> 03:27:46.920]  triumph we know that every time in the past there be these experiments
[03:27:46.920 --> 03:27:51.240]  whether it's communism European federalism or global government it does
[03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:56.560]  not work so you know listeners remember that bad those things are the
[03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:00.280]  optimistic don't give up and keep fighting well that's I mean that I mean
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:03.800]  in the last minute or two we've got that is what's exciting here is that we're
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:08.160]  reading these quotes I mean we're just normal nice people that want freedom and
[03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:12.040]  sovereignty and they're scared to death of us they're scared to death of you
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:17.760]  they are horrified that people are now testifying before the European Union
[03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:23.080]  parliament about the world government I mean it shows that they're not invincible
[03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:29.320]  that they are human as well what it does is give a little example global warming
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:33.720]  the whole hysteria over global warming two weeks ago Lord Moncton Christopher
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:37.640]  Moncton who's been on your program before and he was a luminary and in the
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:43.080]  UK Independence Party Moncton won a debate at the Oxford University Union the
[03:28:43.080 --> 03:28:47.360]  other week on the question of global warming two years ago for the young
[03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:52.560]  audience who'd been brainwashed that would have been unthinkable completely
[03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:56.640]  unthinkable and it just shows that through the efforts of all of us to make
[03:28:56.640 --> 03:29:01.280]  the argument to connect with the people we're beginning to win if you just have

[03:33:23.840 --> 03:33:33.040]  that won the war and I am so excited to to be here and to be able to announce to
[03:33:33.040 --> 03:33:38.920]  all of you that we are so close to bringing down the new world order they
[03:33:38.920 --> 03:33:42.000]  have organized the collapse but it's getting even out of their control they
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:47.800]  are being identified they are internally scared they are internally upset I mean I
[03:33:47.800 --> 03:33:51.840]  can go on here's an example I go on British radio every few weeks local
[03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:56.880]  radio national radio I was on talk sport the most you know largest most listen to
[03:33:56.880 --> 03:34:01.720]  private radio network in England when it goes into Scotland in the continent of
[03:34:01.720 --> 03:34:06.840]  Europe every caller agreed with me I was on for over an hour about 70 minutes the
[03:34:06.840 --> 03:34:11.280]  host agreed with me and I've been going on that station since it started
[03:34:11.280 --> 03:34:16.080]  probably ten years ago I'm nine ten years ago and it was the opposite ten
[03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:20.000]  years ago and it's the same thing here in the United States because everything
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:24.040]  we talk about is come true and is out in the open we've done the research we know
[03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:29.240]  what we're talking about now the public is finally facing issues and they're
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:33.160]  gonna face the fact that these globalists are so evil that they are
[03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:36.880]  genetically modifying the food to sterilize us that's now coming out that
[03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:41.260]  that is their agenda and that it's worse than even the public thinks because he
[03:34:41.260 --> 03:34:46.000]  wants I've been through this wake-up process in the last 17 18 years really
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:52.680]  woke up about 17 18 years ago in high school as a senior got politically
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:59.160]  active 15 years ago in the middle of college and I mean I remember hearing the
[03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:02.200]  old-timers say they want a world government to exterminate us you say
[03:35:02.200 --> 03:35:06.880]  oh shut up old man and then you actually get the documents these are not dumb
[03:35:06.880 --> 03:35:13.240]  old men that were saying all this they were right about it all and yeah I mean
[03:35:13.240 --> 03:35:16.480]  I I mean I understand folks you know as the king of quote conspiracy theories
[03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:21.480]  I'm not I'm the king of facts here and reaching out to people and taking action
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:29.360]  I mean all I've done is my duty and other people have emulated what I've done
[03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:35.480]  and taken it to even you know higher levels and we trailblazed but we don't
[03:35:35.480 --> 03:35:40.040]  have time to screw around they are gonna start wars very soon you watch every
[03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:43.640]  one of our expert guests who's got their finger on the pulse agrees I can see it
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:48.440]  they're there and they're at their most dangerous but I've always said this it's
[03:35:48.440 --> 03:35:53.960]  better to force them to have to carry out their agenda than to let them do it
[03:35:53.960 --> 03:35:59.480]  their way and take their time it's better to go head up against them because
[03:35:59.480 --> 03:36:02.840]  then we got a chance of beating them if we don't resist them they're gonna win
[03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:07.000]  for sure and and you know they can't stand the spirit of people that just say
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  you know what kill me put me in prison destroy my name lie about me have your
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:16.160]  co-intel pro operators poses patriots and attack me from a thousand sides it
[03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:21.040]  doesn't matter what you do I'm gonna sacrifice my name who I am in this I am
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:26.600]  a kamikaze in the info war a torpedo and when you've got that commitment you
[03:36:26.600 --> 03:36:30.320]  can't be stopped ladies and gentlemen and they can't stand it that we aren't
[03:36:30.320 --> 03:36:35.280]  going to back off we aren't gonna turn around it's like a game of chicken with
[03:36:35.280 --> 03:36:40.520]  two giant speed trains and we can't get off the tracks I mean I'm not going to
[03:36:40.520 --> 03:36:45.840]  turn I'm not going to give up because my my goal in this mission is not to make
[03:36:45.840 --> 03:36:50.800]  it out of this if I do that's that's that's gravy that's a gift from God I
[03:36:50.800 --> 03:36:54.400]  don't say prayers every night lay and again I'm not up here on a high horse
[03:36:54.400 --> 03:36:58.080]  force I'm I'm not up here on a high horse I'm telling you where I come from I
[03:36:58.080 --> 03:37:02.360]  don't say prayers at night like God give me this oh God protect me God do this and
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:06.840]  that sometimes I pray please protect me if that's your will I just ask God help
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:10.680]  help me to be a good person help me to be articulate help me to be focused help

[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:21.120]  upsetting knowing all this stuff you know please and a God has just blessed me to
[03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:25.840]  a level I couldn't imagine and protected us and my family and I have
[03:37:25.840 --> 03:37:30.040]  selfishly a few times said look let them let them do anything they want to me
[03:37:30.040 --> 03:37:37.440]  just please protect my family but the issue is you've just got to have the
[03:37:37.440 --> 03:37:41.400]  attitude you're not giving up now I want to go to Paul Dornanou who three years
[03:37:41.400 --> 03:37:47.040]  ago sent us incredible video and photos he's from Romania but he went to
[03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:51.840]  Istanbul the capital of Turkey and covered the Bilderberg group meeting
[03:37:51.840 --> 03:37:59.840]  there did an amazing job and he's got a website that everybody should visit as
[03:37:59.840 --> 03:38:04.920]  well and we'll get that posted up on the story he sent us he sent us some
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:12.960]  amazing photos and it's infocon.ro just INFOCON.ro there's a lot of
[03:38:12.960 --> 03:38:17.040]  amazing investigative research and reports and he does speak pretty good
[03:38:17.040 --> 03:38:20.440]  English so we're gonna go to him in about four minutes and I appreciate Paul
[03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:24.720]  Dornanou from Bilderberg 2010 we're getting Guardian reporters on we're
[03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:28.120]  getting American Free Press reporters on we're getting independent reporters from

[03:38:32.920 --> 03:38:35.960]  prisonplanet.com they just went up on Prison Planet minutes ago they may not
[03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:39.760]  be up on info wars yet but I briefly wanted to go to Ted Anderson because
[03:38:39.760 --> 03:38:44.200]  you got gold up seven plus dollars today last time I checked let me just look it
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:50.760]  up you've got a gold way up you've got gold running out in Europe well a lot of
[03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:55.360]  it running out in the US and it's the weekend and Ted told me yesterday he
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:59.280]  said I'm about to run out of the Franks that are priced in a market that's
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:02.640]  almost a hundred dollars lower than it is a fifth of an ounce for two hundred and
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:06.960]  fifty six dollars a piece he's almost out of these he's got a few other coins
[03:39:06.960 --> 03:39:13.840]  at the old super low price that nobody can match literally and then it'll go up
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:18.000]  and it's still a great deal so I wanted to bring Ted up briefly on the economy
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:22.560]  the stock market plunging over 300 points today and just to tell people the
[03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:25.800]  brokers will be there to take your order this weekend and you know they have a
[03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:28.720]  lot of other great deals as well and collector collector coins everything
[03:39:28.720 --> 03:39:33.680]  else but specifically these bullion deals I certify are the best deals I've
[03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:37.760]  ever heard of the Franks and a few others he's about to offer the silver half
[03:39:37.760 --> 03:39:41.120]  dollars at nine dollars and something apiece these are really smoking hot
[03:39:41.120 --> 03:39:44.600]  deals Ted Anderson thanks for coming on with us briefly tell people about
[03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:48.720]  today's coin offers yeah sure well right now the Frank is currently at two fifty
[03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:52.520]  six sixty eight which you just like you said I'm holding that price down
[03:39:52.520 --> 03:39:56.400]  British sovereigns have sold out because people in Europe are so excited
[03:39:56.400 --> 03:39:59.480]  about buying gold with everything falling apart around them that they've
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:03.600]  just simply bought out what's available in the marketplace and the Franks are a
[03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:07.760]  European coin too so obviously that's going to be falling under the same
[03:40:07.760 --> 03:40:13.840]  pressure right now the Frank is the best buy at nine fifty six sixty eight but we
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:18.160]  do also have the US Eagle and many other things if you're into the silver
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:21.760]  there's no question about it those walking Liberty halves even if you go to
[03:40:21.760 --> 03:40:25.040]  the internet right now you'll find that they're over ten dollars apiece and
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:31.720]  right now I have them at 975 so that's really a great buy just you know the
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:36.440]  junk silver the the you know the clean rounds we call them all that stuff is a
[03:40:36.440 --> 03:40:41.880]  good buy right now Alex we everybody is becoming so familiar and so aware of the
[03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:46.480]  fact that the central banks are bailing out the countries that you know they
[03:40:46.480 --> 03:40:50.480]  talk about one country bailing out another everybody's in trouble nobody's
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:56.280]  got a surplus of money but you call it a good deal no one that I've seen has
[03:40:56.280 --> 03:40:59.760]  silver half dollars the price I mean I mean we're not just saying this look at
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:05.320]  up folks no one has Frank sit 200 and you know fifty six dollars apiece that I've
[03:41:05.320 --> 03:41:09.160]  seen you bought a bunch of this you're now about to run out you bought this
[03:41:09.160 --> 03:41:13.640]  stuff at almost a hundred dollars you're lower in the market and so any amount of
[03:41:13.640 --> 03:41:18.080]  tiny markup you had when you bought it then is well gone now in the swings in
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:21.480]  the market I mean these are really exceptional deals that people are going
[03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:25.800]  to get into golden silver they need to take advantage of this because I mean
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:28.880]  are your supplies of those silver half dollars in Frank's are they gonna last
[03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:32.520]  past Sunday well the silver dollars are real tight the Frank's I mean I might
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:36.840]  I might not even be able to sell a Frank after last son or the Sunday coming up I
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:41.880]  will hold it at this point at this dollar amount but with gold going up over
[03:41:41.880 --> 03:41:45.720]  eleven dollars today I mean we're talking about Frank's that were priced
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:50.960]  way back at one thousand one hundred and fifty so I'd know I don't think so yeah
[03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:54.560]  it was it was seven dollars a few minutes ago I'm sorry it's up by ten
[03:41:54.560 --> 03:41:59.120]  fifty right now of course that's in the US market it's even all-time records in
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:03.160]  Europe right and the market is very strong and and you know if you're
[03:42:03.160 --> 03:42:07.760]  sitting there with investments in other places you're thinking man you know what
[03:42:07.760 --> 03:42:11.760]  should I do here I just need to tell you I mean the United States government
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:16.440]  right now I mean people usually go to the Treasury the Treasury bills for
[03:42:16.440 --> 03:42:20.880]  safety and security but the government is printing so much money that the
[03:42:20.880 --> 03:42:25.640]  Treasury bills are can even hold value and in the sad part about it is is that
[03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:30.040]  we can't afford to pay our bills as the government is concerned at the interest
[03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:33.360]  rates are out of practically at zero what do you think is going to happen when
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:37.760]  we have inflation and interest rates go from you know a half a point to say
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:42.240]  three percent I mean we're gonna have to increase our budget by almost double
[03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:46.280]  for that you know the United States is broke the rest of the world is broke
[03:42:46.280 --> 03:42:50.320]  there's no way that we're gonna get out of this thing unscathed and you need to
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:54.520]  be getting into gold and silver and as we said as the general public starts to
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:59.360]  figure out gold and silver of the place to be all the common sense I mean I
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:02.960]  believe it's gonna go way up but I don't even buy it as an investment looking
[03:43:02.960 --> 03:43:06.840]  for that I'm buying it as something I know what what a pirates have what a
[03:43:06.840 --> 03:43:10.680]  governments have you know what do criminals have I mean what is anybody
[03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:15.560]  who's down on the street who's smart street smart you want the loot you want
[03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:18.880]  the loot ladies and gentlemen you want the booty you want you don't want a

[03:44:11.160 --> 03:44:14.400]  had continual Bilderberg group coverage because this is one of the most
[03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:18.120]  powerful organizations in the world Jim Tucker joined us who has actual
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:23.040]  Bilderberg group contacts inside the organization in the management level I'll
[03:44:23.040 --> 03:44:29.480]  just leave it at that not well I'm gonna shut up the point is is that you can
[03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:34.080]  say you're watching warrant by what he says and because he's been right you
[03:44:34.080 --> 03:44:37.440]  one year before the Berlin Wall he predicted it they were gonna stage it
[03:44:37.440 --> 03:44:45.040]  he's he told he said March of 03 not 02 for the attack on Iraq the oil prices
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:49.400]  go into $150 a barrel year before it happened I mean on and on he says
[03:44:49.400 --> 03:44:54.880]  green light to attack Iran that it's all going towards that miracle could stop
[03:44:54.880 --> 03:44:58.000]  it I guess I mean just that'll all be written up this weekend at prison
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:01.520]  planet dot com and info wars dot com but that was huge but in the last 15
[03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:06.760]  minutes I want to go to Paul Dornan new again with info con dot ro from
[03:45:06.760 --> 03:45:10.680]  Romania and we have the Bilderberg group photos we'll put some of those on screen
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:15.000]  that he just sent us of a Wolfson and former head of the World Bank and other
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:20.160]  Bill Gates that are there but mr. Dornan new thank you for being there in
[03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:27.680]  Spain to cover this serve a breakdown what you've witnessed hi Alex thank you
[03:45:27.680 --> 03:45:31.960]  for having me on your show right now I'm right here in front of the police
[03:45:31.960 --> 03:45:38.160]  barricade and it gets the word goes to the hotel and I might add that this is
[03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:45.320]  actually my ford deliver coverage so far last year we've been detained in Greece but this
[03:45:45.320 --> 03:45:51.040]  time in the city gets basically we haven't had such problems like last year
[03:45:51.040 --> 03:45:56.400]  even the security is higher than the police here here was nicer with us so
[03:45:56.400 --> 03:46:02.760]  they didn't know take us away work who basically just sit here in this round
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:08.120]  about and managed to get some action some of them good pictures and managed
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:12.320]  to identify some people well that's exciting and of course you've had a
[03:46:12.320 --> 03:46:16.760]  chance to talk to some of the other reporters any other intel that Tucker
[03:46:16.760 --> 03:46:20.360]  didn't cover here I mean you may not have been listening but but well what some
[03:46:20.360 --> 03:46:25.240]  of the news the reporters are telling you that are there on the ground I've
[03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:30.280]  heard there's quite a bit of media coverage yes the coverage is that I will
[03:46:30.280 --> 03:46:34.680]  say extraordinary compared to the previous years in Greece and Istanbul
[03:46:34.680 --> 03:46:39.760]  because I could see even yesterday like up to 506
[03:46:39.760 --> 03:46:45.400]  devastation broadcasts in life from right here from in front of the entrance of
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:51.320]  the hotel world that were the police barricade is so basically I'm very very
[03:46:51.320 --> 03:46:55.720]  surprised to see that happening and not only that I can see lots of people
[03:46:55.720 --> 03:47:01.600]  coming from other countries like Portugal France UK Belgium Czech Republic
[03:47:01.600 --> 03:47:05.760]  the United States lots of lots of people independent media or just regular
[03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:10.360]  people coming here and offering their support coming with the cameras video
[03:47:10.360 --> 03:47:15.160]  cameras and trying to help in a way or another and I even met yesterday and
[03:47:15.160 --> 03:47:20.160]  today and had an interview with Estolian Daniel Estolian and actually another
[03:47:20.160 --> 03:47:26.640]  reporter my documentary maker who has some very very good information and he
[03:47:26.640 --> 03:47:33.040]  was in back in Italy in 2004 if you remember that they were able to make
[03:47:33.040 --> 03:47:38.760]  their some very good photos he also got some very good video pictures with them
[03:47:38.760 --> 03:47:45.000]  sitting at tables talking to people and going on the boat on a trip boat and he's
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:50.280]  preparing these videos for a documentary to be released at the end of this year
[03:47:50.280 --> 03:47:56.160]  extraordinary images and what's important is that he was actually able to go
[03:47:56.160 --> 03:48:01.800]  inside the hotel on Sunday right after when they were leaving and he was able
[03:48:01.800 --> 03:48:07.200]  to see and look at documents that I never seen before about that in the list
[03:48:07.200 --> 03:48:13.520]  about the private conversation between doing emails private notes is this this
[03:48:13.520 --> 03:48:20.600]  year or are you saying you're in years before this was from 2004 okay so this
[03:48:20.600 --> 03:48:30.600]  documentary filmmaker where are they from well we'd like to we'd like to get
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:35.440]  him on something if you give us his contact the contact information and he
[03:48:35.440 --> 03:48:40.280]  has a very very good information sure what did Estolian what intel did Estolian
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:44.360]  give you in the interview you just conducted with him what's his word
[03:48:44.360 --> 03:48:51.800]  basically Estolian confirmed to me that the same topics that were going on and he was waiting to you know to get more
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:49:00.600]  information I have no no special you know updates from from him I try to you
[03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:04.400]  know cover basically everything from what's going on right now right now here
[03:49:04.400 --> 03:49:10.240]  what I'm going to do let me ask you this it's certainly exciting to that he
[03:49:10.240 --> 03:49:15.720]  addressed a section of the European Parliament at the request of an Italian
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:20.880]  member of the EU Parliament so so this is definitely a route did you see the
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:24.760]  London Guardian report that the the reporter was in there as they were
[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:29.240]  shutting it down and and heard the because you could tell by the badges the
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:34.240]  the head of the Bilderberg Club not Davion not at not at the end Avignon but
[03:49:34.240 --> 03:49:38.880]  but but his subordinates talking about how upset and scared they are and and
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:44.360]  talking about myself bullhorning them in in the past and saying that a lot of the
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:50.720]  delegates didn't show up because of fear yes I've heard about that and I
[03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:56.720]  think there are people that maybe are missing we've seen yesterday many cars
[03:49:56.720 --> 03:50:03.000]  but we're expecting much more cars to be to arrive so I think yes it's very
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:07.040]  possible that some attendees are not participating and that's one fact I wanted
[03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:12.400]  to bring up the intel we got from the Italy from this guy Giorgio is that
[03:50:12.400 --> 03:50:20.080]  as in the list that we're getting are not true in 100% I mean yeah that's like
[03:50:20.080 --> 03:50:24.040]  Bill Gates I mean Bill Gates had a fake conference this is mainstream news in
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:27.440]  Germany and in Spain well let's come back and talk about that and then he got
[03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:30.800]  caught by the media he said well I'm really here for Bilderberg to talk about
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:37.000]  basically population reduction so just incredible developments today
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:42.120]  and such good news that these guys are really panicking confirming what
[03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:47.320]  Zbigniew Brzezinski was saying last week I mean folks I'm not a drinking man
[03:50:47.320 --> 03:50:52.280]  myself I haven't been drinking lately but this is the day to pop some champagne

[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:18.040]  infocon.ro amazing photos he gave us so that are up on infowars.com and
[03:54:18.040 --> 03:54:21.880]  prisonplanet.com right now but you can also go to his site and see even more
[03:54:21.880 --> 03:54:25.740]  they're reporting on Bilderberg ladies and gentlemen this is the global elite
[03:54:25.740 --> 03:54:29.860]  and the fact that they're scared and some didn't show up and that Bill Gates had
[03:54:29.860 --> 03:54:34.380]  a fake medical conference in Barcelona that he then didn't attend it wasn't
[03:54:34.380 --> 03:54:39.980]  real and now he admits he is at Bilderberg this is just incredible these
[03:54:39.980 --> 03:54:43.620]  are the people engineering the global collapse Paul Dorna new in the time we've
[03:54:43.620 --> 03:54:47.620]  got left finish up the point you were trying to make yes sir I was trying to
[03:54:47.620 --> 03:54:53.700]  say that you said about Bill Gates well I photographed earlier yesterday Craig
[03:54:53.700 --> 03:55:01.580]  Mundy from Microsoft so they're here what I wanted to say is that from the
[03:55:01.580 --> 03:55:08.380]  other information I managed to get from here is that there might be other
[03:55:08.380 --> 03:55:13.300]  smaller Bilderberg conferences throughout the year for example last
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:18.820]  November in Brussels there was another Bilderberg meeting while only the
[03:55:18.820 --> 03:55:27.180]  steering committee had met so we should try to investigate that more obviously
[03:55:27.180 --> 03:55:32.860]  there are more secret meetings of those people exactly I mean back in the 50s
[03:55:32.860 --> 03:55:36.220]  they could meet once a year and steer things now they're meeting every month
[03:55:36.220 --> 03:55:39.700]  and they and they meet a trilateral Commission meetings others like the
[03:55:39.700 --> 03:55:44.660]  Australian news reported heads of 28 biggest banks meet in secret you know
[03:55:44.660 --> 03:55:48.620]  so so there's lots of other secret meetings going on but but but Bilderberg
[03:55:48.620 --> 03:55:52.140]  being one of the most central meetings has really brought this out in the open
[03:55:52.140 --> 03:55:57.500]  and they I mean Tucker said his 30-plus years of covering it they are the most
[03:55:57.500 --> 03:56:02.500]  unhappy and dejected that he's seen them so that's good news
[03:56:02.500 --> 03:56:07.540]  yes sir well I'm very happy to see that more and more people are waking up and
[03:56:07.540 --> 03:56:12.660]  they are coming here I was not expecting I'd also see that in that much
[03:56:12.660 --> 03:56:17.020]  media coverage and so many people coming from around the Europe and United
[03:56:17.020 --> 03:56:22.860]  States to try to be here and coverage for different media around the world so
[03:56:22.860 --> 03:56:26.940]  that's a very good thing and that's what we should try to do next year as well
[03:56:26.940 --> 03:56:33.220]  be and more and more people have a Bilderberg meeting well absolutely what
[03:56:33.220 --> 03:56:37.600]  I just want to say we salute the work you're doing and and and I mean is it
[03:56:37.600 --> 03:56:41.340]  heartening for you to see more and more people every year more and more press
[03:56:41.340 --> 03:56:45.460]  coverage more and more exposure now world government is out in the open we
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:50.820]  can have a serious debate about whether we want to be slaves or not well what I
[03:56:50.820 --> 03:56:55.860]  think is that right now we can really hope that we can fight them and stop the
[03:56:55.860 --> 03:57:01.940]  new order and try to change the things in the world in closing and we'll get you
[03:57:01.940 --> 03:57:05.220]  back on next week once you've gotten back to Romania to give us an overall view
[03:57:05.220 --> 03:57:07.820]  of what you witnessed there and more photos and video you've gotten we'll
[03:57:07.820 --> 03:57:16.780]  show it here on TV as we sound we'll cast at prisonplanet.tv but I mean in
[03:57:16.780 --> 03:57:22.620]  closing in Romania what type of awakening are you seeing well there's an
[03:57:22.620 --> 03:57:26.300]  awakening in Romania too because you know a few years ago that's where I
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:30.980]  started doing this nobody was talking about it and the one you are talking
[03:57:30.980 --> 03:57:35.300]  about it you there were saying you're crazy this is you know conspiracy
[03:57:35.300 --> 03:57:40.340]  theories and such and such so I wanted to basically demonstrate and show them
[03:57:40.340 --> 03:57:46.540]  who look big is there there and they are meeting it's secret and taking
[03:57:46.540 --> 03:57:52.060]  decisions which you don't know about okay and the effective so basically more
[03:57:52.060 --> 03:57:57.500]  and more people more and more media in Romania as well they make awakening and
[03:57:57.500 --> 03:58:03.380]  try to talk about it even politicians know about it for example in the
[03:58:03.380 --> 03:58:07.620]  transcript of Daniel Estolin's presentation in Brussels I got it from a
[03:58:07.620 --> 03:58:13.180]  friend who is the Europe Parliamentary at Brussels in the Parliament of Europe
[03:58:13.180 --> 03:58:17.940]  well that's incredible yeah it's just it's just more and more we are
[03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:22.740]  identifying the real rulers instead of the pawns the Barack Obama's and the
[03:58:22.740 --> 03:58:27.780]  you know David Cameron's great job stay there Paul Dornanou want to talk to you

[03:58:46.660 --> 03:58:51.100]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[03:58:51.100 --> 03:58:55.140]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[03:58:55.140 --> 03:58:59.060]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[03:58:59.060 --> 03:59:03.060]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[03:59:03.060 --> 03:59:07.620]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[03:59:07.620 --> 03:59:11.660]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[03:59:11.660 --> 03:59:15.460]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[03:59:15.460 --> 03:59:19.060]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[03:59:19.060 --> 03:59:23.420]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
