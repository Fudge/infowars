[00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:15.344]  The bomber spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:16.844]  Target selection complete.
[00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.905]  Time on target sequence complete.
[00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:26.067]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at North Cap, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.689]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:35.757]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:38.177]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:39.777]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:44.238]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:45.358]  You bet!
[00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:49.679]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.640]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.080]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.221]  Shall we play a game?
[00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:00.761]  How about...
[00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:10.929]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:13.233]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.795]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:15.997]  We are in launch mode.
[00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:24.708]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.229]  We're in!
[00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.990]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.511]  We have a Soviet submarine watch detection.
[00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:32.573]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.794]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.975]  Game to be played.
[00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:38.957]  The only winning is not today.
[00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:55.838]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:01:55.838 --> 00:02:03.763]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:02:03.763 --> 00:02:05.865]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:12.034]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:17.456]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:20.836]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.857]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:26.438]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.271]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:34.875]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:42.803]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:45.207]  The U.S.
[00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:49.169]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:57.173]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:59.874]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:04.236]  Of course not, because she's... Really loud noise.
[00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:08.278]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:10.499]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.745]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:42.516]  When you have U.S.
[00:03:42.516 --> 00:03:52.462]  Senators in both parties saying, we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[00:03:52.462 --> 00:03:56.844]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[00:03:56.844 --> 00:03:58.425]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:02.187]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:06.430]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:14.497]  And so, now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[00:04:14.497 --> 00:04:16.520]  Think of their ignorance.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:25.752]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes, on average, of being launched.
[00:04:26.312 --> 00:04:29.234]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:36.399]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.401]  And yes, the United States has those, too.
[00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.004]  That's a Pentagon lie that tries to develop systems that we don't have.
[00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:44.145]  It's on record the U.S.
[00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:45.345]  has those systems.
[00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:50.329]  The point is it's called Mutually Assured Destruction or MAD for a reason.
[00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:05.191]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.493]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:05:07.493 --> 00:05:11.437]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:15.381]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.351]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:28.157]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:32.055]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:38.598]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:41.059]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.639]  Keep doing it.
[00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.703]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:49.864]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:54.866]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:59.829]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:00.589]  Please take action now.
[00:06:10.177 --> 00:06:11.317]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:13.118]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.118 --> 00:06:15.018]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:16.719]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.459]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:26.802]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:34.344]  Well, as Russia's foreign minister said two days ago, the hybrid war, the proxy war, ended a long time ago.
[00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:38.605]  Russia is now at war with NATO, and that means the United States,
[00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:44.593]  The real war, obviously, is with Communist China that's cultural and economic and military.
[00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:46.194]  But the CHICOM agents inside the U.S.
[00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:54.037]  government make sure the focus stays on Russia to put us into a two-front war situation.
[00:06:54.037 --> 00:06:55.498]  That's really the big news here today.
[00:06:55.498 --> 00:07:04.082]  The headline for the broadcast that I just wrote, it'll be updated in a moment to InfoWars.com, says it all.
[00:07:04.082 --> 00:07:04.622]  World War II 2.0.
[00:07:08.567 --> 00:07:16.550]  Germany declares war on Russia.
[00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:25.274]  Russia warns of escalating nuclear threat.
[00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:26.194]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:07:26.194 --> 00:07:28.875]  This is an extremely dangerous decision.
[00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:30.336]  Takes the conflict to a new level.
[00:07:30.336 --> 00:07:33.257]  Furious Russia vows Western vehicles will burn.
[00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:45.789]  As Germany confirms it will send at least 85 Leopard 2 heavy tanks, prompting Putin's TV puppets to call for a nuke strike on Berlin.
[00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.731]  That's the Daily Mail headline.
[00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:52.934]  Putin allies call for Berlin to be nuked after decision to send tanks to Ukraine.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.401]  See how fast this escalates?
[00:07:56.401 --> 00:07:59.742]  Putin lackeys lose their minds over Ukraine getting battle tanks.
[00:07:59.742 --> 00:08:10.226]  Well, what would you do if there was a proxy war in Mexico and a foreign power had overthrown a government that was claiming parts of the United States and then they were putting tanks on the border?
[00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:12.166]  What would we do?
[00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:16.428]  Germany to send battle tanks to Ukraine, angering Russia.
[00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:16.808]  U.S.
[00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:18.569]  tanks we destroyed in Ukraine, Moscow.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.861]  Pentagon now says that Germany has made the transfer.
[00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:26.804]  They're going to start transferring Abrams heavy battle tanks to the zone.
[00:08:26.804 --> 00:08:32.527]  And with dozens of countries making contributions, the tanks will number in around 400 to 500.
[00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:37.110]  Looks like total what Ukraine will have in the next month or so.
[00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.611]  So you can see where this is going.
[00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:48.546]  Addressing a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Boca Raton, Zelensky yesterday thanked Blackrock, JP Morgan, Gold Sachs, and others for their support of Ukraine.
[00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:53.808]  Adds that sending Ukraine heavier weapons, like Abrams tanks, represents big business, quote, opportunity for U.S.
[00:08:53.808 --> 00:08:54.809]  corporations.
[00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:56.389]  He says, come make money.
[00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:59.270]  This is where you make the money in the war.
[00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.912]  Being very Slavic there, very, very direct about it.
[00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:05.973]  Nothing mean about the Slavs, I'm just saying, it's very, very direct.
[00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.010]  You come make money here in our big war.
[00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.411]  Yes, very good.
[00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.372]  Slavic Civil War.
[00:09:11.372 --> 00:09:12.832]  You come here.
[00:09:12.832 --> 00:09:15.254]  Make money.
[00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.074]  We have this video.
[00:09:16.074 --> 00:09:19.656]  German Foreign Minister declares war on Russia.
[00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:21.057]  We have that video.
[00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:24.179]  Putin in negotiation with Taliban to procure U.S.
[00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:26.760]  tanks in exchange for recognition.
[00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:31.849]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:36.150]  Boris Johnson, the sooner we can help Ukraine to victory, the sooner the suffering will be over.
[00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:42.672]  Yes, escalate the war, start the war, and then claim that you're trying to stop an escalation.
[00:09:42.672 --> 00:09:55.536]  So let's play the German foreign minister first, declaring war on Russia, and that's what the Germans have done for the first time since World War II, sending tanks into the Russian zone.
[00:09:58.217 --> 00:10:06.703]  That's why the West said we want Germany to do it first, and once they take the heat for it, everybody else is going to contribute heavy battle tanks.
[00:10:06.703 --> 00:10:10.005]  That way, in history, they can say the Germans did it.
[00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:25.115]  And now the Germans are not just sending tanks from Germany, excuse me, the 84 tanks for 1984 destruction, they've sold Leopard 2s to the entire NATO force, and they're all pledging more Leopards.
[00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:26.676]  So hundreds and hundreds of Leopard 2s
[00:10:28.158 --> 00:10:30.940]  And Abrams tanks on the way.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.202]  The Pentagon, as I predicted last week, saying, oh, we're only going to send 20th.
[00:10:34.202 --> 00:10:36.304]  And then the next week, 50, and 100, and 1,000.
[00:10:36.304 --> 00:10:38.665]  We're only going to send $100 million to Ukraine.
[00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:40.066]  We're going to send $5 billion to Ukraine.
[00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:41.267]  We're going to send $50 billion to Ukraine.
[00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:42.768]  We're going to send $100 billion to Ukraine.
[00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:44.449]  See how it works?
[00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:48.172]  Like every few days, oh, $2.5 billion, $3.6 billion.
[00:10:48.172 --> 00:10:53.435]  Every couple days, another, another, another, another, another, another, another.
[00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:57.498]  And, well, just hear it from Germany themselves.
[00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:04.460]  And therefore, I've said already in the last days, yes, we have to do more to defend Ukraine.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.602]  Yes, we have to do more also on tanks.
[00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:22.352]  But the most important and the crucial part is that we do it together and that we do not do the blame game in Europe because we are fighting a war against Russia and not against each other.
[00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:24.194]  Thank you.
[00:11:24.194 --> 00:11:25.735]  Thank you, Madam Minister.
[00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:27.476]  You gotta love all the liberal women.
[00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:30.061]  Never been in the military?
[00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:33.463]  We always heard from the left, just put women in charge, they'll be anti-war.
[00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:36.006]  Study history, that's not usually the case with female leaders.
[00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:41.571]  Not knocking women, I'm just saying, some of your biggest wars are run by women and started by women in history.
[00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:42.692]  We actually looked that up.
[00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:46.115]  So, we are going headlong into destruction.
[00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:48.877]  Almost every mainline military expert will tell you it's insane.
[00:11:48.877 --> 00:11:51.419]  Henry Kissinger said it for six months until he suddenly got a call.
[00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.321]  Now he's all for NATO membership.
[00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:58.393]  And I know nuclear war and a new world war is kind of unbelievable, even for me.
[00:11:58.393 --> 00:12:05.177]  It's just kind of hard to sink my intellectual teeth into and process it, but it's already ongoing.
[00:12:05.177 --> 00:12:09.900]  And US troops are over there fighting and dying fighting Russians.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.721]  So the escalation is over the top.
[00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:13.022]  Since I mentioned Zelensky,
[00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:16.058]  Thank you, BlackRock.
[00:12:16.058 --> 00:12:17.579]  Thank you.
[00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:18.740]  Thank you, big money.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.781]  Thank you for all you do.
[00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:21.602]  You do so well.
[00:12:21.602 --> 00:12:23.083]  You make lots of money.
[00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:26.545]  Whether you're big business or small, come to Ukraine for war.
[00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:28.326]  Lots of your money come here.
[00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:29.787]  Lots of money go out.
[00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:32.969]  Come to big money laundering operation.
[00:12:32.969 --> 00:12:35.491]  I ban all other political parties, including allies.
[00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:37.533]  I shut down the media.
[00:12:37.533 --> 00:12:39.516]  I torture people to death that disagree.
[00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:40.938]  But I am good.
[00:12:40.938 --> 00:12:42.119]  I am the Zelensky.
[00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:43.401]  I am good.
[00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:44.302]  Oh, yes.
[00:12:44.302 --> 00:12:45.925]  We all need take COVID shot.
[00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:48.428]  We all need make you take COVID shot.
[00:12:48.428 --> 00:12:48.808]  Here he is.
[00:12:50.106 --> 00:13:01.069]  It is obvious that American business can become the locomotive that will once again push forward global economic growth.
[00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:05.891]  We have already managed to attract attention and have cooperation with such
[00:13:06.591 --> 00:13:12.218]  Giants of the international financial and investment world as BlackRock, J.P.
[00:13:12.218 --> 00:13:21.389]  Morgan, and Golden Sox, such American brands as Starlink or Westinghouse, have already become part of our Ukrainian
[00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:22.890]  We are waiting for Patreons!
[00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:40.993]  We are looking closely at Abrams.
[00:13:40.993 --> 00:13:45.476]  Thousands of such examples are possible.
[00:13:45.476 --> 00:13:50.460]  And everyone can become a big business by working with Ukraine.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:14:02.768]  In all sectors, from weapons and defense to construction, from communication to agriculture, from transport to IT, from banks to medicine.
[00:14:02.768 --> 00:14:06.770]  And I believe that freedom must always win.
[00:14:07.978 --> 00:14:13.403]  As we all lose our freedom here in the West, you know, we're not getting funded by BlackRock or George Soros, the new lord.
[00:14:13.403 --> 00:14:15.585]  We're funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:23.511]  We make it easy for you to fund us with incredible top rated products, sold out for over two and a half years, finally back and updated and even stronger.
[00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:32.099]  The ultimate bone broth formula, ultimate bone broth plus, and it has the chaga mushroom, it has the high dose of high quality turmeric, it has the concentrated
[00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:33.867]  I don't know.
[00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.312]  Separately, it's selling out, but it'll be back in, I'm told, in about a month.
[00:14:54.312 --> 00:15:04.536]  Nitric Boost, because Dr. Mickiewicz talked about how she thinks this is the best formula out there, what this is known to do for your blood and your health and all the garbage that's out there in the environment right now.
[00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.797]  This is something everybody should be taking at least once a day.
[00:15:06.797 --> 00:15:09.478]  Adults, children, you name it, it's so good for you.
[00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:13.900]  Nitric Boost from InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsShore.com and from InfoWars Platinum.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:23.347]  Private label of the number one natural testosterone boosting product on the market, and we're able to private label it with 70-76 testosterone boost.
[00:15:23.347 --> 00:15:25.108]  We are so proud of this product.
[00:15:25.108 --> 00:15:35.577]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com, and it funds the operation, the whole enemy operation, trying to suppress men's testosterone, men's natural vigor, with all the chemicals and things in the environment, and this helps mitigate that.
[00:15:35.577 --> 00:15:36.918]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:15:36.918 --> 00:15:41.821]  The other InfoWars Platinum product is PainMD, also a top seller in the country.
[00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:43.042]  We're able to private label under the name.
[00:15:43.874 --> 00:15:44.895]  PainMD.
[00:15:44.895 --> 00:15:46.215]  It has amazing results.

[00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:53.939]  PainMD.

[00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:59.863]  And Bone Broth Back in Stock.
[00:15:59.863 --> 00:16:02.724]  I just want to say about Diet Force.
[00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:04.545]  Diet Force is amazing.
[00:16:04.545 --> 00:16:06.806]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:10.148]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[00:16:10.148 --> 00:16:12.750]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:19.084]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[00:16:19.084 --> 00:16:21.287]  Man, if you're like struggling to get...
[00:16:22.466 --> 00:16:24.747]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[00:16:24.747 --> 00:16:27.467]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:30.368]  You have to get the DietForce and have it to a day.
[00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:32.028]  And just keep at it.
[00:16:32.028 --> 00:16:33.629]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:35.029]  X7 DietForce.
[00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:38.010]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby!
[00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.650]  Now on sale.
[00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.530]  DietForce.
[00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.271]  We're cutting that ad.
[00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:41.471]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:42.331]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:44.352]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[00:16:44.352 --> 00:16:45.892]  God bless Australia.
[00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:47.012]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:16:47.012 --> 00:16:47.612]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:16:47.612 --> 00:16:48.693]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:48.693 --> 00:16:49.333]  DietForce.
[00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:49.753]  Get it now.
[00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:07.769]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Infowars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:09.831]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.532]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:13.093]  They know we've got their number.
[00:17:13.093 --> 00:17:17.837]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:20.439]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:21.580]  We're good to go.
[00:17:37.116 --> 00:17:37.917]  I'm good to go.
[00:17:59.574 --> 00:18:12.101]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[00:18:14.905 --> 00:18:25.152]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[00:18:25.152 --> 00:18:36.982]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.503]  This is why they attack us.
[00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:41.545]  This is why we need your support.
[00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:43.326]  Because we tell the truth.
[00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:45.507]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:45.507 --> 00:18:46.968]  Join the resistance.
[00:18:46.968 --> 00:18:48.249]  Buy products.
[00:18:48.249 --> 00:18:50.070]  Donate to the cause.
[00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.410]  Share the links.
[00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.832]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:59.355]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:05.339]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:17.013]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:29.745]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:41.932]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[00:19:41.932 --> 00:19:50.136]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[00:19:50.136 --> 00:19:58.301]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:06.774]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:08.058]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:36.235]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, as we are already sliding in to what could only be described as Armageddon World War III on steroids.
[00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:49.059]  And it was just about 10 minutes ago that I was in the middle of a segment and I said, I'd imagine in the next week they're going to announce 20, 30 tanks and then it'll be 100 the next week and 500 the next week.
[00:20:49.059 --> 00:20:51.480]  That's how they always start these things.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.821]  Russia, Tank Fury, Nazi scumbags.
[00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:56.919]  Nuke Berlin.
[00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:59.461]  That's the Drudge Report headline.
[00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:04.162]  The headline on InfoWars.com is World War II 2.0.
[00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:12.106]  The Germans are invading basically the homeland and the birthplace of Russia.
[00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.466]  World War II 2.0.
[00:21:13.466 --> 00:21:17.828]  Germany declares war on Russia as US pledges to send heavy metal tanks.
[00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:19.088]  That's a typo.
[00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:20.249]  Heavy metal tanks?
[00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:22.510]  Yeah, they're going to be blaring Slayer.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.824]  I write too fast when I'm writing that and posting that right before I go on.
[00:21:27.824 --> 00:21:29.366]  Alex, you made a typo.
[00:21:29.366 --> 00:21:32.090]  To send heavy battle tanks.
[00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.193]  Will somebody update my mistake please?
[00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:37.277]  Russia issues nuclear war alert.
[00:21:38.854 --> 00:21:40.234]  Watch live.
[00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:42.715]  And if I'm not laughing, I'd be crying.
[00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:56.840]  But sure enough, I didn't know while I was saying that Biden announced 30 Abrams frontline battle tanks to just as the beginning as the Western world pours its weapons in for this ongoing, expanding hot war with Russia.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:04.723]  Here it is now with President Biden delivering remarks in the Roosevelt Room in the White House on continued support for Ukraine.
[00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:06.984]  Let's watch this morning.
[00:22:07.879 --> 00:22:22.963]  I had a long conversation with our NATO allies, German Chancellor Schulz, French President Macron, Prime Minister Sunuk, and the Italian Prime Minister Maloney.
[00:22:22.963 --> 00:22:32.766]  To continue our close coordination and our full support of Ukraine, because you all know I've been saying this for a long time, the expectation on the part of Russia is we're going to break up.
[00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:34.426]  We're not going to stay united.
[00:22:34.426 --> 00:22:36.987]  But we are fully, thoroughly, totally united.
[00:22:38.061 --> 00:22:45.483]  With spring approaching, Ukrainian forces are working to defend the territory they hold and preparing for additional counteroffensives.
[00:22:45.483 --> 00:22:53.445]  To liberate their land, they need to be able to counter Russia's evolving tactics and strategy on the battlefield in the very near term.
[00:22:53.445 --> 00:23:02.948]  They need to improve their ability to maneuver in open terrain, and they need an enduring capability to deter and defend against Russian aggression over the long term.
[00:23:04.005 --> 00:23:16.896]  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the military behind me, they've been deeply, deeply involved in this whole effort.
[00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:24.422]  Armored capability, as General Austin will tell you, has been critical.
[00:23:24.422 --> 00:23:28.426]  That's why the United States has committed hundreds of armored fighting vehicles to date.
[00:23:29.358 --> 00:23:34.899]  Including more than 500 as part of the assistance package we announced last Friday.
[00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:42.181]  And today, today I'm announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abram tanks to Ukraine.
[00:23:42.181 --> 00:23:44.902]  The equivalent of one Ukrainian battalion.
[00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:53.904]  Secretary Austin has recommended this step because it will enhance the Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives.
[00:23:54.631 --> 00:23:58.072]  The Abrams tanks are the most capable tanks in the world.
[00:23:58.072 --> 00:24:01.593]  They're also extremely complex to operate and maintain.
[00:24:01.593 --> 00:24:07.554]  So we're also giving Ukraine the parts and equipment necessary to effectively sustain these tanks on the battlefield.
[00:24:07.554 --> 00:24:13.735]  Send in the clowns.
[00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:19.957]  Don't bother, they're here.
[00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:27.516]  Isn't it rich?
[00:24:27.516 --> 00:24:32.580]  Isn't it rich?
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.682]  Isn't it queer?
[00:24:36.682 --> 00:24:42.146]  Losing my timing this late in my career.
[00:24:42.146 --> 00:24:44.607]  And all the Hollywood trash are foaming at the mouth.
[00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:46.969]  Sean Penn calling for preemptive nuclear war.
[00:24:46.969 --> 00:24:48.210]  Rob Reiner calling for it.
[00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.153]  And they literally say because Putin won't let us turn Russian little boys into girls.
[00:24:56.115 --> 00:24:57.555]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:57.555 --> 00:24:59.316]  Our criminal government started this.
[00:24:59.316 --> 00:25:04.897]  Our criminal government is injecting our troops with a poison shot that doesn't work.
[00:25:04.897 --> 00:25:10.959]  And we even have Bill Gates' next segment suddenly saying, oh, it doesn't work!
[00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:13.559]  We always told you that was the case because it's designed not to work.
[00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.060]  It destroys your immune system.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.840]  It works good for that.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.541]  Remember, the criminals that run our government now run our military.
[00:25:20.663 --> 00:25:31.088]  And I can't tell you how many of the top people in the military, because most of the officers are out of control, but the enlisted people, the sergeant majors, and all those people have resigned.
[00:25:31.088 --> 00:25:35.430]  Not just over the shots, but the critical race theory, the trainees, all of it.
[00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.812]  But it's designed to run them out.
[00:25:37.812 --> 00:25:45.796]  And when they leave, they have the woke military that will follow any order and is going to rely on the drones and the missiles and
[00:25:47.102 --> 00:25:48.123]  All the cyber garbage.
[00:25:48.123 --> 00:25:49.944]  They're getting rid of the human military.
[00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:52.785]  They're bringing in the robot military.
[00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:55.467]  While they destroy the Russians, they're destroying us as well.
[00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:58.008]  The globalists are attacking Russia.
[00:25:58.008 --> 00:25:59.990]  They are attacking us.
[00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:09.615]  They are attacking humanity at every single level, every single day.
[00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:10.376]  And it's despicable.
[00:26:11.482 --> 00:26:12.343]  And it's wrong.
[00:26:12.343 --> 00:26:16.205]  Our government is not run by good people or Americans.
[00:26:16.205 --> 00:26:18.646]  It's run by globalists and all the criminals they hire.
[00:26:18.646 --> 00:26:20.667]  It doesn't say everybody in the government is a criminal.
[00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:22.789]  In fact, some of the most awake people are in the government.
[00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:24.069]  But they're compartmentalized.
[00:26:24.069 --> 00:26:26.391]  They don't have any control over policy.
[00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.451]  And the American people are having policy removed.
[00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:34.212]  But there are governors and there are legislators and there are members of Congress that see it, and humanity is waking up.
[00:26:34.212 --> 00:26:45.315]  So the globalists are escalating us in economic collapse, cyber attacks, war, all of it, as a distraction of the fact that they are the ones annihilating us.
[00:26:45.315 --> 00:26:53.298]  They are the ones taking our freedoms and our liberties away every single day, not the Russians.
[00:26:57.998 --> 00:27:07.954]  I want to cover the situation and the latest developments of a poison shot after that huge Michael Yeadon interview and Dr. Peter McCullough interview yesterday.
[00:27:09.577 --> 00:27:15.200]  And play the enemy now that they know they've been exposed, trying to make you forget that they lied to you.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.882]  So we have incredible clips of Fauci saying he was never involved in gain of function.
[00:27:19.882 --> 00:27:25.964]  Smashed in now with admissions on CNN, Fox News, that indeed it's true.
[00:27:25.964 --> 00:27:29.106]  Now we already knew all that, but now even mainstream media is reporting it.
[00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:29.966]  Why is this coming out?
[00:27:29.966 --> 00:27:33.808]  And Bill Gates saying the shots don't work, never did.
[00:27:33.808 --> 00:27:34.288]  All of that.
[00:27:35.626 --> 00:27:38.590]  And I'm going to tell you why they're doing that and more.
[00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:50.505]  And the fact, in a kick in the face, soldiers fired for refusing COVID vaccine, forced to pay back signing bonuses, even though they got them in some cases five, six, seven, eight years ago.
[00:27:53.953 --> 00:27:55.333]  Think about that.
[00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:56.314]  And of course it was illegal.
[00:27:56.314 --> 00:27:57.374]  It was an illegal program.
[00:27:57.374 --> 00:27:58.794]  It was an untested drug.
[00:27:58.794 --> 00:28:00.475]  You can't make troops take an untested drug.
[00:28:00.475 --> 00:28:02.355]  You can make them take an approved drug.
[00:28:02.355 --> 00:28:04.656]  I think that's wrong, but under the law you can.
[00:28:04.656 --> 00:28:06.957]  But they did illegal things to our troops.
[00:28:06.957 --> 00:28:10.638]  And now Lloyd Austin, that disgusting clown.
[00:28:10.638 --> 00:28:12.258]  Just as bad as Milley.
[00:28:12.258 --> 00:28:15.479]  Just bags of lies.
[00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:19.280]  They're still having the military officers order them to take the shot.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.981]  They're now saying it's a commander's decision.
[00:28:21.897 --> 00:28:24.580]  Even though Congress has cut the funding for it and said you can't do it.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:31.307]  The law says they can't, but instead they're telling commanders, we'll advance you if you make them take the shot.
[00:28:31.307 --> 00:28:34.110]  It's on you now.
[00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.631]  Criminal activity.
[00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:39.055]  Someone open the phones up for first-time callers, long-time callers.
[00:28:39.055 --> 00:28:40.897]  Agree, disagree on one big subject.
[00:28:41.895 --> 00:28:49.064]  Our country going into World War 3, and the escalation, and where you think it's going, and how you think we can stop it, or where you think we're going.
[00:28:49.064 --> 00:28:52.027]  I'll give the number out coming up, but first I want to hit the other news.
[00:28:52.027 --> 00:28:58.435]  And then, as I said, in the entire second hour, plus, we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:06.128]  Early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[00:29:06.128 --> 00:29:14.515]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[00:29:14.515 --> 00:29:16.757]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[00:29:16.757 --> 00:29:23.603]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin, the final coin that we're putting out for a long time.
[00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:27.624]  Yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[00:29:40.114 --> 00:29:40.995]  We're good to go.
[00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:07.151]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.

[00:30:18.155 --> 00:30:26.718]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.

[00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.913]  You're not going to find tumor at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[00:31:42.913 --> 00:31:45.575]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[00:31:45.575 --> 00:31:51.678]  These similar formulas, or the same formulas, sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[00:31:51.678 --> 00:31:53.119]  InfoWars MD.
[00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:56.061]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:56.061 --> 00:31:56.741]  A true 360 win.

[00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:32.875]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[00:32:32.875 --> 00:32:36.998]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:40.060]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.481]  They're all different formulas.
[00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:45.564]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[00:32:45.564 --> 00:32:46.805]  So down and out.
[00:32:46.805 --> 00:32:48.025]  Sold out for more than five months.
[00:32:48.025 --> 00:32:50.867]  It's now back available at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:33:02.155 --> 00:33:08.039]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.686 --> 00:33:33.173]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:33.173 --> 00:33:37.900]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.133 --> 00:33:44.815]  Therefore, I've said already in the last days.
[00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:47.977]  Yes, we have to do more to defend Ukraine.
[00:33:47.977 --> 00:33:51.119]  Yes, we have to do more also on tanks.
[00:33:51.119 --> 00:34:05.869]  But the most important and the crucial part is that we do it together and that we do not do the blame game in Europe because we are fighting a war against Russia and not against each other.
[00:34:05.869 --> 00:34:07.710]  Thank you.
[00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:08.611]  Thank you, Madam Minister.
[00:34:12.344 --> 00:34:16.527]  Well, humanity's decided with our globalist leaders that it's time for nuclear war!
[00:34:16.527 --> 00:34:19.129]  I'm gonna give the number out next segment.
[00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:24.454]  We'll take calls in the second hour.
[00:34:24.454 --> 00:34:28.997]  Into the third hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:28.997 --> 00:34:30.798]  I'd particularly like to hear from veterans.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.520]  But we'll talk to everybody.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.281]  We'd love to hear from all of you.
[00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:40.301]  We'll put veterans to the front of the line.
[00:34:40.301 --> 00:34:42.242]  So start your engines, folks.
[00:34:42.242 --> 00:34:47.583]  I'll be giving the number out coming up at the end of this segment.
[00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:49.963]  But I need to look at the attack on humanity.
[00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:51.783]  And again, I want to explain something.
[00:34:51.783 --> 00:34:53.544]  Our military is full of really good people.
[00:34:53.544 --> 00:34:54.524]  That's why they've been purging it.
[00:34:54.524 --> 00:35:01.025]  That's why they've been making it not a human military, but an autonomous AI
[00:35:02.568 --> 00:35:07.493]  Globalist controlled military.
[00:35:07.493 --> 00:35:08.854]  And so let's go through some of these headlines.
[00:35:08.854 --> 00:35:10.415]  I'm going to play these clips.
[00:35:10.415 --> 00:35:11.096]  Kick in the face.
[00:35:11.096 --> 00:35:16.161]  Soldiers fired for refusing COVID vaccine forced to pay back signing bonuses.
[00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:19.144]  One service member said he got a $7,000 bonus for signing up for six years.
[00:35:19.144 --> 00:35:21.586]  He was asked to pay back $4,000 of it.
[00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:22.427]  It goes on from there.
[00:35:22.427 --> 00:35:23.548]  The Pentagon admits they're doing it.
[00:35:24.892 --> 00:35:29.233]  Bill Gates is in Australia flying around in a $70 million jet telling people they can't have a car.
[00:35:29.233 --> 00:35:34.914]  He warns Australia the next pandemic is just around the corner and will be man-made.
[00:35:34.914 --> 00:35:40.296]  Well, this one was man-made and it's now conclusively come out that that's the case.
[00:35:40.296 --> 00:35:52.799]  And we're going to play a clip again after we play some of these Bill Gates clips of Fauci lying to Congress over and over again saying there's no gain of function when he ran programs called gain of function in the literature
[00:35:53.616 --> 00:36:00.225]  And they now know that they made COVID-19.
[00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:04.010]  Let's go ahead and play clip 20.
[00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.674]  The current vaccines are not infection blocking.
[00:36:07.446 --> 00:36:09.767]  But despite that, there's a new ad running with Martha Stewart.
[00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:10.948]  I guess she is a criminal after all.
[00:36:35.765 --> 00:36:39.086]  Telling you that if you take it, you're 100% protected.
[00:36:39.086 --> 00:36:45.189]  So the guys that own the companies that have made the hundreds of billions, that are ripping us off, that are killing us, they're telling us that doesn't protect you.
[00:36:45.189 --> 00:36:53.272]  But they're running TV ads where she's running around with a samurai sword, telling you that she got boosted.
[00:36:53.272 --> 00:36:59.535]  Here it is.
[00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:03.196]  You know that unwelcome guest everyone wishes would just leave already?
[00:37:03.196 --> 00:37:03.697]  That's COVID-19.
[00:37:07.407 --> 00:37:15.673]  That's why I got the new updated booster, designed to help protect against recent Omicron variants.
[00:37:15.673 --> 00:37:23.259]  Got it.
[00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:27.282]  So you have Pfizer and BioNTech, the Moderna shot.
[00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:39.029]  With government websites telling you that this protects you when they know the boosters lower your immunity more, make you get sick more, make you die more.
[00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:41.211]  That's mainline news.
[00:37:41.211 --> 00:37:46.315]  But they got a convicted criminal up there, Martha Stewart, who I said got railroaded.
[00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.651]  But now she is a criminal.
[00:37:48.651 --> 00:37:50.212]  So burn in hell, Martha Stewart.
[00:37:50.212 --> 00:37:54.414]  Why don't you go crawl back in your prison cell, you lying monster.
[00:37:54.414 --> 00:38:02.378]  And any of these people taking money from these folks, and most of these big talk shows are, are complicit in Nuremberg-level crimes.
[00:38:02.378 --> 00:38:11.382]  Now let's go to a clip of Bill Gates two and a half years ago saying, the next pandemic will be worse and terrorists are going to release it with Stephen Colbert.
[00:38:11.382 --> 00:38:13.583]  Well, I mean, he knows who the terrorists are.
[00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:14.104]  It's him.
[00:38:14.104 --> 00:38:14.444]  Here it is.
[00:38:16.098 --> 00:38:20.462]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[00:38:20.462 --> 00:38:21.703]  Well, the...
[00:38:23.058 --> 00:38:30.880]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because there, a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:50.426]  Now the good news is, not trying to depress you, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism.
[00:38:55.535 --> 00:39:02.579]  Yep, always good to know he had that to say.
[00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:05.421]  Absolutely insane.
[00:39:05.421 --> 00:39:06.442]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:39:06.442 --> 00:39:10.124]  Now let's play this little compilation of Fauci.
[00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:30.475]  Very, very important clip of Fauci saying that there isn't gain of function, and then now even mainstream media, knowing all the documents that are out there, is admitting that there is gain of function.
[00:39:30.475 --> 00:39:34.317]  That's clip 23.
[00:39:34.317 --> 00:39:36.838]  Where are the line to Congress charges on this guy?
[00:39:37.844 --> 00:39:42.606]  Because I can play Euclid's M on C-Span four years ago saying they're funding gain-of-function and admitting it.
[00:39:42.606 --> 00:39:43.986]  It's all on record.
[00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:47.668]  Again, he ran conferences called in support of gain-of-function.
[00:39:47.668 --> 00:39:48.748]  He funded gain-of-function.
[00:39:48.748 --> 00:39:50.129]  He's the king of gain-of-function.
[00:39:50.129 --> 00:39:50.489]  Here it is.
[00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:54.291]  I don't know how many times I can say it, Madam Chair.
[00:39:54.291 --> 00:40:00.113]  We did not fund gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:07.404]  In our Health Lead, we now know that a bat coronavirus was enhanced in a lab.
[00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:17.809]  NIH and NIAID categorically has not funded gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute.
[00:40:17.809 --> 00:40:25.352]  The National Institutes of Health acknowledged that it funded research of a virus that was studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:30.175]  The experiment unexpectedly, we're told, made a bat coronavirus more contagious
[00:40:30.715 --> 00:40:33.218]  Then the original naturally occurring one.
[00:40:33.218 --> 00:40:43.552]  Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[00:40:44.938 --> 00:40:51.961]  Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement.
[00:40:51.961 --> 00:40:56.404]  A new letter raising questions about experiments in a Wuhan lab.
[00:40:56.404 --> 00:40:57.144]  Let me finish.
[00:40:57.144 --> 00:41:02.547]  You take an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans, you're saying that's not gain of function?
[00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:03.887]  That is correct.
[00:41:03.887 --> 00:41:08.209]  And Senator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly.
[00:41:08.209 --> 00:41:10.611]  And I want to say that officially.
[00:41:10.611 --> 00:41:13.192]  You do not know what you are talking about.
[00:41:14.032 --> 00:41:24.080]  For years, the National Institutes of Health provided grant money to the EcoHealth Alliance Research Group, which conducted experiments with bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, China.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.404]  And if anybody is lying to you, Senator, it is you!
[00:41:28.404 --> 00:41:30.005]  That's what you are getting.
[00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:30.906]  Let me finish.
[00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:31.746]  We don't know.
[00:41:31.746 --> 00:41:32.587]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:41:32.587 --> 00:41:40.153]  It did come to the lab, but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab, and there will be responsibility for those who funded the lab, including yourself.
[00:41:40.213 --> 00:41:49.958]  The National Institute of Health admitted this week that it funded controversial gain-of-function research using coronaviruses at a lab in China at the epicenter of the pandemic.
[00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:55.781]  Contradicting claims send Dr. Anthony Fauci that American tax dollars never paid for that kind of research.
[00:41:55.781 --> 00:41:57.662]  I have not lied before Congress.
[00:41:57.662 --> 00:42:01.084]  I have never lied, certainly not before Congress.
[00:42:01.084 --> 00:42:03.125]  Case closed.
[00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:05.507]  It is a thousand times worse than even that report.
[00:42:06.496 --> 00:42:06.676]  Yeah.
[00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.533]  They had made vaccine before, before COVID was released, because that's what it is.
[00:42:25.533 --> 00:42:26.833]  They even named it COVID-19.
[00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:28.294]  They had the damn thing ready.
[00:42:28.294 --> 00:42:31.376]  That's how they went, oh, we made it in two days in February of 2020.
[00:42:31.376 --> 00:42:34.218]  We just made it in two days.
[00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.038]  They had tested it.
[00:42:35.038 --> 00:42:35.539]  They'd done it.
[00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:40.141]  The damn Pentagon ran it with Obama to kill the American people and our troops.
[00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:42.583]  And we're sitting there with that murderer up there.
[00:42:42.583 --> 00:42:46.145]  It just blows my mind how bold these people are.
[00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:50.609]  I got a clip of Fauci that I don't want you to see when we come back.
[00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:55.356]  Where he's up there bragging how they're gonna blow up the health system and get rid of drugs being tested.
[00:42:55.356 --> 00:42:56.298]  We're gonna play that straight ahead.
[00:42:59.889 --> 00:43:04.612]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[00:43:04.612 --> 00:43:09.815]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[00:43:09.815 --> 00:43:14.657]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[00:43:14.657 --> 00:43:19.000]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:29.127]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento, so you can remember the great contribution you've made to freedom.
[00:43:29.127 --> 00:43:42.138]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last, at 1776coin.com.
[00:43:42.138 --> 00:43:45.921]  And just like an NPR pledge drive, where they mark up a coffee cup, or a t-shirt, or a DVD,
[00:43:46.942 --> 00:43:47.522]  300%.
[00:43:47.522 --> 00:43:50.627]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:55.073]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on WhatCoinsRemain.
[00:43:55.073 --> 00:43:56.915]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[00:43:59.784 --> 00:44:03.188]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[00:44:03.188 --> 00:44:05.951]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:44:05.951 --> 00:44:08.694]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:44:08.694 --> 00:44:09.975]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:44:09.975 --> 00:44:13.899]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:44:13.899 --> 00:44:18.785]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:44:19.085 --> 00:44:25.249]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:44:25.249 --> 00:44:33.955]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:44:33.955 --> 00:44:39.578]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:44:39.578 --> 00:44:45.002]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:44:45.222 --> 00:44:47.703]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:44:47.703 --> 00:44:50.425]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:44:50.425 --> 00:44:51.886]  So go check out the store.
[00:44:51.886 --> 00:44:53.086]  Go support their store.
[00:44:53.086 --> 00:44:54.307]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:44:54.307 --> 00:44:55.948]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:44:55.948 --> 00:44:59.990]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.352]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[00:45:03.352 --> 00:45:12.257]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:21.111]  But through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[00:45:21.111 --> 00:45:26.234]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.
[00:45:26.234 --> 00:45:28.615]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[00:45:28.615 --> 00:45:32.378]  It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoWars4.com.
[00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:46.305]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:46.305 --> 00:45:53.408]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:45:53.408 --> 00:45:58.551]  Yield it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[00:45:59.975 --> 00:46:04.496]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[00:46:04.496 --> 00:46:16.939]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[00:46:16.939 --> 00:46:18.120]  These are high-end.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.200]  These are the very best.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.001]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[00:46:22.001 --> 00:46:22.521]  Well guess what?
[00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:28.282]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[00:46:28.282 --> 00:46:30.923]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[00:46:30.923 --> 00:46:37.804]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.
[00:46:37.804 --> 00:46:43.006]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:43.006 --> 00:46:43.986]  The highest quality.
[00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:53.070]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[00:46:53.070 --> 00:47:01.354]  M4 Wars MD at m4warsstore.com.
[00:47:01.354 --> 00:47:07.257]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:16.388 --> 00:47:20.993]  Final segment of hour number one, hour number two, three, and four, ahead of The War Room at 3 p.m.
[00:47:20.993 --> 00:47:25.257]  Central, with the great Owen Schroer, coming up.
[00:47:25.257 --> 00:47:29.180]  Infowars.com, Ford Slot Show, The Coordinates of Liberty, Bandai Video, and so much more.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.922]  I want to thank all of our affiliates out there.
[00:47:30.922 --> 00:47:33.585]  Please spread the word about those as well, listeners, and support them.
[00:47:34.321 --> 00:47:39.682]  Okay, I'm going to finish up on the poison shots and not get into it anymore today because I've covered it a lot, but it really is central.
[00:47:39.682 --> 00:47:46.764]  We're going to cover World War III, already starting, already happening, and all those developments, and open phones next hour into the third hour.
[00:47:46.764 --> 00:47:51.845]  Then a special guest is with us for part of the third hour in studio.
[00:47:51.845 --> 00:47:59.466]  Into the fourth hour, but we need to really pull back here and understand something.
[00:47:59.466 --> 00:48:01.707]  I can't take on the new world order without your support.
[00:48:02.751 --> 00:48:06.614]  And I am so blessed and honored that God put me in this position.
[00:48:06.614 --> 00:48:13.158]  And I'm so thankful, humbly to you, that you have put up with me over the years, because Lord knows I don't do a perfect job.
[00:48:13.158 --> 00:48:17.261]  Sometimes I can't stand what I've done in the past, but I did it all for good.
[00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:20.723]  But overall, we've done so much good work together.
[00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:25.686]  And we are right there at break even right now in this operation.
[00:48:25.686 --> 00:48:28.068]  And I want to be able to do more.
[00:48:28.068 --> 00:48:30.810]  I want to go out and cover live events and reach tens of millions of people.
[00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.031]  I want to be able to stay on air.
[00:48:33.412 --> 00:48:36.895]  I don't want to be spending five, six hours a day just trying to get funds to operate this place.
[00:48:36.895 --> 00:48:42.099]  So you can make it so easy to keep us on air with your action, with your will, with your decision to take action.
[00:48:42.099 --> 00:48:45.041]  Plus, these are really amazing products.
[00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.883]  Everybody knows the last decade, bone broth.
[00:48:48.604 --> 00:48:53.006]  Became one of the top best-selling, not even supplements, but just items at the store.
[00:48:53.006 --> 00:48:59.410]  Because good, concentrated chicken broth, particularly, is so good for your joints, your immune system, your whole body.
[00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:04.152]  That's why grandma would boil down a chicken with the bones in it when you had the flu or a cold.
[00:49:04.152 --> 00:49:11.036]  Everybody knows it just does something magic when grandma or mama makes you that special chicken bone soup.
[00:49:11.036 --> 00:49:14.477]  There are good bone broths that come from beef, but the study says it's not as good.
[00:49:14.477 --> 00:49:17.359]  We have a top-flight system that has very strong
[00:49:18.891 --> 00:49:30.614]  Concentrate of chicken broth, but that's only one ingredient in our ultimate bone broth that's finally after two plus years back in stock and now updated even better.
[00:49:30.614 --> 00:49:38.775]  It's got the original chicken broth concentrate, the original high quality turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, the goji berry, the alfalfa herb powder.
[00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:41.076]  Now it's got five grams of organic soluble
[00:49:42.409 --> 00:49:43.130]  See you next time!
[00:49:53.422 --> 00:50:03.450]  Added electrolytes to help recover from exercise like magnesium, real organic cocoa, bean butter and natural chocolate flavor, and a touch of sea salt.
[00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:07.934]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[00:50:07.934 --> 00:50:10.436]  It's time to take advantage of the big savings.
[00:50:10.436 --> 00:50:12.478]  It's 25% off back at stop.
[00:50:12.478 --> 00:50:16.021]  Updated formula with ultimate bone broth and in full wars life.
[00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:21.025]  So go to mfoilworkstore.com and get your Ultimate Bone Broth Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:50:21.025 --> 00:50:23.547]  Also one of our old classic best brands.
[00:50:23.547 --> 00:50:24.989]  Sold out for over two years.
[00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:28.492]  Couldn't get it because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.174]  We wouldn't lower the quality of the formula.
[00:50:30.174 --> 00:50:31.175]  Talk about Fountain of Youth.
[00:50:31.175 --> 00:50:32.316]  It's as close as you're going to get to it.
[00:50:33.154 --> 00:50:39.299]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients, but the Prentolin alone and the trace elements in it do incredible things for your body.
[00:50:39.299 --> 00:50:44.583]  It takes a few weeks for the super strong effects to kick in, a few days to feel the difference.
[00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:51.109]  Real Red Pill, 50% off, Infowarshore.com, but it's selling out quick, so we're going to have to go back to 25% off very, very quick.
[00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:52.370]  It will be sold out in just a few weeks.
[00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:57.914]  Also, other great products like Testosterone Boost, 1776 Testosterone Boost is incredible.
[00:50:57.914 --> 00:51:01.617]  Enforce Platinum Line and of course PainMD, Enforce Platinum Line.
[00:51:01.617 --> 00:51:05.541]  Those are both 40% off, but those are close to selling out.
[00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:09.985]  Just like we don't have the HGH Max Boost anymore because it's sold out.
[00:51:09.985 --> 00:51:11.266]  So these will sell out very quickly.
[00:51:11.266 --> 00:51:14.008]  So they're going to go to 25% off in about a week or so.
[00:51:14.008 --> 00:51:16.610]  So if you want to get 40% off, I'd do that now on 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:51:18.692 --> 00:51:20.075]  And of course, PayneMD.
[00:51:20.075 --> 00:51:23.823]  Both private labels of already number one best selling products by a big company.
[00:51:23.823 --> 00:51:26.148]  There are fans that let us private label these.
[00:51:26.148 --> 00:51:27.631]  We're very, very thankful to that.
[00:51:27.631 --> 00:51:29.254]  A real blessing.
[00:51:29.254 --> 00:51:29.575]  All right.
[00:51:30.814 --> 00:51:33.316]  Let's finish up with the deadly shots here, folks.
[00:51:33.316 --> 00:51:42.803]  There's so many of these clips, I won't get to them all, but the false advertising on Sesame Street with Elmo saying, take the shots, kids, it protects you!
[00:51:42.803 --> 00:51:46.286]  I mean, it's truly evil that they're doing this.
[00:51:46.286 --> 00:51:54.572]  Truth Justice tweets, we played this several times a year or two ago, but I want to remind you of this, for those that are tuning that don't know about it, the criminal plan
[00:51:55.805 --> 00:52:11.551]  Five months before the COVID pandemic was declared, Anthony Fauci met with the HHS Director of Biomedical Research, President of Global Immunization, and others on how to get the population to accept mRNA universal vaccines because a virus outbreak could occur in China.
[00:52:11.551 --> 00:52:20.535]  And there's other meetings three years before where they'd said it on C-SPAN too, and they had prepared the virus, they already had the so-called vaccine ready, we've covered all that.
[00:52:21.624 --> 00:52:23.525]  Years ago, but what's old is new.
[00:52:23.525 --> 00:52:28.207]  Now people are finally understanding and it's getting major, major traction.
[00:52:28.207 --> 00:52:32.810]  So it's a seven and a half minute excerpts of these guys in a two hour C-Span video.
[00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:41.514]  I'm going to have the full video posted at Infowars.com under the live show feed because I'm not going to have time to play the whole seven and a half minutes.
[00:52:41.514 --> 00:52:44.155]  But here's just a few minutes of it so you get the gist.
[00:52:44.155 --> 00:52:47.277]  This is them talking like they're the adults at Thanksgiving at the big table.
[00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:52.923]  They're talking about insurance policies, or cancer, or baseball games.
[00:52:52.923 --> 00:52:54.164]  Stuff the kids don't know.
[00:52:54.164 --> 00:52:58.225]  The kids are over there talking about Power Rangers, or you know, G.I.
[00:52:58.225 --> 00:53:04.748]  Joe, or whatever the kids are... I guess the kids are there talking about learning how to blowjobs and have their penises cut off.
[00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:14.873]  But the point is, the kids are over here discussing how they're having sex with pedophiles, because the school is raping them or whatever, and the parents are over here talking about the quote, adult stuff,
[00:53:15.433 --> 00:53:19.939]  Here they are at the parent table talking about all this like we're not listening.
[00:53:19.939 --> 00:53:23.644]  How they plan the whole damn thing to blow up the system so there's no more testing.
[00:53:23.644 --> 00:53:25.426]  They can just hit us with poison and get away with it.
[00:53:25.426 --> 00:53:25.727]  Here it is.
[00:53:26.474 --> 00:53:45.991]  So we really do have a problem of how the world perceives influenza and it's going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say, I don't care what your perception is, we're going to address the problem in a disruptive way and in an iterative way because you do need both.
[00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:53.698]  It is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere.
[00:54:00.114 --> 00:54:04.477]  We're talking about one of the greatest public health challenges of our lifetime.
[00:54:04.477 --> 00:54:06.979]  Every day, the pandemic clock is ticking.
[00:54:06.979 --> 00:54:13.103]  Flu is the thing on Earth that is most likely to kill many, many people.
[00:54:13.103 --> 00:54:14.143]  All right, that's enough.
[00:54:14.143 --> 00:54:15.544]  And it goes on.
[00:54:15.544 --> 00:54:23.429]  But what they wanted to do was repackage the flu, which is what this is, but it's been upgraded to sell you on the tyranny because it wasn't scaring you enough.
[00:54:23.429 --> 00:54:26.031]  Now, here's Dr. John Campbell.
[00:54:26.031 --> 00:54:28.233]  He's the biggest health reporter in England.
[00:54:29.147 --> 00:54:31.549]  He gets tens of millions of views a week.
[00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:32.289]  Highly respected.
[00:54:32.289 --> 00:54:34.331]  He supported the shot, all of it.
[00:54:34.331 --> 00:54:36.953]  And in the last six months, he's come out and said, I was lied to.
[00:54:36.953 --> 00:54:37.533]  I was wrong.
[00:54:37.533 --> 00:54:38.694]  I don't trust the government.
[00:54:38.694 --> 00:54:39.535]  This is on purpose.
[00:54:39.535 --> 00:54:41.516]  There's no way they didn't know this.
[00:54:41.516 --> 00:54:45.499]  They lied to all of us, just like Dr. Michael Yeadon said.
[00:54:45.499 --> 00:54:50.963]  He's a top expert, former head of Pfizer's whole operations with the vaccines, everything.
[00:54:50.963 --> 00:54:57.128]  He was on with us yesterday and he said, it's anybody in a first school, first year medical
[00:54:58.536 --> 00:55:06.143]  Just how long can the UK government and other governments and mainstream media keep on ignoring the huge amount of excess deaths that is around?
[00:55:06.143 --> 00:55:07.425]  It's just quite incredible.
[00:55:07.425 --> 00:55:09.466]  I'm going to be looking at data today from Europe.
[00:55:24.269 --> 00:55:28.835]  This is from Euro Mono Bulletin, and as we'll see, this is official European data.
[00:55:28.835 --> 00:55:31.438]  I'm going to show you this site in a minute.
[00:55:31.438 --> 00:55:36.163]  This week, pooled Euro Mono all cause mortality.
[00:55:36.163 --> 00:55:38.726]  Elevated levels of excess mortality.
[00:55:38.726 --> 00:55:43.292]  Overall, all around the place geographically and in all age groups.
[00:55:44.463 --> 00:55:47.004]  We'll be looking at age groups such as 0 to 14.
[00:55:47.004 --> 00:55:56.348]  Now, the Chief Medical Officer in the UK has said that the excess deaths are caused by people not being able to get their statins during the pandemic.
[00:55:56.348 --> 00:56:02.150]  Well, most 14-year-olds don't take statins, so I think we need to do a bit better than that, to be quite honest.
[00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.791]  Average levels from pre-2020.
[00:56:03.791 --> 00:56:06.192]  Now, the thing about the data I'm about to show you
[00:56:06.912 --> 00:56:07.012]  Yes.
[00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:29.516]  Increase
[00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:54.512]  And sometimes above the significant level as well.
[00:56:54.512 --> 00:56:58.814]  We've got 1,371 excess deaths in 0-14 year olds.
[00:56:58.814 --> 00:57:08.156]  These are huge amounts of deaths, so why have deaths in 0-14 year olds in these European countries been higher than we would expect for all of 2022?
[00:57:08.156 --> 00:57:10.677]  So it's all over.
[00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:14.498]  Significant increase in excess deaths throughout 2022 and the first weeks of 2020.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.020]  23.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:29.148]  Also, of course, as we've just said, from the European data, it's all over and in all age groups.
[00:57:29.148 --> 00:57:29.889]  Yep.
[00:57:29.889 --> 00:57:31.010]  And it's not from COVID.
[00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:32.811]  94% of the population's had it now.
[00:57:32.811 --> 00:57:34.373]  They're killing us with the shots.
[00:57:34.373 --> 00:57:35.974]  That's only a fraction is getting reported.
[00:57:35.974 --> 00:57:37.396]  It's far worse than that.
[00:57:37.396 --> 00:57:38.376]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[00:57:38.376 --> 00:57:38.537]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:57:38.537 --> 00:57:40.198]  We're taking calls on World War III exclusively.
[00:57:40.198 --> 00:57:40.899]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.339 --> 00:57:52.340]  Infowars has made history.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.961]  You have made history by supporting Infowars.
[00:57:54.961 --> 00:57:58.163]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[00:57:58.163 --> 00:58:01.605]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[00:58:01.605 --> 00:58:03.146]  Let's win the war.
[00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:04.927]  The information war.
[00:58:04.927 --> 00:58:06.888]  There's nothing you can do more important
[00:58:07.148 --> 00:58:08.009]  I don't think anybody

[00:58:50.294 --> 00:58:52.115]  InfoWars is winning.
[00:58:52.115 --> 00:58:54.176]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[00:58:54.176 --> 00:58:56.957]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[00:58:56.957 --> 00:58:59.698]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[00:58:59.698 --> 00:59:01.799]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:03.860]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.840]  None of that's true.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.721]  It's all being appealed.
[00:59:06.181 --> 00:59:15.166]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[00:59:15.166 --> 00:59:18.608]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[00:59:18.608 --> 00:59:21.310]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:31.216]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.

[00:59:41.519 --> 00:59:44.899]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[00:59:44.899 --> 00:59:46.860]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:53.082]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[00:59:53.082 --> 00:59:57.043]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:02.984 --> 01:00:04.986]  Alright, this is a short little five-minute segment.
[01:00:04.986 --> 01:00:07.649]  We're about to premiere a very important Gregory's Report.
[01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:15.076]  We're taking calls from long-time callers, first-time callers, callers that agree, callers that disagree on World War III, on the escalation in Russia.
[01:00:15.076 --> 01:00:15.937]  How do we stop it?
[01:00:15.937 --> 01:00:16.678]  Where is it going?
[01:00:16.678 --> 01:00:17.919]  What are the globalists thinking?
[01:00:17.919 --> 01:00:20.562]  That's a huge subject area and I want to really focus on it.
[01:00:20.562 --> 01:00:23.785]  I want to hear your views on it because I really respect them and it gets my mind.
[01:00:24.305 --> 01:00:26.888]  Really working on this and thinking about this to focus on it.
[01:00:26.888 --> 01:00:28.330]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:28.670]  877-789-Alex.
[01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.790]  877-789-2539.
[01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.375]  We're going to just move quick through your calls, so get ready, I'm coming right back to you.
[01:00:43.004 --> 01:00:45.468]  Here is the Gregory's Report, and we knew this was coming.
[01:00:45.468 --> 01:00:48.172]  They pre-programmed it in movies like Jurassic Park.
[01:00:48.172 --> 01:00:53.539]  CIA funding company to resurrect extinct animals under the guise of climate change.
[01:00:53.539 --> 01:00:57.766]  It's really getting you ready for a bunch of new chimeric creatures that are actually new, but here it is.
[01:01:04.557 --> 01:01:14.024]  Colossal Biosciences is using CRISPR gene editing technology to resurrect animals that have gone extinct.
[01:01:14.024 --> 01:01:20.208]  They are starting next year with a woolly mammoth and are making plans for the Tasmanian tiger.
[01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:25.912]  The plan is to release 100 woolly mammoths inside a park in Siberia.
[01:01:26.472 --> 01:01:30.916]  This is officially being done under the guise of climate change.
[01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:38.143]  They claim that by adding megafauna back into the Arctic tundra, it will offset carbon emissions.
[01:01:38.143 --> 01:01:45.369]  The company has already raised over 12 million euros, which includes funding from the CIA.
[01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:52.035]  The CIA's venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel, is a stakeholder of Colossal Biosciences.
[01:01:53.116 --> 01:02:04.158]  Euronews points out that the plan seems counterproductive, seeing as how over 30% of trees worldwide are currently going extinct.
[01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:11.740]  And points out its potential dangers of introducing ancient, unknown pathogens into our modern world.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:21.922]  But when you look into the company's co-founder, George Church, it becomes clear that it's really all about pushing the agenda of human cloning and transhumanism.
[01:02:22.722 --> 01:02:42.477]  Harvard scientist George Church received donations from 2005 to 2007 from Jeffrey Epstein, the infamous pedophile transhumanist who was planning on establishing a baby farm at his New Mexico ranch to seed the earth with his DNA.
[01:02:42.477 --> 01:02:50.023]  In 2019, Church awkwardly apologized for his association with Jeffrey Epstein on 60 Minutes.
[01:02:50.023 --> 01:02:51.204]  It was one of these things where
[01:02:51.905 --> 01:03:00.196]  You first learn about it and it's not, it's just like, when you first hear about it, it doesn't sound like it's something serious.
[01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:07.006]  And it's only recently that we've found out that it was something serious, or become aware how serious it was.
[01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:18.290]  The professional connection between Jeffrey Epstein and George Church was their common desire to clone humans, which is something that Church is most passionate about.
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:30.334]  His work has been focused primarily on creating superior humans and wants to bring Neanderthal man back from extinction and give them their own culture and political force.
[01:03:31.154 --> 01:03:40.337]  He is also passionate about creating customized living creatures out of DNA to serve mankind as we see fit.
[01:03:40.337 --> 01:03:53.162]  When asked if he believed in God, Church responded that he respects all people's faith, but his faith is in science, and that the true understanding of nature is only available to the scientists.
[01:03:54.062 --> 01:04:04.188]  This psychopathy that has infected man with an obsession to play God has attracted many atheists into the field of genetic engineering.
[01:04:04.188 --> 01:04:07.509]  But not everyone in this field wants to play God.
[01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:13.132]  Dr. Bruce Lipton was a pioneer in the research of cloned human stem cells.
[01:04:13.132 --> 01:04:21.557]  His research revealed that the environment and our perception of the environment is what controls our genetic activity.
[01:04:22.117 --> 01:04:30.743]  This is known as epigenetics, and as a result of his research, he stopped being an atheist and found faith in God.
[01:04:30.743 --> 01:04:40.669]  This, and the nature of his research, has alienated him from today's scientific community, which seeks to destroy nature and control it.
[01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:45.251]  But you can still find his work, and I recommend that you do.
[01:04:45.251 --> 01:04:47.513]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:02.364]  InfoWars has made history.
[01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:05.006]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[01:05:05.006 --> 01:05:08.188]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[01:05:08.188 --> 01:05:11.630]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.172]  Let's win the war.
[01:05:13.172 --> 01:05:14.953]  The information war.
[01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:19.717]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping InfoWars on air and the fight for liberty.
[01:05:19.717 --> 01:05:21.518]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:33.464]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[01:06:11.989 --> 01:06:14.652]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:14.652 --> 01:06:16.093]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:40.352]  Well, they got Germany to announce that they're shipping 84 heavy battle tanks into Ukraine for the war with Russia.
[01:06:40.352 --> 01:06:47.316]  Biden just announced the first tranche, 30 Abrams battle tanks into Ukraine to fight Russia.
[01:06:47.316 --> 01:06:48.577]  The U.S.
[01:06:48.577 --> 01:06:54.560]  is sending hundreds and hundreds of other armored vehicles in and high-tech weapons as well.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.482]  Russia has said they're at war with the United States.
[01:06:57.529 --> 01:07:06.299]  Germany's foreign minister said, we played the clip twice last hour, that they are at war with Russia.
[01:07:06.299 --> 01:07:11.445]  And so where Napoleon went and where Hitler went, we now go.
[01:07:12.819 --> 01:07:19.485]  The nine-year program by George Soros and the Deep State bragging on CNN with Fareed Zakaria five years ago.
[01:07:19.485 --> 01:07:34.877]  He bragged that then four years before that, now nine years ago, that they got $5 billion of State Department money with Victoria Newland to overthrow the elected government of Ukraine and then start the proxy war with the Russians that they've now been
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.183]  Learned into and I wish the Russians wouldn't have done it.
[01:07:38.183 --> 01:07:43.032]  I don't support their Invasion as well, but it's a slavic civil war and this is insane
[01:07:44.175 --> 01:07:46.176]  This is not going into Iraq.
[01:07:46.176 --> 01:07:47.436]  This is not going into Afghanistan.
[01:07:47.436 --> 01:07:49.277]  It's bad enough.
[01:07:49.277 --> 01:07:55.660]  This is going up against the second largest nuclear power in the world and is completely out of control.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:04.444]  But it's all happening because we're ending the end of the dollar hegemony and a new global currency is coming in.
[01:08:04.444 --> 01:08:07.746]  Regional currencies will still be there, but they'll be digital and tried to control.
[01:08:07.746 --> 01:08:10.707]  Here's the M2 money supply.
[01:08:12.145 --> 01:08:15.767]  And it's similar numbers across the world, but the central bankers are coordinating it.
[01:08:15.767 --> 01:08:20.930]  Look how much money they gave themselves in just the last five years.
[01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:30.015]  They jacked it up to more money being printed and more money being put out digitally than had been put out in the last 50 years.
[01:08:30.015 --> 01:08:31.276]  More money.
[01:08:31.276 --> 01:08:35.358]  They put out over 50% of U.S.
[01:08:35.358 --> 01:08:40.861]  dollars ever produced in just the last few years under Biden.
[01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:43.015]  But you notice what they just did.
[01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:46.217]  They cut the money spigot off.
[01:08:46.217 --> 01:08:51.862]  They gave the central banks quadrillions to buy up all the infrastructure, and then to the general public, they just turned it off.
[01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.343]  You see how they do that?
[01:08:53.343 --> 01:08:59.748]  They jack it up for themselves, consolidate power, vertically integrate, and then, boom, cut your money off.
[01:08:59.748 --> 01:09:02.731]  You're going into a depression.
[01:09:02.731 --> 01:09:04.252]  They don't tell you it's gone down to zero.
[01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:09.276]  And then they start a war as a smoke screen for it and release a virus.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:33.707]  Couple years ago to get you ready for martial law right before they release the virus right before They turn the money off And they flatline everybody you see the last time They got anywhere near this Every time they've done this
[01:09:35.785 --> 01:09:43.588]  In times like 2008, just dropping a fraction of what they've done, it causes a massive recession and a stock market crash.
[01:09:43.588 --> 01:09:46.809]  You can see the other times in history when they've done the same phenomenon.
[01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:51.071]  So, you look at that graph, that's bad.
[01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:52.411]  That is bad.
[01:09:52.411 --> 01:09:56.193]  Here's a big shot of the graph.
[01:09:56.193 --> 01:10:00.414]  And do they have the IRS going after the one-tenth of one percent, that's 70% of the wealth roughly?
[01:10:00.414 --> 01:10:01.935]  No, no, no, no.
[01:10:01.935 --> 01:10:03.675]  There's a couple hundred IRS agents for them.
[01:10:05.763 --> 01:10:13.371]  A hundred thousand different agents for people making $41,000 or less, even though they pay around 6% of the taxes.
[01:10:13.371 --> 01:10:19.837]  So let's harass the people that don't pay the taxes, so they give up on welfare and go on drugs and die of fentanyl.
[01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:22.460]  If you want a policy to destroy civilization, they've done it.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.325]  So we talk about war, we talk about nuclear war, we talk about kinetic war, we talk about escalation of war.
[01:10:29.133 --> 01:10:43.821]  The people running the war against Russia are running all these attacks against us with open borders and fentanyl and drag queen pedophile time funded by Disney and all the rest of them and the economic warfare and the list just goes on and on.
[01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:45.401]  It is disgusting.
[01:10:45.401 --> 01:10:51.525]  And what I want to say before I go to your calls is serving the New World Order should not be a circular firing squad.
[01:10:51.525 --> 01:10:53.806]  It should not be a suicide pact.
[01:10:54.704 --> 01:10:57.965]  You know, Governor Newsom gave a CBS News interview a few days ago.
[01:10:57.965 --> 01:10:59.085]  He got ridiculed by the reporter.
[01:10:59.085 --> 01:10:59.705]  It was NBC.
[01:10:59.705 --> 01:11:00.965]  I never got to the clip, but I saw the clip.
[01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:07.626]  In fact, since I managed to get the Newsom clip from two days ago, Newsom says that the Second Amendment is not a suicide pact.
[01:11:07.626 --> 01:11:14.068]  While he's got, in the report, five armed guards behind him, and the camera pans out, there's like six or seven more.
[01:11:14.068 --> 01:11:16.328]  So he's got armed men all around him.
[01:11:16.328 --> 01:11:20.089]  He's got armed men in his house.
[01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:20.869]  With armored vehicles.
[01:11:22.105 --> 01:11:24.846]  And I mean, I think in this day and age, a governor does need that.
[01:11:24.846 --> 01:11:34.050]  But the point is, little old us at my house, I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive.
[01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:41.794]  And, you know, if you come to my house as some criminal or some Antifa group, that's what Twitter said I was finally banned for.
[01:11:41.794 --> 01:11:44.095]  Twitter had gone to Tucker Carlson's house.
[01:11:44.095 --> 01:11:45.836]  Antifa was threatening to come to my house.
[01:11:45.836 --> 01:11:49.518]  Antifa went to Owen's house and put notes on his door, okay?
[01:11:49.518 --> 01:11:50.258]  Owen talked about it.
[01:11:51.656 --> 01:11:57.841]  And I just said, listen, you need to get your battle rifles ready.
[01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:04.407]  And you need to get your shotguns ready, have them in a secure place, because Antifa is saying they're going to come to our houses at night and kill us!
[01:12:07.728 --> 01:12:10.410]  And they said, oh my God, you can't say that.
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.431]  Alex Jones is banned.
[01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:12.472]  That's what I was banned for.
[01:12:12.472 --> 01:12:13.593]  Not Sandy Hook.
[01:12:13.593 --> 01:12:14.794]  I barely even talked about that.
[01:12:14.794 --> 01:12:15.855]  That wasn't an issue then.
[01:12:15.855 --> 01:12:28.265]  A PR firm run by the Democrats blew all that up, made it a huge deal, put it in the news, said I was saying things I didn't say or out of context as the excuse to then finally take me off the air or take me off many places.
[01:12:28.265 --> 01:12:29.987]  But the reason I'm going over this history is
[01:12:31.394 --> 01:12:39.841]  There are many ways for these people to attack you, and the people that run our country have cut our energy off, they are destroying our culture, they're creating racial division.
[01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:46.906]  I mean, I got several clips of this at universities and mainstream news with a straight face.
[01:12:46.906 --> 01:12:53.452]  Remember you heard by BuzzFeed like five years ago that milk is racist because it's white?
[01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.313]  Anything giving support to the color white?
[01:12:55.313 --> 01:12:58.716]  Hey, little newsflash, white isn't a color, it's devoid of color.
[01:12:59.847 --> 01:13:03.268]  White reflects all light.
[01:13:03.268 --> 01:13:05.289]  Black absorbs light.
[01:13:05.289 --> 01:13:11.090]  So black is absorption of color, and white is reflection of all color.
[01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:13.811]  That's why the sun looks white up at high noon.
[01:13:13.811 --> 01:13:16.952]  That is, it sets into the dust cloud on the horizon.
[01:13:16.952 --> 01:13:25.715]  It turns orange and then red as you're looking through all that dust on the elliptical, not straight up at it.
[01:13:25.715 --> 01:13:27.015]  But the point is, as I digress,
[01:13:28.558 --> 01:13:36.090]  A government-funded study asked if white paint prompted worldwide wicked whiteness.
[01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:41.498]  And it goes on to say that we don't want white picket fences or white buildings because they're soothing and nice.
[01:13:41.498 --> 01:13:42.200]  They're racist.
[01:13:43.965 --> 01:14:03.201]  A study on whiteness in paint, dubbed Norwhite, observes the Norwegian development of paint pigment titanium, white through historical, aesthetic, and critical lens, determine how the development of the color contributed to social transformation, as well as the innovation led to planetary consequences.
[01:14:03.201 --> 01:14:07.125]  White paint is racist, white paint is evil, white paint is bad.
[01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:12.049]  Of course, why would people in Norway be attracted to white?
[01:14:13.973 --> 01:14:25.096]  Because when you live in a country with almost no sunlight many parts of the year, they have studies that in Norway and Sweden they have rooms and they now broadcast fake sunlight and have paint that reflects it.
[01:14:25.096 --> 01:14:27.376]  In the offices they found it made suicide go way down.
[01:14:27.376 --> 01:14:39.879]  They had the highest suicide rates in Northern Europe, I mean in the world, because they weren't getting any sunshine and the eyes pick it up, the optic nerve, you get upset if you're not getting sunshine because humans are not nocturnal.
[01:14:41.001 --> 01:14:44.542]  Humans are up and operative during the day.
[01:14:44.542 --> 01:14:54.246]  And we're, Northern Europeans and Northerners have blue eyes and have better night vision because they're meant to absorb more light.
[01:14:54.246 --> 01:14:56.887]  And they live in more darkness.
[01:14:56.887 --> 01:15:00.148]  That's why my eyesight, after I'm outside for 20 minutes, it's like super dark.
[01:15:00.148 --> 01:15:01.969]  I can see like night vision.
[01:15:01.969 --> 01:15:05.910]  And that's because I have Northern European genetics in my eyes.
[01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:07.411]  And then as you go forward towards the equator,
[01:15:08.322 --> 01:15:12.085]  There's less of that because you don't want more light gathering.
[01:15:12.085 --> 01:15:14.707]  But I digress into science.
[01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:17.429]  Now white fences are bad and then I've got this clip.
[01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:19.651]  I'm going to go to your calls and come back.
[01:15:19.651 --> 01:15:26.036]  Michigan school board member doubles down on whiteness is evil and says, no it's true, whites are inherently bad and the left claps.
[01:15:26.036 --> 01:15:27.978]  These people are trying to destroy us.
[01:15:27.978 --> 01:15:30.980]  I don't mean the black people that bought into this crap, I mean the globalists.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.722]  This is preposterous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:33.683 --> 01:15:37.827]  But it doesn't mean if a big group of racist black people are coming after you, you don't have a right to defend yourself.
[01:15:37.827 --> 01:15:48.035]  Whether the KKK is coming to some black person's house to lynch him, or a bunch of blacks are trying to beat up and kill a white person, defend yourself with lethal force, ladies and gentlemen, whether you're black or white, no matter who's attacking you.
[01:15:48.035 --> 01:15:51.699]  We're gonna go right to your calls, I promise, on World War III, when we come back.
[01:15:51.699 --> 01:15:57.624]  Johnny, Eric, Laura, John, Peter, Tim, Electric Eye, Terry, Marvin, Hopper!
[01:15:59.423 --> 01:16:05.464]  Early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[01:16:05.464 --> 01:16:13.846]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[01:16:13.846 --> 01:16:16.086]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[01:16:16.086 --> 01:16:19.567]  Now that was a three-coin series, the founding member coin.
[01:16:19.567 --> 01:16:22.928]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[01:16:23.668 --> 01:16:30.335]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:36.162]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[01:16:36.162 --> 01:16:39.405]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[01:16:39.585 --> 01:16:40.326]  We're good to go.
[01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:02.147]  InfoWars MD is finally here.

[01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:02.153]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[01:18:02.153 --> 01:18:18.845]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.

[01:18:48.085 --> 01:18:55.090]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com with massive, massive savings.
[01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:05.193]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[01:19:05.193 --> 01:19:18.177]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting infowarestore.com right now and taking action.
[01:19:18.177 --> 01:19:23.139]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.200]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.501]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:28.961]  They're coming for you and your family.
[01:19:28.961 --> 01:19:30.202]  They're coming for me.
[01:19:30.202 --> 01:19:31.442]  They're coming for the children.
[01:19:31.442 --> 01:19:34.003]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:37.384]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:38.685]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[01:19:38.925 --> 01:19:41.026]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:46.470]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two primesters after these poison shots.
[01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:50.372]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[01:19:50.372 --> 01:19:51.593]  Let's do it together.
[01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:53.895]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:53.895 --> 01:19:57.697]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:57.697 --> 01:20:00.639]  Now take action now!
[01:20:00.639 --> 01:20:06.543]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.682 --> 01:20:14.567]  I'm sick and tired of getting in my way.
[01:20:14.567 --> 01:20:15.128]  I'm sick and tired.
[01:20:40.076 --> 01:20:57.309]  The American people are sick and tired of any wave at our way.
[01:20:57.309 --> 01:20:59.690]  We want the American way back.
[01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:01.812]  Anybody wants to adopt it, we're going to support them.
[01:21:01.812 --> 01:21:03.193]  1776 worldwide!
[01:21:08.775 --> 01:21:11.759]  These globalists are riding for free.
[01:21:11.759 --> 01:21:13.281]  Trying to run our lives.
[01:21:13.281 --> 01:21:14.642]  Trying to hurt our poor people.
[01:21:14.642 --> 01:21:16.564]  Trying to bankrupt our hard workers.
[01:21:16.564 --> 01:21:18.607]  Trying to inject our troops with deadly poison.
[01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:25.375]  Trying to start World War III.
[01:21:25.375 --> 01:21:26.677]  Nobody rides for free.
[01:21:28.635 --> 01:21:29.996]  We got skimmed the game.
[01:21:29.996 --> 01:21:30.996]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:21:30.996 --> 01:21:31.957]  I'm going to shut up now.
[01:21:31.957 --> 01:21:34.398]  Everybody knows World War III is already on.
[01:21:34.398 --> 01:21:35.398]  What do we do about it?
[01:21:35.398 --> 01:21:37.699]  Laura is in Chicago, an Army veteran.
[01:21:37.699 --> 01:21:38.820]  She has a history degree.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.741]  She wants to talk about World War III.
[01:21:40.741 --> 01:21:43.922]  Germans repeating World War II, now invading Russian areas.
[01:21:43.922 --> 01:21:46.443]  That is what Ukraine is, especially the eastern area.
[01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:46.923]  Go ahead.
[01:21:46.923 --> 01:21:48.784]  Thanks for calling, Laura.
[01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:49.625]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:50.825]  I'm so upset about this.
[01:21:50.825 --> 01:21:57.008]  You know, I was in the Army from 88 to 95, and I was stationed in East Germany at the time, in Darmstadt.
[01:21:57.478 --> 01:22:00.501]  And we would have alerts in the middle of the night, and we'd load up our trucks.
[01:22:00.501 --> 01:22:10.911]  I was an ammunition specialist, and we'd go to, like, the Fulda Gap, and we'd wait for the Russians in the middle of the night to come across the border on all these alerts we'd have.
[01:22:10.911 --> 01:22:16.396]  And, you know, in our training manuals, you know, we're supposed to dig a hole and put our backs against the dirt wall and not look at the blast.
[01:22:17.011 --> 01:22:24.137]  But I don't think people understand what this means, because as a history degree, Germany's always been afraid of a two-front war.
[01:22:24.137 --> 01:22:26.399]  First, you know, Russia, and then the other side was France.
[01:22:26.399 --> 01:22:27.580]  And I've been to those places.
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:28.541]  I've been to the Marne.
[01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:33.205]  I've been to Verdun and Dachau, all these places in Germany.
[01:22:33.205 --> 01:22:39.891]  And I'm terrified because we only get, you know, like, as you said, we're completely surrounded by these Russian subs.
[01:22:40.643 --> 01:22:45.526]  And we only have four minutes, and my kids are in school, and I don't think anyone knows what they're missing.
[01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:47.347]  They're like, oh, the limited nuclear war.
[01:22:47.347 --> 01:22:52.610]  There's no such thing as a limited nuclear thermal war.
[01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:55.892]  And you were in this for many years, so you know how real it is.
[01:22:55.892 --> 01:23:07.779]  All the experts agree, the Doomsday Clock International Organization of scientists agree that we're 90 seconds from nuclear war on the clock, the closest it's ever been to Armageddon.
[01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:08.380]  What do you make of that?
[01:23:09.495 --> 01:23:25.782]  I believe that's true, and the funny thing is, if you read eschatology, like the Bible, like the End Times, all major religions seem to have the same eschatology, like what happens in the End Times, but America's not even mentioned in Revelation.
[01:23:25.782 --> 01:23:34.225]  It's not even mentioned in Ezekiel 38 and 39, and I'm wondering if that's because either we're evil, or we're just too inept to
[01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:43.092]  Well, some say it's not, but you've got the passage about Babylon falling in a single hour.
[01:23:43.092 --> 01:23:45.153]  We're definitely being set up for a fall.
[01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.654]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:53.318]  For me, the biggest historical point, and it's for the Russians, is German tanks invading Russian areas and fighting Russians.
[01:23:53.318 --> 01:23:55.259]  This hasn't happened since the end of 1945.
[01:23:55.259 --> 01:23:58.481]  This is a big deal.
[01:23:58.481 --> 01:24:02.203]  Up next, let's go to Johnny in Canada, a veteran.
[01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:03.224]  Your view on World War III.
[01:24:04.813 --> 01:24:05.814]  Well, nothing good.
[01:24:05.814 --> 01:24:07.615]  You got me loud and clear there, bud, or what?
[01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:08.036]  I do, sir.
[01:24:08.036 --> 01:24:09.097]  Go ahead.
[01:24:09.097 --> 01:24:10.298]  Okay.
[01:24:10.298 --> 01:24:11.939]  Well, it's not good.
[01:24:11.939 --> 01:24:13.080]  It's like you said.
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.081]  We got German tanks.
[01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:16.103]  You know, that's never went wrong before.
[01:24:16.103 --> 01:24:19.285]  Just Google the cauldron.
[01:24:19.285 --> 01:24:24.450]  Yeah, there's even one of the Russian ships that's off the coast of Bermuda, one of the newest frigates.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:25.800]  So I've been told.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.061]  I've got to verify that.
[01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:27.982]  Yeah, it is very bad.
[01:24:27.982 --> 01:24:28.963]  And I just don't understand how
[01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:46.451]  Our leaders can have this humor so they think they can win this.
[01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:51.035]  It's like they're trying to creep us into a mission creep like they did with Iraq.
[01:24:51.035 --> 01:24:56.079]  It's that ladder of tension and escalation, exactly.
[01:24:56.079 --> 01:25:02.064]  And the Pentagon's like, well, we'll take out most of their ships and subs, so only 20% of their missiles will hit us.
[01:25:02.064 --> 01:25:04.486]  20% is enough to destroy the entire United States.
[01:25:04.486 --> 01:25:08.209]  So we go back to Dr. Strangelove, which was a movie based on real stuff.
[01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:12.233]  Curtis LeMay and Ella Lemitzer, the Joint Chiefs of Staff members and the chairman, Lemnitzer,
[01:25:12.873 --> 01:25:13.333]  We're good to go.
[01:25:32.489 --> 01:25:36.833]  And they believe the crisis that this will bring in will be the cover for their New World Order.
[01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:38.394]  They want nuclear war.
[01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:43.519]  And the average idiot going along with this, driving around with their Ukrainian flag, they're just idiots.
[01:25:43.519 --> 01:25:45.361]  They're idiots!
[01:25:45.361 --> 01:25:47.042]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:49.965]  Like, none of this has ever been tested in wartime settings either.
[01:25:49.965 --> 01:25:52.948]  So a lot of it's conjecture in my term.
[01:25:52.948 --> 01:25:57.732]  Because I used to be an EW, I used to be an Inc guy, and there's a whole bunch of other stuff going on up here.
[01:25:58.331 --> 01:26:00.771]  Like, Trudeau's pretty much sold all our war stocks.
[01:26:00.771 --> 01:26:03.812]  Like, he's not sold them, he's given them away.
[01:26:03.812 --> 01:26:04.392]  Right?
[01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:08.053]  We got corporals friggin' in charge of battalions in some respects.
[01:26:08.053 --> 01:26:14.294]  We got Chinese troops openly, I remember two years ago they said Chinese troops were openly, secretly drilling, and the media said it wasn't true.
[01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:21.395]  It turned out it was a giant secret agreement with over 50,000 Chinese troops at any one time, training in Canada.
[01:26:21.395 --> 01:26:22.856]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.856 --> 01:26:25.236]  One more thing, I gotta shout out Jeremy McKenzie.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.481]  Uh, the guy has been totally debanked now from the way I get it.
[01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:31.102]  And, uh, yeah.
[01:26:31.102 --> 01:26:32.282]  Well, it's beyond debanking.
[01:26:32.282 --> 01:26:36.444]  He got charged with a bunch of stuff he didn't do for just being part of the trucker convoy.
[01:26:36.444 --> 01:26:36.944]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:36.944 --> 01:26:37.384]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:37.384 --> 01:26:39.285]  There's a whole whack of stuff going on there.
[01:26:39.285 --> 01:26:41.185]  Alright, I appreciate your call, Johnny.
[01:26:41.185 --> 01:26:46.687]  Folks, I cannot telegraph to you how serious this escalation is and how dangerous it is.
[01:26:46.687 --> 01:26:48.688]  Let's go to John in Texas, a veteran.
[01:26:48.688 --> 01:26:50.829]  Go ahead, John.
[01:26:50.829 --> 01:26:51.709]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:53.609]  Welcome.
[01:26:53.609 --> 01:26:54.730]  Alex, what happened?
[01:26:55.563 --> 01:27:03.753]  This is not a giant plot to disarm NATO, to disarm us, to break us up inside with this COVID virus to be shot and everything.
[01:27:05.642 --> 01:27:14.190]  I totally agree.
[01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:24.260]  Everything the globalists are doing is to debilitate the U.S., cut off our energy, deplete our oil reserves, poison our military, purge our military, and then put Russia and China in a winning position.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.784]  I agree that 3D chess next level, that's what the globalists want.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.881]  I mean, Biden and the New World Order gang would run up the white flag faster than you could say surrender.
[01:27:35.881 --> 01:27:37.781]  And there wouldn't be a nuclear war.
[01:27:37.781 --> 01:27:43.622]  They'd have the world government, but just that they'd be an ally with China and Russia to control everything.
[01:27:43.622 --> 01:27:45.343]  And now you're thinking next level.
[01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.783]  Definitely, I think they want the U.S.
[01:27:46.783 --> 01:27:50.044]  and Russia to destroy ourselves, and then China comes out on top.
[01:27:50.044 --> 01:27:54.304]  That's really, that's really the Henry Kissinger plan.
[01:27:54.304 --> 01:27:57.525]  But the only one that's getting hurt right now is often NATO, because
[01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:04.316]  Russia's making record money off oil, all Russia's losing troops.
[01:28:04.316 --> 01:28:05.757]  You said it, exactly.
[01:28:05.757 --> 01:28:12.083]  And again, the war game think tanks know all this, brother, so yes, you're right.
[01:28:12.083 --> 01:28:20.069]  I mean, they're sending all that stuff there, and Zelensky's not selling it off, they're destroying it before it even gets it to the troops.
[01:28:20.069 --> 01:28:21.090]  Well, exactly.
[01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:24.773]  And where are we giving our Strategic Oil Reserve to Americans?
[01:28:24.773 --> 01:28:25.394]  No, China.
[01:28:28.482 --> 01:28:34.223]  So you need to be worried, but we need to be worried about the New World Order coming because... Oh, I agree.
[01:28:34.223 --> 01:28:35.163]  I agree.
[01:28:35.163 --> 01:28:38.024]  This is much more sophisticated than what you're saying.
[01:28:38.024 --> 01:28:38.664]  Great call.
[01:28:38.664 --> 01:28:39.484]  Thank you so much, John.
[01:28:39.484 --> 01:28:40.164]  Good to hear from you.
[01:28:40.164 --> 01:28:41.144]  John's been calling for 20 years.
[01:28:41.144 --> 01:28:41.844]  I recognize his voice.
[01:28:41.844 --> 01:28:43.005]  Love you, John.
[01:28:43.005 --> 01:28:43.805]  Hadn't heard from you in years.
[01:28:43.805 --> 01:28:44.945]  Good to hear your voice, brother.
[01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:46.465]  Love you.
[01:28:46.465 --> 01:28:51.986]  Electric Eye, Terry, Marvin, Hopper, Tim, everybody.
[01:28:51.986 --> 01:28:54.907]  And speaking of Electric Eye, let's come in with Electric Eye.
[01:28:54.907 --> 01:28:55.627]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:59.592 --> 01:29:02.273]  I just want to say about diet force.
[01:29:02.273 --> 01:29:04.114]  Diet force is amazing!
[01:29:04.114 --> 01:29:09.696]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:29:09.696 --> 01:29:12.297]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[01:29:12.297 --> 01:29:18.640]  Like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.861]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.305]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[01:29:24.305 --> 01:29:27.027]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[01:29:27.027 --> 01:29:29.930]  You have to get the DietForce and have to a day.
[01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:31.711]  And just keep acting.
[01:29:31.711 --> 01:29:33.193]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:33.193 --> 01:29:34.093]  X7 DietForce.
[01:29:34.093 --> 01:29:37.576]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby!
[01:29:37.576 --> 01:29:38.217]  Now on sale.
[01:29:38.217 --> 01:29:39.118]  DietForce.
[01:29:39.118 --> 01:29:39.838]  We're cutting that ad.
[01:29:39.838 --> 01:29:41.100]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:41.900]  I can guarantee you that.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:43.922]  Thanks so much for the call, Grant.
[01:29:43.922 --> 01:29:45.463]  God bless Australia.
[01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:46.584]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:29:46.584 --> 01:29:47.205]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:29:47.205 --> 01:29:48.266]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:48.266 --> 01:29:48.906]  DietForce.
[01:29:48.906 --> 01:29:49.347]  Get it now.
[01:30:00.293 --> 01:30:03.454]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:30:03.454 --> 01:30:05.755]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:30:05.755 --> 01:30:09.676]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:30:09.676 --> 01:30:18.619]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:30:18.619 --> 01:30:26.401]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:31.053]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:30:31.053 --> 01:30:36.855]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:30:36.855 --> 01:30:39.896]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:30:39.896 --> 01:30:48.118]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:30:48.858 --> 01:30:53.124]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[01:30:53.124 --> 01:30:58.090]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:30:58.090 --> 01:30:59.071]  Please take action now.
[01:30:59.071 --> 01:31:05.039]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect.
[01:31:05.319 --> 01:31:08.260]  Throughout time and space, we're actually winning the info war.
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:18.425]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts, whose information is beyond incredible.
[01:31:18.425 --> 01:31:24.127]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[01:31:24.127 --> 01:31:26.708]  Millions of people a day, visiting Bandot Video.
[01:31:26.708 --> 01:31:29.970]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect.
[01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:31.130]  We're good to go.
[01:32:01.476 --> 01:32:05.777]  Silver Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:32:05.777 --> 01:32:14.080]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.621]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:26.144]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:32:26.984 --> 01:32:34.871]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:45.319]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:32:45.319 --> 01:32:48.062]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:48.202]  Only.
[01:32:48.802 --> 01:32:52.944]  And then you get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:32:52.944 --> 01:33:00.688]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:33:00.688 --> 01:33:05.310]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:06.571]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.546 --> 01:33:25.430]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:31.675]  I'm up here in space.
[01:33:31.675 --> 01:33:38.740]  I'm looking down on you.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:41.122]  Everything you do.
[01:33:41.122 --> 01:33:46.006]  You think you've got private lives, think nothing of the kind.
[01:33:46.006 --> 01:33:49.609]  There is no true escape, I'm watching all the time.
[01:33:53.291 --> 01:33:56.058]  My sight is clean!
[01:33:56.058 --> 01:33:57.762]  I am perpetual!
[01:33:57.762 --> 01:33:59.426]  I keep the country free!
[01:34:05.054 --> 01:34:07.315]  Dear TV viewer, we're going to roll that tape again.
[01:34:07.315 --> 01:34:25.266]  That's an Abrams N1A1 frontline battle tank, launched in the age of Ronald Reagan, still the top battle tank in the world, firing a DU sabot round that will shoot straight through any tank on earth.
[01:34:25.266 --> 01:34:27.267]  And it is uranium.
[01:34:27.267 --> 01:34:31.890]  Pound after pound after pound after pound of uranium-tipped explosive.
[01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:36.753]  And it is a crime against humanity to use those weapons.
[01:34:36.753 --> 01:34:41.957]  They were developed to stop the five-to-one Russian superiority during the Cold War.
[01:34:41.957 --> 01:34:42.858]  They invaded Germany.
[01:34:44.525 --> 01:34:45.866]  Or West Germany.
[01:34:45.866 --> 01:34:52.450]  And now they finally get their Cold War battle plans out and roll the Abrams in with the DU weapons.
[01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:56.473]  And they've got all the different armored vehicles firing the DU weapons as well.
[01:34:56.473 --> 01:35:05.039]  They're not the big SABOs, but a DU 50 cal round shot within a few thousand yards will penetrate most armor.
[01:35:05.039 --> 01:35:08.721]  Shot closer, it'll go through anything.
[01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:13.485]  And so, Russia is now responding to this
[01:35:15.057 --> 01:35:29.367]  Saying, any use of DU will be considered the use of a radiological weapon, and will be seen as a nuclear attack, and nuclear weapons will be used, the Russian government is now reporting.
[01:35:29.367 --> 01:35:42.897]  Moscow will consider deliveries of Western-made munitions, which contain uranium, to Kiev as equivalent to the use of dirty nuclear bombs, says head of the Russian delegation of the negotiations of the Ministry of Security and Arms Control in Vienna.
[01:35:42.897 --> 01:35:43.938]  We looked it up, it's true.
[01:35:45.563 --> 01:35:46.904]  World War II, 2.0.
[01:35:46.904 --> 01:35:51.926]  Germany declares war on Russia as US pledges to send heavy battle tanks.
[01:35:51.926 --> 01:35:53.006]  Again, we've got to reprint that.
[01:35:53.006 --> 01:35:53.767]  That's a typo.
[01:35:53.767 --> 01:35:57.268]  It's heavy battle tanks.
[01:35:57.268 --> 01:36:02.070]  So, there we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:03.371]  Amazing calls last segment.
[01:36:03.371 --> 01:36:04.591]  Let's go back to more.
[01:36:04.591 --> 01:36:06.412]  Electric Eye from Connecticut.
[01:36:06.412 --> 01:36:10.454]  Veteran, retired police officer, what's your take on this?
[01:36:10.454 --> 01:36:11.935]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:36:11.935 --> 01:36:12.675]  My take is this.
[01:36:13.869 --> 01:36:16.590]  We couldn't be in a more serious situation right now.
[01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:26.652]  The entire world is facing annihilation by the shipment of these tanks and all the other foolishness the Biden administration is doing with Zelensky over there.
[01:36:26.652 --> 01:36:35.855]  So, we're at the point, I want peaceful solutions to this, but if these tanks get shipped, that could be the tipping point.
[01:36:35.855 --> 01:36:39.016]  So that shipment of tanks needs to be stopped.
[01:36:39.016 --> 01:36:40.516]  Biden needs to be stopped.
[01:36:42.437 --> 01:36:43.157]  I mean, I agree.
[01:36:43.157 --> 01:36:49.963]  Millions of peaceful Americans, left, right, center, old, young, Christian, gay, straight, should be out protesting this damn war.
[01:36:49.963 --> 01:36:51.725]  Where's the old liberals that were against war?
[01:36:51.725 --> 01:36:55.228]  I mean, even wars that were nothing compared to this, they were against them.
[01:36:55.228 --> 01:36:57.129]  Now they love it!
[01:36:57.129 --> 01:37:05.536]  Yeah, you know, I've been talking to a bunch of them lately, and they're aware now that there's a massive problem, but they're still who they are.
[01:37:05.536 --> 01:37:06.858]  They haven't researched the history.
[01:37:07.711 --> 01:37:08.952]  Well, that's the biggest problem.
[01:37:08.952 --> 01:37:10.313]  In fact, I never got to this days ago.
[01:37:10.313 --> 01:37:12.815]  It's got tens of millions of views on Twitter.
[01:37:12.815 --> 01:37:13.676]  And I'm going to cover this now.
[01:37:13.676 --> 01:37:14.456]  I'm going to let you finish.
[01:37:14.456 --> 01:37:20.141]  But guys, pull up the Vice Magazine and HBO video.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:21.920]  of course.
[01:37:40.828 --> 01:37:41.948]  No, it's the whole casing.
[01:37:41.948 --> 01:37:46.129]  Rifles don't fire the whole casing, and the powder, and the cap with the bullet.
[01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:54.711]  And they don't even know that, and Vice is so disconnected, they did fake photo shoots with a full bullet, stuck through metal.
[01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:58.032]  In fact, I'll pull it up right here, overhead shot.
[01:37:58.032 --> 01:37:59.912]  I'm gonna go back to you sir, I'm not cutting you short.
[01:37:59.912 --> 01:38:00.852]  Look at this.
[01:38:00.852 --> 01:38:04.373]  So here's Vice, inside El Chapo's son's house after a deadly gunfight.
[01:38:05.595 --> 01:38:09.357]  Then they put this photo and video out saying, look, the bullet stuck out of the wall.
[01:38:09.357 --> 01:38:09.857]  No, it didn't.
[01:38:09.857 --> 01:38:10.838]  It's a full casing.
[01:38:10.838 --> 01:38:12.078]  And maybe that's a 5.56.
[01:38:12.078 --> 01:38:14.520]  This is 5.56.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.061]  The point is, is that it's sticking through the hole.
[01:38:17.061 --> 01:38:18.362]  It's an entire casing.
[01:38:18.362 --> 01:38:27.626]  It's an entire, not the round for liberals who've never been out of their apartment building and never driven a tractor, never hunted deer, never been in a fistfight.
[01:38:27.626 --> 01:38:29.928]  You guys are like space aliens or something.
[01:38:29.928 --> 01:38:31.328]  Let me explain something to you.
[01:38:31.328 --> 01:38:33.169]  That's a full casing.
[01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:34.670]  That's a full bullet.
[01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:35.270]  I think?
[01:38:56.491 --> 01:38:59.713]  These people have not done anything, and they're cheerleading.
[01:38:59.713 --> 01:39:00.994]  Sean Penn, I got the clip.
[01:39:00.994 --> 01:39:02.055]  Guys, pull it up.
[01:39:02.055 --> 01:39:09.260]  Sean Penn a month ago said nuclear war is survivable, and we shouldn't take striking Russia first with nuclear weapons.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.722]  Hey, Sean, do you know what that means?
[01:39:11.722 --> 01:39:15.705]  The end of the goddamn world, you stupid fucking asshole!
[01:39:15.705 --> 01:39:16.286]  Excuse me.
[01:39:16.286 --> 01:39:21.029]  I'm just, I'm, I am so sick of these warmongering pedophiles!
[01:39:21.029 --> 01:39:21.530]  I'm sorry.
[01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:22.891]  Electric Eye, I'm going to shut up.
[01:39:22.891 --> 01:39:23.711]  I'm going to cool down.
[01:39:23.711 --> 01:39:24.712]  You just go ahead and make your statement.
[01:39:25.616 --> 01:39:28.478]  Yeah, I couldn't have said it better right there.
[01:39:28.478 --> 01:39:30.320]  The liberals, they're not in the Bible.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.661]  They have eyes that cannot see.
[01:39:32.661 --> 01:39:34.102]  And we're in the Bible.
[01:39:34.102 --> 01:39:39.967]  And this is where the situation goes to all you idiots in the world who are on the side of this.
[01:39:39.967 --> 01:39:43.890]  Your ass is going to be dust too if this isn't stopped, right?
[01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:48.353]  So many of us see we need a Nuremberg 2 like last week, right?
[01:39:49.119 --> 01:39:50.280]  And I want peace here.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.542]  I want this to end peacefully.
[01:39:51.542 --> 01:39:57.468]  But as a poor retired cop, too, when you're faced with deadly force, I'm going home at night.
[01:39:57.468 --> 01:39:57.869]  All right.
[01:39:57.869 --> 01:40:00.912]  And I want to wake up in the morning, too.
[01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:02.414]  So I don't know how to solve this.
[01:40:02.414 --> 01:40:08.060]  But when Hitler's generals and I'm not calling for any Biden violence, don't ask Biden, but
[01:40:08.789 --> 01:40:10.950]  They had Nuremberg, too, and they had Valkyrie.
[01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:15.431]  Remember, they had what Tom Cruise was in there?
[01:40:15.431 --> 01:40:17.331]  Ernest Ronald actually led that.
[01:40:17.331 --> 01:40:21.533]  The Germans, a year and a half before, tried to stop Hitler.
[01:40:21.533 --> 01:40:23.033]  Right, and that's what needs to happen.
[01:40:23.033 --> 01:40:31.475]  No, I'm not saying do violence, but if you don't stop Biden, and the whole effing White House, and if you don't stop these woke generals, we're all gone!
[01:40:31.475 --> 01:40:33.696]  Well, here's the problem, here's the problem, Electric Eye.
[01:40:34.704 --> 01:40:35.124]  The U.S.
[01:40:35.124 --> 01:40:37.146]  has thousands of Abrams in Germany.
[01:40:37.146 --> 01:40:38.847]  We just showed video for TV viewers.
[01:40:38.847 --> 01:40:40.688]  They're already shipping the Abrams.
[01:40:40.688 --> 01:40:44.450]  And of course, it's always 31st and 100 next and 1,000 next.
[01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:48.213]  They're already shipping the tanks in right now.
[01:40:48.213 --> 01:40:50.314]  Yeah, man.
[01:40:50.314 --> 01:40:51.895]  Is Davos still happening right now?
[01:40:51.895 --> 01:40:52.936]  It's over.
[01:40:52.936 --> 01:40:53.276]  It's over.
[01:40:53.276 --> 01:40:53.676]  All right.
[01:40:53.676 --> 01:40:54.337]  So there goes that.
[01:40:56.291 --> 01:41:08.702]  You're not calling for violence, either am I. But these globalists, and most of them have never been in the military, never been in a fight, they don't think about consequences because they've gotten away with so much, but they can't get away with a nuclear war!
[01:41:08.702 --> 01:41:13.366]  They have to understand that they have no fear is their problem.
[01:41:13.366 --> 01:41:15.548]  No fear, no sense, and they don't care.
[01:41:15.548 --> 01:41:17.990]  They still go to work or whatever they do during the day.
[01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:21.794]  They go home and they go nip blankets or whatever stuff they do.
[01:41:22.458 --> 01:41:24.039]  They're not in the books like we are.
[01:41:24.039 --> 01:41:27.961]  They don't know history, and it's repeating, and we're at the end of it.
[01:41:27.961 --> 01:41:29.061]  So... I agree.
[01:41:29.061 --> 01:41:36.125]  I have a real sense of almost resignation at this point, because, I mean, this is... I cannot believe how bad it is, Electric Eye.
[01:41:36.125 --> 01:41:37.365]  I mean, I'm a smart guy.
[01:41:37.365 --> 01:41:37.906]  You're a smart guy.
[01:41:37.906 --> 01:41:42.488]  I mean, I look at this, and it's surreal that our, quote, rulers would do something this dangerous.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.581]  They're all in the Bible.
[01:41:44.581 --> 01:41:46.663]  All of these people are in the Bible.
[01:41:46.663 --> 01:41:47.744]  Every single character is in there.
[01:41:47.744 --> 01:41:48.105]  You said it.
[01:41:48.105 --> 01:41:48.705]  Repeat that.
[01:41:48.705 --> 01:41:49.806]  In fact, guys, pull it up.
[01:41:49.806 --> 01:41:54.390]  Where is it in the Bible where they say that they'll be given great delusion and have eyes but can't see?
[01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:55.631]  Because you're right.
[01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:57.253]  I've seen that, I think, a couple times.
[01:41:57.253 --> 01:41:57.994]  You know what's crazy?
[01:41:57.994 --> 01:41:58.934]  I called you a year ago.
[01:41:58.934 --> 01:42:01.297]  I was in the Lamentations of Jeremiah.
[01:42:01.297 --> 01:42:03.679]  And this year, four more pages, I'll be right back.
[01:42:03.679 --> 01:42:04.780]  I kept reading it twice.
[01:42:05.623 --> 01:42:09.204]  And I think, I mean, people want answers or at least see what you're facing.
[01:42:09.204 --> 01:42:10.864]  You better get your face in that book.
[01:42:10.864 --> 01:42:14.085]  It's called The Living Word of God because you're effing living it right now.
[01:42:14.085 --> 01:42:16.406]  And you're in the end of it.
[01:42:16.406 --> 01:42:22.147]  And you know, and anybody that's in with this, again, your house is going to be gone, your life will be gone.
[01:42:22.147 --> 01:42:31.490]  And either Christ comes down here before that happens and divides us and throws them back in hell where they're from and brings us up, or nuclear war happens and then we get divided.
[01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:33.210]  There's your two freaking choices right there.
[01:42:34.045 --> 01:42:34.465]  Alright?
[01:42:34.465 --> 01:42:37.308]  And I don't... I'd rather have the one without the nukes.
[01:42:59.898 --> 01:43:06.817]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:43:07.574 --> 01:43:09.614]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:43:09.614 --> 01:43:11.335]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:43:11.335 --> 01:43:12.895]  They know we've got their number.
[01:43:12.895 --> 01:43:17.616]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:43:17.616 --> 01:43:25.498]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:43:25.498 --> 01:43:35.880]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[01:43:36.892 --> 01:43:37.192]  Thank you.
[01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:02.769]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:05.531]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[01:44:05.531 --> 01:44:08.193]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:44:08.193 --> 01:44:09.554]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:44:09.554 --> 01:44:13.457]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:44:13.457 --> 01:44:18.361]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:44:18.641 --> 01:44:24.824]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[01:44:24.824 --> 01:44:33.449]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:44:33.449 --> 01:44:38.992]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:44:38.992 --> 01:44:44.555]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[01:44:44.795 --> 01:44:47.278]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:44:47.278 --> 01:44:49.961]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:44:49.961 --> 01:44:51.463]  So go check out the store.
[01:44:51.463 --> 01:44:52.644]  Go support their store.
[01:44:52.644 --> 01:44:54.146]  Go support InfoWars.
[01:44:54.146 --> 01:44:55.527]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:44:55.527 --> 01:44:57.069]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[01:44:57.069 --> 01:45:05.439]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[01:45:06.727 --> 01:45:17.117]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:45:17.117 --> 01:45:29.868]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:45:30.529 --> 01:45:31.310]  We're good to go.
[01:45:59.468 --> 01:46:07.052]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:46:07.052 --> 01:46:08.673]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[01:46:08.673 --> 01:46:18.839]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:24.162]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[01:46:24.542 --> 01:46:36.715]  Millions of people a day visiting Bandai Video, but you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[01:46:36.715 --> 01:46:39.258]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[01:46:39.258 --> 01:46:42.121]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:46:42.401 --> 01:46:47.646]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:46:47.646 --> 01:47:00.719]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:47:00.719 --> 01:47:06.605]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.101 --> 01:47:26.327]  Almost heaven, West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
[01:47:30.023 --> 01:47:49.321]  Life is older, older than the trees Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze Country roads, take me home To the place, to the place I belong
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.141]  Our families, our country, our world is hanging in the balance of these psychotics.
[01:47:58.141 --> 01:48:04.202]  You wonder why people start World War I or World War II or all this stuff, because these people love it and they're evil.
[01:48:04.202 --> 01:48:08.783]  And they've already got us in a war with Russia, and it's escalating into nuclear war, and Russia's on record.
[01:48:08.783 --> 01:48:17.045]  And I don't like to mention something and not play it, even though it's on record, I'm unlike mainstream media, where they go, Alex Jones is a white supremacist, they don't ever show you a clip.
[01:48:17.045 --> 01:48:18.305]  Or Alex Jones sent people to
[01:48:19.335 --> 01:48:21.016]  Parents of dead kids to piss on their graves.
[01:48:21.016 --> 01:48:21.697]  Where's the proof?
[01:48:21.697 --> 01:48:23.078]  It's not there.
[01:48:23.078 --> 01:48:24.059]  And they just do that.
[01:48:24.059 --> 01:48:25.820]  When we make a claim, we show it to you.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:32.225]  Here's Sean Penn, months ago, saying we shouldn't be afraid to use nukes first on Russia.
[01:48:32.225 --> 01:48:36.348]  I mean, that's just calling for war crimes, calling for psychotic end of the world.
[01:48:36.348 --> 01:48:41.492]  That's what the villains in Dr. Strangelove called for, based on what L.L.
[01:48:41.492 --> 01:48:47.257]  Lemonsir and Curtis LeMay of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called for with Kennedy in 61, and he said no, and they killed his ass.
[01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:49.552]  These people are crazy.
[01:48:49.552 --> 01:48:50.793]  They've got underground bases.
[01:48:50.793 --> 01:48:51.974]  They think they're safe.
[01:48:51.974 --> 01:48:55.376]  They think they can win this war because there'll be no civilization left.
[01:48:55.376 --> 01:48:58.838]  They'll be in charge of everything when they do this.
[01:48:58.838 --> 01:49:00.139]  That's why they want it.
[01:49:00.139 --> 01:49:06.204]  Mr. President, we must not allow a mineshaft gap, says Dr. Strangelove.
[01:49:06.204 --> 01:49:11.908]  In fact, guys, we're going to play this clip of Sean Penn.
[01:49:11.908 --> 01:49:17.392]  I remember one time I had dinner with Sean Penn, and I've told this story a couple times for three hours.
[01:49:18.502 --> 01:49:23.705]  And he was so stupid, beyond retarded, beyond autistic.
[01:49:23.705 --> 01:49:26.327]  I don't mean being mean to autistic people.
[01:49:26.327 --> 01:49:30.450]  He literally is a moron that reads off scripts.
[01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:32.851]  And so who's giving him the script to call for nuclear war?
[01:49:32.851 --> 01:49:40.016]  We got a bunch of Democrat, Republican senators calling for first strikes on Russia.
[01:49:40.016 --> 01:49:43.438]  I played those clips too.
[01:49:43.438 --> 01:49:44.859]  And Hollywood scum.
[01:49:46.144 --> 01:49:48.885]  Like Sean Penn.
[01:49:48.885 --> 01:49:54.467]  You know, in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, they go, he's a great actor, he comes off as a dumb stoner.
[01:49:54.467 --> 01:49:56.407]  He's dumb.
[01:49:56.407 --> 01:49:58.808]  He's a moron.
[01:49:58.808 --> 01:50:03.630]  He's literally a NPC.
[01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:06.131]  He's not a real person.
[01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:09.212]  He's a hologram, spiritually.
[01:50:09.212 --> 01:50:09.572]  Here he is.
[01:50:11.181 --> 01:50:17.630]  We saw and talked to whether they were in uniform, out of uniform, school teachers, even children.
[01:50:18.504 --> 01:50:28.590]  This extraordinary courage that's come up, and it was in his eyes, and it is clear to me that the Ukrainians will win this.
[01:50:28.590 --> 01:50:30.551]  The question is, at what cost?
[01:50:30.551 --> 01:50:44.840]  Did they have, in those early hours, I know that Trump gave them javelins, I know that they had some defenses, but if you go back to the Budapest Agreement, they were, at the time, the third largest nuclear power in the world.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:48.042]  And they made an agreement that they'd give those weapons to the
[01:50:48.746 --> 01:50:56.467]  To Russia, to be destroyed in exchange for protection from Russia, Great Britain and the US.
[01:50:56.467 --> 01:51:02.069]  Lesson to be learned here, don't give up your nuclear weapons if you have them, because you can't believe people like Vladimir Putin.
[01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:06.809]  Well, even countries that have nuclear weapons can remain intimidated to use them.
[01:51:06.809 --> 01:51:09.490]  And we're seeing that now with our own country.
[01:51:09.490 --> 01:51:11.810]  And I fear what that legacy is going to be.
[01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:13.911]  We don't want, no one wants to see a nuclear conflict.
[01:51:13.911 --> 01:51:14.631]  I don't want to see one.
[01:51:15.591 --> 01:51:22.933]  At the same time, if only one bully is going to be able to use those weapons as a threat, we've got to rethink what we're doing.
[01:51:22.933 --> 01:51:25.454]  See, I think the West made a mistake.
[01:51:25.454 --> 01:51:37.857]  But the Russians aren't using their nuclear weapons, and now the U.S., run by the globalists, when it's not poisoning our troops with shots, or critical race theory, or draggling story time, or pedophile time, is doing that.
[01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.338]  Guys, go to YouTube.
[01:51:39.338 --> 01:51:39.738]  It'll be there.
[01:51:41.499 --> 01:51:44.261]  Dr. Strangelove Mine Shaft Gap.
[01:51:44.261 --> 01:51:45.662]  Because the U.S.
[01:51:45.662 --> 01:51:49.784]  bombers have been sent by Jack T. Ripper, which is Curtis LeMay.
[01:51:49.784 --> 01:51:52.746]  They've successfully dropped a nuke on the Russians.
[01:51:52.746 --> 01:52:00.251]  The Russians have launched their Baltonium-G dirty bomb nukes that'll radiate the Earth for half a billion years.
[01:52:00.251 --> 01:52:01.471]  And they go, it's okay.
[01:52:01.471 --> 01:52:03.052]  We'll all live in mine shafts now.
[01:52:03.052 --> 01:52:04.533]  We already have them built.
[01:52:04.533 --> 01:52:10.377]  And then they jump and say, Mr. President, we cannot allow, George C. Scott does, a mine shaft gap.
[01:52:11.749 --> 01:52:12.550]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:19.074]  I feel your pain when it comes to breaking up your segments on what you want to talk about because really everything just ties together.
[01:52:37.722 --> 01:52:47.609]  Right now, what we've kind of got ourselves into is a use-it-or-lose-it situation because they've poisoned all the troops and all of the rest of society with the vaccine.
[01:52:47.609 --> 01:52:49.710]  So, you know, what are they going to do?
[01:52:49.710 --> 01:52:53.092]  Are they just going to wait until everybody dies?
[01:52:53.092 --> 01:52:53.633]  Exactly.
[01:52:53.633 --> 01:52:58.996]  I said for three years, after the poison shots, what's the next big event to cover up what they did?
[01:52:58.996 --> 01:53:00.057]  Exactly.
[01:53:00.057 --> 01:53:02.158]  So now they need a new diversion for what they did.
[01:53:02.158 --> 01:53:03.179]  You are on target.
[01:53:04.318 --> 01:53:12.066]  Yeah, but the problem is, I think they're relying on AI and psych profiles for what they believe Putin will do.
[01:53:12.066 --> 01:53:18.873]  And a good movie, while you're looking at movies, to kind of put this in perspective, might be the end of the Bedford incident.
[01:53:19.418 --> 01:53:20.479]  I haven't seen that.
[01:53:20.479 --> 01:53:22.141]  I haven't read about that movie.
[01:53:22.141 --> 01:53:22.901]  What's the name again?
[01:53:22.901 --> 01:53:23.522]  The Bedford Incident.
[01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:42.836]  So that's kind of what they're relying on.
[01:53:42.836 --> 01:53:46.041]  They're pressuring so much in this psychological operation.
[01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:46.621]  Exactly!
[01:53:46.621 --> 01:53:49.626]  You are, oh my god, they're just hoping somebody jumps.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:55.742]  Yeah, the German tank psychological operation aspect of this just kind of gives it all away.
[01:53:55.742 --> 01:53:59.143]  I mean, it's purely psychological operation.
[01:53:59.143 --> 01:53:59.863]  Explain that.
[01:53:59.863 --> 01:54:05.105]  Send the Germans in that killed 22 million Russians and 20 million Germans killed mainly by the Russians.
[01:54:05.105 --> 01:54:07.346]  I'm not saying my grandfathers weren't in World War II.
[01:54:07.346 --> 01:54:10.007]  I'm not saying we didn't lose, you know, all together.
[01:54:10.007 --> 01:54:13.308]  But 90% of World War II was the Germans and the Russians.
[01:54:13.308 --> 01:54:14.049]  Exactly.
[01:54:14.049 --> 01:54:19.871]  To do that when so many of their grandparents died, that is... Talk about what that's meant to do to the Russians.
[01:54:20.802 --> 01:54:47.315]  Yeah, I mean, it's automatic manipulation that, you know, it's going to set them off, and they're right now, you can bet, begging Putin to nuke Berlin or nuke somebody, you know, and they may not want to go full nuclear war, and the AI that's kind of running this and telling Austin and these idiots what to do, you know, when they're punching in all the variables, you know, they're saying, oh, Putin won't go full, you know, full launch, and he may not want to, and if you kind of look at it,
[01:54:47.734 --> 01:54:55.380]  Really, for everything we've kind of been up in arms about, this whole Ukraine war has been defined by really a bunch of nothing.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:00.624]  Like, I mean, if you kind of think about it, like, it's kind of in a permanent... Marvin, I'm not kissing your ass.
[01:55:00.624 --> 01:55:02.406]  I'm going to shut the last two minutes of the hour.
[01:55:02.406 --> 01:55:03.387]  You say you're a veteran.
[01:55:03.387 --> 01:55:06.089]  You said the smartest things I've heard.
[01:55:06.089 --> 01:55:07.210]  What did you do in the military?
[01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:08.571]  Spend a few minutes on what you think is about to happen.
[01:55:09.793 --> 01:55:14.434]  Well, you know, I have a little bit of a background in analytical type work and stuff like that.
[01:55:14.434 --> 01:55:22.856]  And when I got out of the military, oddly enough, with your other story today about the vets having to pay their bonuses back, I had a similar situation, but that's a whole other story.
[01:55:22.856 --> 01:55:27.918]  But, uh, so when I got out, you know, I went on to do other things and other agencies.
[01:55:27.918 --> 01:55:35.280]  But, uh, you know, nobody knows for sure what's going to happen, including the idiots that are there following the programming, so to speak.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.240]  But they believe in it.
[01:55:36.647 --> 01:55:42.710]  And as long as they have faith, you know, they're going to keep following the plan, even if it leads to total destruction.
[01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:48.192]  And by the way, their AI, they admit said Hillary would win, but the damn AI is not that accurate.
[01:55:48.192 --> 01:55:49.313]  They can't just rely on that.
[01:55:49.313 --> 01:55:49.853]  They're idiots.
[01:55:50.885 --> 01:55:51.946]  That's the problem.
[01:55:51.946 --> 01:55:56.130]  Putin, like every other human on Earth, has free will, and we don't know what's going to happen.
[01:55:56.130 --> 01:56:00.674]  And all I can guarantee you is that there's not meant to be a winner.
[01:56:00.674 --> 01:56:04.957]  The United States or Russia is not meant to come out of this a winner.
[01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:14.946]  There will be no more patriotic United States after whatever happens happens, and there will be no more orthodox Christian Russia after whatever happens happens.
[01:56:14.946 --> 01:56:16.608]  That much I can tell you.
[01:56:16.608 --> 01:56:17.869]  Everything else is, you know,
[01:56:18.497 --> 01:56:26.322]  So what are the other people, because I can tell you know what you're talking about, other people you worked in in agencies, how are they feeling about this?
[01:56:26.322 --> 01:56:33.727]  Well I don't work there anymore and thank God and you know if I did I would quit which is kind of what happened you know you get a moment.
[01:56:33.727 --> 01:56:36.389]  What are your former colleagues view?
[01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:37.970]  Do they concur with you?
[01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:43.034]  I mean this is stuff that's been building for years you know so I had a good buddy and me and him I mean we're talking back in 2010-11
[01:56:45.305 --> 01:56:52.469]  You know, we could see the writing on the wall, and we were already talking about learning how to, you know, pick herbs to eat out in the forest.
[01:56:52.469 --> 01:56:59.712]  I was about to say, all the guys I know like you that ran major... I know people that ran, like, were deputy directors of projects, or directors of projects.
[01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:00.813]  They've been like, it's done.
[01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:03.054]  They're just like you.
[01:57:03.054 --> 01:57:03.874]  They're just like done.
[01:57:03.874 --> 01:57:06.055]  They're like... I was nothing.
[01:57:06.055 --> 01:57:07.396]  I've never been that special.
[01:57:07.396 --> 01:57:09.057]  I don't claim to be anybody special.
[01:57:09.057 --> 01:57:13.919]  I just have eyes and ears, and I did get to see a few things here and there, and it was
[01:57:14.358 --> 01:57:14.718]  I don't know.
[01:57:35.305 --> 01:57:41.073]  Well, somebody's got to survive because, you know, Jesus comes back and there's got to be somebody here.
[01:57:41.073 --> 01:57:42.636]  No, I agree with you.
[01:57:42.636 --> 01:57:43.978]  Marvin, incredible call.
[01:57:43.978 --> 01:57:44.859]  More calls coming up.
[01:57:44.859 --> 01:57:45.200]  Stay with us.
[01:57:49.708 --> 01:57:54.293]  Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:57:54.293 --> 01:57:59.479]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[01:57:59.479 --> 01:58:04.344]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:58:04.344 --> 01:58:08.668]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:58:09.269 --> 01:58:18.773]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[01:58:18.773 --> 01:58:24.396]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt manned the arena.
[01:58:24.716 --> 01:58:31.780]  We're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:40.285]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:58:40.285 --> 01:58:44.788]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.
[01:58:44.788 --> 01:58:46.609]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[01:58:49.711 --> 01:58:54.236]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[01:58:54.236 --> 01:59:06.689]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:59:06.689 --> 01:59:07.871]  These are high-end.
[01:59:07.871 --> 01:59:08.952]  These are the very best.
[01:59:09.252 --> 01:59:11.714]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:59:11.714 --> 01:59:12.254]  Well, guess what?
[01:59:12.254 --> 01:59:18.039]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:59:18.039 --> 01:59:20.661]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:59:20.661 --> 01:59:27.546]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[01:59:27.546 --> 01:59:32.750]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:33.731]  The highest quality.
[01:59:34.011 --> 01:59:42.798]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:59:42.798 --> 01:59:52.527]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com.
[01:59:52.527 --> 01:59:56.450]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.698 --> 02:00:15.210]  Alright, I'm going to play a clip from Dr. Strangelove, 1964, which was based on real plans that were there, and then I'm going to go to break in five minutes, and I'm going to bang out all the calls.
[02:00:15.210 --> 02:00:21.536]  Then I've got a special guest that will be with me from the bottom of the hour, 30 minutes to the next hour, and then Kate Daly will do 30 minutes.
[02:00:21.536 --> 02:00:26.961]  She understands doing the fourth hour, sometimes I commandeer it, and I appreciate her and don't disrespect her.
[02:00:28.459 --> 02:00:36.743]  What you see in this 1964 Stanley Kubrick movie, which we have the background of right here, is what is actually happening now.
[02:00:36.743 --> 02:00:38.744]  The old battle plans are happening now.
[02:00:38.744 --> 02:00:44.507]  Here's the report, and we're going to come out of break hot, straight to your calls.
[02:00:44.507 --> 02:00:51.430]  I would think that possibly 100 years.
[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:54.992]  You mean people could actually stay down there for 100 years?
[02:00:54.992 --> 02:00:56.913]  It would not be difficult, mein Führer.
[02:00:57.745 --> 02:01:02.628]  Nuclear reactors could... I'm sorry, Mr. President.
[02:01:02.628 --> 02:01:06.450]  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely.
[02:01:06.450 --> 02:01:09.451]  Greenhouses could maintain plant life.
[02:01:09.451 --> 02:01:11.672]  Animals could be bred and slaughtered.
[02:01:11.672 --> 02:01:17.515]  A quick survey would have to be made of all the available mine sites in the country.
[02:01:17.515 --> 02:01:25.580]  But I would guess that a dwelling space for several hundred thousand of our people could easily be provided.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:25.900]  Well, I'm...
[02:01:26.730 --> 02:01:31.254]  I would hate to have to decide who stays up and who goes down.
[02:01:31.254 --> 02:01:35.358]  Well, that would not be necessary, Mr. President.
[02:01:35.358 --> 02:01:38.261]  Could easily be accomplished with a computer.
[02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:49.011]  And the computer could be set and programmed to accept factors from youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills.
[02:01:49.991 --> 02:02:06.884]  Of course it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included to foster and impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
[02:02:06.884 --> 02:02:09.847]  Actually, they would breed prodigiously, eh?
[02:02:09.847 --> 02:02:12.348]  There would be much time and little to do.
[02:02:14.196 --> 02:02:29.608]  But with the proper breeding techniques and the ratio of, say, 10 females to each male, I would guess that they could then work their way back to the present gross national product within, say, 20 years.
[02:02:29.608 --> 02:02:41.397]  But look here, Doctor, wouldn't this nucleus of survivors be so grief-stricken and anguished that they'd, well, envy the dead and not want to go on living?
[02:02:41.397 --> 02:02:42.839]  No, sir.
[02:02:42.839 --> 02:02:43.299]  Excuse me.
[02:02:53.425 --> 02:02:57.449]  Also, when they go down into the mine, everyone will still be alive!
[02:02:57.449 --> 02:03:04.275]  There will be no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion will be one of nostalgia for those left behind.
[02:03:04.275 --> 02:03:09.460]  Combined with a spirit of bold curiosity for the adventure ahead!
[02:03:27.728 --> 02:03:31.349]  Yeah.
[02:03:31.349 --> 02:03:37.371]  You mentioned the ratio of ten women to each man.
[02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:43.832]  Wouldn't that necessitate the abandonment of the so-called monogamous sexual relationship?
[02:03:43.832 --> 02:03:47.333]  I mean, as far as men were concerned.
[02:03:47.333 --> 02:03:48.894]  Regrettably, yes.
[02:03:48.894 --> 02:03:53.295]  But it is, you know, a sacrifice required for the future of the human race.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:04:11.110]  I hasten to add that since each man will be required to do prodigious service along these lines, the women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics, which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature.
[02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:16.193]  I must confess, you have an astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.
[02:04:16.193 --> 02:04:18.254]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:18.254 --> 02:04:20.416]  I think we ought to look at this from a military point of view.
[02:04:20.416 --> 02:04:20.596]  I mean,
[02:04:23.314 --> 02:04:26.378]  Supposing the Ruskies stashed away some big bombs, see?
[02:04:26.378 --> 02:04:27.439]  And we didn't.
[02:04:27.439 --> 02:04:30.503]  When they come out in a hundred years, they could take over!
[02:04:30.503 --> 02:04:31.364]  I agree, Mr. President.
[02:04:32.250 --> 02:04:35.973]  In fact, they might even try an immediate sneak attack so they could take over our mineshaft space.
[02:04:35.973 --> 02:04:43.579]  Yeah, I think it would be extremely naive of us, Mr. President, to imagine that these new developments are going to cause any change in Soviet expansionist policy.
[02:04:43.579 --> 02:04:54.168]  I mean, we must be increasingly on the alert to prevent them from taking over other mineshaft space, in order to breed more prodigiously than we do, thus knocking us out to superior numbers when we emerge.
[02:04:54.168 --> 02:05:01.293]  Mr. President, we must not allow a mineshaft gu- Well, I just want to say, that's all right for us.
[02:05:02.557 --> 02:05:04.399]  Diet force is amazing!
[02:05:04.399 --> 02:05:10.004]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:05:10.004 --> 02:05:12.586]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[02:05:12.586 --> 02:05:18.952]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:05:18.952 --> 02:05:21.154]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:05:22.330 --> 02:05:25.171]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.
[02:05:25.171 --> 02:05:27.332]  DietForce is the go.
[02:05:27.332 --> 02:05:30.233]  You have to get the DietForce and have two a day.
[02:05:30.233 --> 02:05:31.994]  And just keep at it.

[02:05:44.218 --> 02:05:45.738]  God bless Australia.

[02:06:12.286 --> 02:06:18.688]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.688 --> 02:06:25.550]  While I was sitting here going to break minutes ago,
[02:06:29.051 --> 02:06:32.714]  A bunch of sonic booms happened and almost blew out the windows.
[02:06:32.714 --> 02:06:35.336]  We thought bombs went off here.
[02:06:35.336 --> 02:06:41.862]  And there is Twitter in Austin saying that jets flew over and just did.
[02:06:41.862 --> 02:06:49.828]  I mean, a jet flew over our office at probably 500 feet with a sonic boom that almost blew the windows out.
[02:06:49.828 --> 02:06:53.931]  We're talking about minutes ago.
[02:06:53.931 --> 02:06:55.573]  Fighter jets fly by overhead.
[02:06:56.986 --> 02:06:59.007]  So, this never goes on.
[02:06:59.007 --> 02:07:00.268]  This never happens.
[02:07:00.268 --> 02:07:10.335]  I've been in this office 14 years, and I've seen helicopters, I've seen it all, but I've not seen jets fly over, over Austin on purpose, and then break the sound barrier.
[02:07:10.335 --> 02:07:14.839]  This just happened right off the border of Ukraine a few days ago.
[02:07:14.839 --> 02:07:16.340]  Here's some video of it.
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:18.441]  But they weren't breaking the sound barrier.
[02:07:18.441 --> 02:07:23.745]  This was just done in Austin minutes ago.
[02:07:23.745 --> 02:07:25.346]  Outside our office right now, that's going on.
[02:07:32.970 --> 02:07:37.355]  And I was asking the crew, I was like, during the break, get on air and they go, get on air and tell them what?
[02:07:37.355 --> 02:07:39.777]  Thank God Twitter is showing it all.
[02:07:39.777 --> 02:07:42.720]  Because God forbid reporters actually get on air and tell you what they saw.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:49.908]  But, I mean, that just adds to the flavor of what's going on and unfolding right now.
[02:07:49.908 --> 02:07:52.951]  Bro, a fighter jet just flew directly over my job in Austin.
[02:07:54.471 --> 02:07:57.573]  I thought I was Bonafide Dye, it was so loud.
[02:07:57.573 --> 02:07:59.454]  Well it did sonic booms, it wasn't just one jet.
[02:07:59.454 --> 02:08:01.636]  It was boom, boom, boom!
[02:08:01.636 --> 02:08:03.897]  And when they went out, more jets were flying around.
[02:08:03.897 --> 02:08:12.803]  So what you just saw happening in Europe is going on in Austin right now with jets reportedly over down, we're not in downtown, they're over downtown right now doing it.
[02:08:12.803 --> 02:08:18.967]  So why would the Pentagon order out of San Antonio, the big air bases, the former Strategic Air Command is
[02:08:20.578 --> 02:08:22.939]  The airport out here, Berkshire Airport.
[02:08:22.939 --> 02:08:24.280]  Why are they swarming around?
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:29.842]  Why are they right now over Austin, sonic booms flying 500 feet above the buildings?
[02:08:29.842 --> 02:08:32.503]  It's all part of the fear, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:32.503 --> 02:08:35.364]  They're ordering these pilots to do this.
[02:08:35.364 --> 02:08:36.425]  Absolutely insane.
[02:08:36.425 --> 02:08:39.946]  All right, let's go to the calls, the order they are received.
[02:08:39.946 --> 02:08:42.107]  Who's up next here?
[02:08:42.107 --> 02:08:43.568]  Daniel in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:08:45.686 --> 02:08:47.987]  Hey, thank you, Alex Jones.
[02:08:47.987 --> 02:08:50.967]  May Father Yahweh bless you and all of your loved ones.
[02:08:50.967 --> 02:08:53.508]  Thank you.
[02:08:53.508 --> 02:08:56.589]  Well, I know that you love all your listeners, too.
[02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:58.750]  So that bounces right back to me.
[02:08:58.750 --> 02:09:00.170]  See how that works?
[02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:02.551]  See how that works?
[02:09:02.551 --> 02:09:05.832]  Wow, fighter pilot above your building.
[02:09:05.832 --> 02:09:07.172]  That's, uh, that's crazy.
[02:09:08.414 --> 02:09:15.897]  I wonder if chasing one of those secret Chinese drones Mike Adams and others have reported about.
[02:09:15.897 --> 02:09:19.859]  That's nuts, my beloved brother.
[02:09:19.859 --> 02:09:25.722]  Anyways, I'm glad you talked about Dr. Strangelove because it gives me a perfect segue.
[02:09:25.722 --> 02:09:37.547]  If you remember, in the movie, Strangelove forms the panel about the Soviet's doomsday machine.
[02:09:38.402 --> 02:09:43.813]  That was programmed to detonate automatically and cannot be deactivated.
[02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:47.671]  Alright, so that brings me to what I want to talk about.
[02:09:47.671 --> 02:09:53.315]  AI and Cyber Satan is running this whole thing, and I don't think we talk about it enough.
[02:09:53.315 --> 02:10:06.324]  You know, you got guys on like Leo Zoghami and Cyrus Parza and Jay Dyer that get into it some, but we look too much at these flesh puppets in the Davos Group and the WEF.
[02:10:06.324 --> 02:10:13.949]  You know, we call them globalists, we call them world banksters, but they're really getting their orders from this first generation
[02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:15.609]  A.I.
[02:10:15.609 --> 02:10:16.269]  engine.
[02:10:16.269 --> 02:10:19.030]  That's why a lot of these moves don't even make no sense.
[02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:26.912]  This, you know, like drag scream story hour and litter boxes in the bathroom and things like a kid's bathroom.
[02:10:26.912 --> 02:10:31.073]  These moves don't make sense because it's coming from a stupid computer.
[02:10:31.073 --> 02:10:32.494]  And we're letting it happen.
[02:10:32.494 --> 02:10:37.675]  You know, and I wish that you would have a guy on named Steven Van Noon as the Raley News Live.
[02:10:38.175 --> 02:10:45.618]  You know, he's had Cyrus Parsons on, he's had Dave Hodges on, he's had Dr. Artis on.
[02:10:45.618 --> 02:10:54.802]  He's got a lot of good intel about the cyber Satan and about Trump having investments in vaccines and being a flesh puppet as well.
[02:10:54.802 --> 02:11:02.866]  I also wish that you would interview Henry Maycall about the protocols of the elders of Zion.
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:09.065]  And I disagree with you on Trump.
[02:11:09.065 --> 02:11:12.287]  Once a vaccine pimp, always a vaccine pimp.
[02:11:12.287 --> 02:11:15.330]  He's an installed Zionist.
[02:11:15.330 --> 02:11:16.391]  He's a Jesuit.
[02:11:16.391 --> 02:11:18.553]  He's a 33rd degree Freemason.
[02:11:18.553 --> 02:11:24.398]  I know there's a certain flavor of Freemasonry that you can't kind of stick up for because your family roots.
[02:11:24.398 --> 02:11:27.340]  And I understand that, my beloved brother, because I come from...
[02:11:28.661 --> 02:11:29.821]  I'm not a Mason.
[02:11:29.821 --> 02:11:31.182]  I'm not involved with the Masons.
[02:11:31.182 --> 02:11:33.202]  I just don't think all Masons are involved in this.
[02:11:33.202 --> 02:11:34.763]  George Washington was a Mason.
[02:11:34.763 --> 02:11:35.503]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:35.503 --> 02:11:37.544]  We've got to move the next person.
[02:11:37.544 --> 02:11:39.124]  But I'm glad you made your points.
[02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:42.625]  All I know is there's a bunch of fighter jets flying around right now over Austin.
[02:11:42.625 --> 02:11:43.585]  It's all over the news.
[02:11:43.585 --> 02:11:45.446]  So why are they doing that?
[02:11:45.446 --> 02:11:46.286]  It's to create fear.
[02:11:46.286 --> 02:11:49.407]  It's to create... They have plenty of places to go fly and do that.
[02:11:49.407 --> 02:11:52.708]  Why are they in the biggest city in Texas, or the second biggest city, doing that?
[02:11:52.708 --> 02:11:54.848]  That's a big question.
[02:11:54.848 --> 02:11:55.629]  Tom in New York.
[02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:56.589]  Thanks for holding your own here.
[02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:57.049]  Go ahead, Tom.
[02:11:58.243 --> 02:12:00.644]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:12:00.644 --> 02:12:03.886]  I did receive my shipment of real red pills.
[02:12:03.886 --> 02:12:05.787]  Boy, I love you for it.
[02:12:05.787 --> 02:12:18.954]  Anyways, I was in the Air Force back in the 70s, and I was stationed out at Vandenberg Air Base, which is central to SpaceX and everything else.
[02:12:18.954 --> 02:12:25.757]  Arthur Schlesinger used to be running around our command all the time.
[02:12:25.757 --> 02:12:27.258]  I mean, him and his little white hat.
[02:12:28.575 --> 02:12:41.966]  But at any rate, what I really wanted to get into is this dystopian situation we're into right now where you've got these people, my own family.
[02:12:41.966 --> 02:12:50.572]  I have a nephew that just graduated out of boot camp for the Marines, and he's been home for now two months.
[02:12:50.572 --> 02:12:55.756]  And they keep telling him, just hold on, hold on, you know, we're going to full pay and this and that.
[02:12:56.789 --> 02:13:05.775]  Just enjoy your time, and he's in artillery, so I fully expect him to get sent over to Ukraine.
[02:13:05.775 --> 02:13:07.416]  I've warned my brother about it.
[02:13:07.416 --> 02:13:14.840]  It causes great angst, because he's not aware of what's going on.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.603]  Well, George Soros just came out and said yesterday, the war started, it's full warm,
[02:13:20.768 --> 02:13:21.188]  The U.S.
[02:13:21.188 --> 02:13:25.990]  has conscripted Eastern Europeans so Americans don't know there's a war with Russia.
[02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:30.652]  What is Soros thinking at 95 years old or whatever he is?
[02:13:30.652 --> 02:13:40.455]  Oh, George Soros, I mean, listen, if people don't know who he is and what he stands for, they're lost.
[02:13:40.455 --> 02:13:42.676]  You're not gonna save them, okay?
[02:13:42.676 --> 02:13:47.098]  These folks are so brainwashed, it's impossible.
[02:13:48.748 --> 02:13:56.350]  The only thing I got to say is you had Ivan Reikland on last week and what a great interview.
[02:13:56.350 --> 02:13:58.711]  You need to keep that commander close to you.
[02:13:58.711 --> 02:13:59.611]  He's a great guy.
[02:13:59.611 --> 02:14:01.231]  God bless you, Tom.
[02:14:01.231 --> 02:14:02.772]  Terry in Nova Scotia, Canada.
[02:14:02.772 --> 02:14:03.212]  You're on the air.
[02:14:03.212 --> 02:14:05.012]  Thanks for calling.
[02:14:05.012 --> 02:14:05.533]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:05.533 --> 02:14:06.353]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:14:06.353 --> 02:14:06.633]  I can.
[02:14:06.633 --> 02:14:08.393]  Go ahead.
[02:14:08.393 --> 02:14:08.933]  Hey, real quick.
[02:14:08.933 --> 02:14:14.695]  I just wanted to say on the topic of World War III, first of all, everything in the media in Canada
[02:14:15.356 --> 02:14:36.886]  Is pro-war right now, and our media in Canada, for the American listeners who might not have heard of this, our media in Canada is literally owned, funded, and operated by our government, the CBC, is what the media agency here is called, and it's all pro-war, and I think what you said earlier actually really made sense, that the endgame is to position China as the new world leader, because that's what the
[02:14:37.861 --> 02:14:41.142]  You know, the corporate lobbyists, long story short, probably want, right?
[02:14:41.142 --> 02:14:45.684]  Because they can make the most money there with the labor conditions over there compared to North America.
[02:14:45.684 --> 02:14:48.105]  So I just wanted to say that, bro.
[02:14:48.105 --> 02:14:50.106]  And also, secondly, I love you.
[02:14:50.106 --> 02:15:00.449]  I first discovered you during the Iraq War back then, and I hope you don't hate me for saying this, but brother, for what is about to come in the next couple years, you are doing the best shows ever.
[02:15:00.449 --> 02:15:06.772]  You are giving your most powerful messages ever, but we need you off those cigarettes for the next few years, brother, because we need you at full health, brother.
[02:15:06.772 --> 02:15:07.172]  I love you.
[02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:11.252]  What are Sin Reps?
[02:15:11.252 --> 02:15:11.812]  Cigarettes.
[02:15:11.812 --> 02:15:12.333]  Sorry, brother.
[02:15:12.333 --> 02:15:13.253]  Cigarettes.
[02:15:13.253 --> 02:15:20.398]  Oh, you know, I haven't smoked in like 14 years, and I did start back occasional cigarette like a year ago.
[02:15:20.398 --> 02:15:23.400]  And I'm actually almost out with cigarettes right now.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:25.202]  I hear you.
[02:15:25.202 --> 02:15:25.922]  Okay.
[02:15:25.922 --> 02:15:27.143]  Thank you, brother.
[02:15:27.143 --> 02:15:27.523]  Thank you.
[02:15:27.523 --> 02:15:29.605]  All right, we're gonna go on a break.
[02:15:29.605 --> 02:15:32.427]  And then Hopper and others, we're gonna jam with your calls.
[02:15:32.427 --> 02:15:35.049]  And then for the next hour, we've got a special guest in studio.
[02:15:36.644 --> 02:15:38.526]  Eric in Connecticut, you're up next.
[02:15:38.526 --> 02:15:41.868]  World War III, nuke strike from Russia, with Eric when we come back.
[02:15:41.868 --> 02:15:43.810]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:15:43.810 --> 02:15:46.052]  We are already at war with Russia.
[02:15:46.052 --> 02:15:48.554]  This is going down.
[02:15:48.554 --> 02:15:50.015]  And we have to be ready, folks.
[02:15:50.015 --> 02:15:50.396]  Stay with us.
[02:15:58.217 --> 02:15:59.858]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:15:59.858 --> 02:16:01.720]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:09.226]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[02:16:09.226 --> 02:16:13.949]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:16:13.949 --> 02:16:16.612]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:16:18.493 --> 02:16:23.176]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[02:16:23.176 --> 02:16:25.177]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:16:25.177 --> 02:16:26.998]  So please, keep me on the field.
[02:16:26.998 --> 02:16:32.222]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:49.594]  Please commit now to go to Infowarshore.com and get great products and make donations.

[02:16:51.756 --> 02:16:54.498]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[02:16:58.427 --> 02:17:02.969]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[02:17:02.969 --> 02:17:06.671]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:17.496]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[02:17:17.496 --> 02:17:18.797]  These products work great for women as well.
[02:17:19.457 --> 02:17:21.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[02:17:21.878 --> 02:17:24.340]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:30.143]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsHaw.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[02:17:30.143 --> 02:17:32.404]  They've also got HGH Max Boost.
[02:17:32.404 --> 02:17:33.705]  Read all about it.
[02:17:33.705 --> 02:17:35.206]  Be very safe with it.
[02:17:35.206 --> 02:17:38.508]  Take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[02:17:38.508 --> 02:17:40.029]  Don't do it during the day.
[02:17:40.029 --> 02:17:43.030]  1776 testosterone boost.
[02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:44.091]  Totally incredible.
[02:17:44.091 --> 02:17:45.031]  Go read about them.
[02:17:45.031 --> 02:17:45.812]  Learn more about them.
[02:17:46.152 --> 02:17:52.016]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[02:18:04.245 --> 02:18:17.237]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarStore.com right now and taking action.
[02:18:17.237 --> 02:18:22.161]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:18:22.581 --> 02:18:24.242]  Keep Info Wars on the air.
[02:18:24.242 --> 02:18:26.524]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:18:26.524 --> 02:18:28.005]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:18:28.005 --> 02:18:29.246]  They're coming for me.
[02:18:29.246 --> 02:18:30.487]  They're coming for the children.
[02:18:30.487 --> 02:18:33.069]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:18:33.069 --> 02:18:36.431]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:18:36.431 --> 02:18:37.732]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:18:37.972 --> 02:18:40.073]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:18:40.073 --> 02:18:45.495]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poise of shots.
[02:18:45.495 --> 02:18:49.417]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[02:18:49.417 --> 02:18:50.638]  Let's do it together.
[02:18:50.638 --> 02:18:52.919]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:18:52.919 --> 02:18:56.740]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:57.721]  Now take action now!
[02:18:58.081 --> 02:18:59.922]  Infowars is winning.
[02:18:59.922 --> 02:19:01.963]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:19:01.963 --> 02:19:04.744]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:19:04.744 --> 02:19:07.485]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:19:07.485 --> 02:19:09.586]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:19:09.586 --> 02:19:11.667]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:19:11.667 --> 02:19:12.627]  None of that's true.
[02:19:12.627 --> 02:19:13.528]  It's all being appealed.
[02:19:14.008 --> 02:19:22.972]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:19:22.972 --> 02:19:26.414]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:19:26.414 --> 02:19:29.115]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[02:19:29.115 --> 02:19:39.000]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:40.820]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:45.242]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:19:45.242 --> 02:19:49.323]  Because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:19:49.323 --> 02:19:52.704]  The majority of you have not been silenced, but some of you have.
[02:19:52.704 --> 02:19:54.665]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[02:19:54.665 --> 02:19:59.406]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:19:59.406 --> 02:20:05.308]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:12.797]  All right.
[02:20:12.797 --> 02:20:17.641]  I have crew members getting calls in Oklahoma.
[02:20:17.641 --> 02:20:18.822]  What city did you say?
[02:20:18.822 --> 02:20:19.822]  Oklahoma City.
[02:20:19.822 --> 02:20:21.083]  And it's all over Twitter.
[02:20:21.083 --> 02:20:22.244]  Jets are doing sound barrier
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:40.941]  I'm good.
[02:20:53.885 --> 02:20:55.986]  This is absolutely a psychological operation.
[02:20:55.986 --> 02:20:58.586]  We can do a whole show on why are they doing this.
[02:20:58.586 --> 02:21:00.687]  I'm sure during the war room at 3 p.m.
[02:21:00.687 --> 02:21:03.588]  today, in about an hour and 40 minutes, they'll be covering this.
[02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:04.568]  But this is crazy.
[02:21:04.568 --> 02:21:05.688]  They're breaking the sound barrier.
[02:21:05.688 --> 02:21:07.289]  They're not supposed to fly over cities.
[02:21:07.289 --> 02:21:10.570]  They're being ordered to fly like 500 feet above our office.
[02:21:10.570 --> 02:21:14.031]  Sound barrier being broken.
[02:21:14.031 --> 02:21:16.151]  What in the hell is going on?
[02:21:16.151 --> 02:21:17.652]  All right, who's up next here in order?
[02:21:17.652 --> 02:21:19.352]  We've taken these calls.
[02:21:19.352 --> 02:21:21.853]  Would that be... Say that again?
[02:21:23.234 --> 02:21:26.716]  Eric in Connecticut, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:21:26.716 --> 02:21:27.996]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:21:27.996 --> 02:21:30.317]  Yes sir.
[02:21:30.317 --> 02:21:39.962]  So a while back on your show, you had a frequent guest, Joel Skousen, who is always very knowledgeable about the Grand Conspiracy.
[02:21:39.962 --> 02:21:48.566]  And it must have been about ten years ago, but he said at the time that the West was going to try to elicit a nuclear first strike from Russia.
[02:21:49.449 --> 02:21:53.872]  At the time, I thought it was preposterous, and now it seems self-evident.
[02:21:53.872 --> 02:22:00.156]  But then Joel went back on that and said that Putin was trying to reconstitute the Soviet Union.
[02:22:00.156 --> 02:22:06.700]  But it seems like his original claim was correct, that we're trying to elicit a nuclear first strike.
[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:12.243]  That's right, he said around 2023, 2024, 2025, the globalists would trick Russia into a first strike, and we're here.
[02:22:13.675 --> 02:22:15.656]  Yeah, and that's exactly where we are.
[02:22:15.656 --> 02:22:23.698]  Why do you think that he backed off of that and started parroting the propaganda that Putin is going to reconstitute the Soviet Union?
[02:22:23.698 --> 02:22:26.479]  Hey, let's get Joel Skousen on tomorrow and talk about it.
[02:22:26.479 --> 02:22:27.639]  He's a smart guy.
[02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:28.999]  I don't know the answer.
[02:22:28.999 --> 02:22:36.161]  Yeah, I just think that we're definitely barreling towards the apocalypse, Armageddon.
[02:22:39.534 --> 02:22:46.879]  With the pandemic and now this war and then we're going to have famine and then, you know, followed by death.
[02:22:46.879 --> 02:22:58.668]  It's obviously some sort of depopulation, but the West seems to want to decapitate the United States militarily and itself to put China up on top.
[02:22:58.668 --> 02:22:59.248]  Well, that's right.
[02:22:59.248 --> 02:23:01.109]  This whole project is about bringing the U.S.
[02:23:01.109 --> 02:23:01.369]  down.
[02:23:01.369 --> 02:23:01.870]  Make no mistake.
[02:23:02.341 --> 02:23:03.742]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:03.742 --> 02:23:07.643]  And I hope that's not the case like your other caller said.
[02:23:07.643 --> 02:23:09.844]  We have to do something to stop this.
[02:23:09.844 --> 02:23:19.808]  And hopefully that we can get the word out that this warmongering is a dead end for the United States, for the West, and for freedom.
[02:23:19.808 --> 02:23:20.368]  It is, Eric.
[02:23:20.368 --> 02:23:20.908]  Great points.
[02:23:20.908 --> 02:23:22.309]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:27.651]  We're going to go to Hopper in a minute, but first let's take another call from Tim in Florida.
[02:23:27.651 --> 02:23:27.911]  Go ahead.
[02:23:29.178 --> 02:23:37.582]  Hello Alex, I want to talk to you about this war as it pertains to regionalization, and you mentioned Kissinger's plan.
[02:23:37.582 --> 02:23:41.443]  He called, he talked about a coming new mercantilism.
[02:23:41.443 --> 02:23:43.704]  That's a very important topic.
[02:23:43.704 --> 02:23:45.865]  Now Alex, I go back a long way with you.
[02:23:45.865 --> 02:23:53.148]  I first listened to you on Steve Williams' radio station WVTJ here in Pensacola back in the 90s.
[02:23:53.148 --> 02:23:57.610]  I bought your products and videos over the years, and I also had a video, Blockheads,
[02:23:58.226 --> 02:24:02.989]  That was a finalist in your Paul Revere video contest in 2013.
[02:24:02.989 --> 02:24:13.615]  That video was about regionalization, the globalist incremental plan to develop other regional blocs like the EU around the world.
[02:24:13.615 --> 02:24:20.079]  But regionalization was derailed almost single-handedly by President Trump and the nationalist movement.
[02:24:20.079 --> 02:24:21.140]  But now it's back.
[02:24:21.815 --> 02:24:23.536]  It was part of Schwab's Great Recess.
[02:24:23.536 --> 02:24:29.081]  And that's why they say globalism is dead, because globalism was always meant to isolate us and lock things down.
[02:24:29.081 --> 02:24:30.222]  We want open, free society.
[02:24:30.222 --> 02:24:31.643]  This is the opposite.
[02:24:31.643 --> 02:24:36.407]  This is meant to fragment the world into these regional blocks.
[02:24:36.407 --> 02:24:48.577]  And on pages 83 and 84 of Schwab's book, he promoted regionalization as globalism's post-COVID compromise with nationalism.
[02:24:48.577 --> 02:24:50.659]  He wrote that regional blocks like the EU
[02:24:51.238 --> 02:24:56.202]  And regional supply chains, and that's important for this upcoming war footing.
[02:24:56.202 --> 02:25:04.688]  Regional supply chains would be a compromise in-between solution, a new watered-down version of globalization.
[02:25:04.688 --> 02:25:11.353]  So, regionalization, Alex, is Schwab's synthesis between globalism and nationalism.
[02:25:11.353 --> 02:25:14.835]  Now, you mentioned Kissinger's plan.
[02:25:14.835 --> 02:25:17.878]  He spelled out his plan in that infamous
[02:25:18.829 --> 02:25:25.155]  New York Times op-ed back in 2009 after Obama was elected, the chance for a new world order.
[02:25:25.155 --> 02:25:28.398]  Kissinger gave the world an ultimatum in that op-ed.
[02:25:28.398 --> 02:25:42.772]  He said that the world would either accept a world government, he called it an international political regulatory system, or he warned the world would fragment into what he called a new mercantilism
[02:25:43.425 --> 02:25:45.245]  of competing regional units.
[02:25:45.245 --> 02:25:47.326]  Now, Alex, you're a student of history.
[02:25:47.326 --> 02:25:50.127]  You remember historic mercantilism.
[02:25:50.127 --> 02:25:56.388]  You had the English Empire and the French Empire and the Spanish Empire, all these empires.
[02:25:56.388 --> 02:26:09.851]  The pretext for the consolidation of power and the harnessing of all the resources within each one of those empires, they were built up because of threats from the other empires.
[02:26:10.791 --> 02:26:15.254]  And so they pitted the empires against each other, and each one of them benefited.
[02:26:15.254 --> 02:26:19.657]  And that's exactly what Kissinger is talking about, a new mercantilism.
[02:26:19.657 --> 02:26:23.979]  But instead of these old empires, it's going to be regional blocs.
[02:26:23.979 --> 02:26:25.420]  And it's not going to be just three.
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:27.601]  Tim, you're a super smart guy, and I love our callers.
[02:26:27.601 --> 02:26:28.562]  You're very impressive.
[02:26:28.562 --> 02:26:29.623]  How do you think this is going to end?
[02:26:29.623 --> 02:26:30.923]  Are they going to stop?
[02:26:30.923 --> 02:26:35.306]  I think it'll be, as Lincoln Bloomfield said in 1962,
[02:26:37.205 --> 02:26:47.452]  He said that this world government wouldn't come about unless they built regional blocks first, but that won't come.
[02:26:47.452 --> 02:26:51.815]  He said it'll take 200 years, but he said that can be short-circuited with
[02:26:54.013 --> 02:26:58.735]  Hey Mr. Jones, I think next up in the hopper here with the shake-and-bake strategy from the West, NATO and the U.S.
[02:26:58.735 --> 02:27:01.496]  is that they're falling into a tank trap where like the escalation is going to increase from
[02:27:23.829 --> 02:27:35.377]  Javelins and drones, artillery to armored personnel carriers to now tanks, and they're sending tanks, main battle tanks, into an area where Russia has air superiority.
[02:27:35.377 --> 02:27:38.159]  So those tanks are going to have a big issue with that and the artillery.
[02:27:38.159 --> 02:27:43.222]  And then when they're getting knocked out and there's burning... This is bringing the air cover.
[02:27:43.222 --> 02:27:43.722]  Exactly.
[02:27:43.722 --> 02:27:44.943]  It's a threat escalation.
[02:27:44.943 --> 02:27:46.324]  Which of the jets you're seeing.
[02:27:46.324 --> 02:27:51.788]  And this, you know, this is part of a, you know, greater, more ancient war against Christianity.
[02:27:52.746 --> 02:27:59.689]  Um, through dark forces, you know, a lot of people forget to realize we're in the year of the rabbit.
[02:27:59.689 --> 02:28:07.371]  And, you know, it's going to be a wild year full of rabbit holes and people forget the rabbit hole of where the original pyramids are.
[02:28:07.371 --> 02:28:14.934]  And the original pyramids are actually ancient Slavic pyramids in the Balkans that are twice to three times the size
[02:28:15.706 --> 02:28:16.927]  of the ones in Egypt.
[02:28:37.239 --> 02:28:39.100]  So they're using this as a smoke screen.
[02:28:39.100 --> 02:28:41.801]  Bottom line, World War III has begun.
[02:28:41.801 --> 02:28:43.242]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:43.242 --> 02:28:44.763]  All right, special guests in studio.
[02:28:44.763 --> 02:28:46.543]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:28:46.543 --> 02:28:47.724]  Make no mistake.
[02:28:47.724 --> 02:28:49.885]  The New World Order's here, folks.
[02:28:49.885 --> 02:28:50.986]  We live to see it.
[02:28:50.986 --> 02:28:51.486]  Stay with us.
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:04.484]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[02:29:04.484 --> 02:29:12.869]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[02:29:12.869 --> 02:29:15.111]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[02:29:15.111 --> 02:29:18.593]  Now that was a three-coin series, the founding member coin.
[02:29:18.593 --> 02:29:21.975]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[02:29:22.696 --> 02:29:29.404]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com?
[02:29:29.404 --> 02:29:35.192]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[02:29:35.192 --> 02:29:38.416]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[02:29:38.456 --> 02:29:39.357]  We're good to go.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:02.762]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.

[02:30:24.951 --> 02:30:27.132]  All of these compounds are documented on record
[02:30:27.592 --> 02:30:28.253]  We're good to go.
[02:30:57.992 --> 02:31:01.034]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[02:31:01.034 --> 02:31:03.815]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.

[02:32:54.698 --> 02:32:55.539]  InfoWars Platinum.
[02:32:55.819 --> 02:33:00.085]  Now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:33:00.085 --> 02:33:05.993]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.713 --> 02:33:17.597]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:33:17.597 --> 02:33:25.522]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:33:25.522 --> 02:33:27.603]  As president, I will make it clear.
[02:33:28.483 --> 02:33:33.786]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:33:33.786 --> 02:33:39.188]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:33:39.188 --> 02:33:42.770]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:45.611]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:33:45.611 --> 02:33:48.192]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:33:50.581 --> 02:33:52.963]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:33:52.963 --> 02:33:56.626]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:33:56.626 --> 02:34:04.532]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:34:06.454 --> 02:34:06.954]  The U.S.
[02:34:06.954 --> 02:34:10.938]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[02:34:10.938 --> 02:34:18.924]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:34:18.924 --> 02:34:21.367]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:34:21.367 --> 02:34:26.010]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[02:34:26.010 --> 02:34:30.014]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:34:30.014 --> 02:34:32.256]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[02:34:36.101 --> 02:34:40.498]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:08.621]  Yeah.
[02:35:29.736 --> 02:35:41.359]  Alright, so I'm sitting here about 40 minutes ago, and we're going to break, and there's sonic booms, the building shakes, and I love the crew, they're great, but a lot of them are reporters.
[02:35:41.359 --> 02:35:49.321]  And I say, hey, I want you to go in the control room and talk about what you just saw in the window shake, and they said, oh, you just talk about it.
[02:35:49.321 --> 02:35:50.921]  Okay, well great, I'll talk about it.
[02:35:50.921 --> 02:35:58.103]  But it sounds crazy to sit there and say that, but then it's all over Twitter, it's not just here, it's other parts of the country.
[02:35:59.355 --> 02:36:07.498]  F-18s, F-16s, F-15s, flying over at 500-1000 feet, sonic booms, rattling the buildings.
[02:36:07.498 --> 02:36:13.580]  They're doing drills of targeting targets inside cities ahead of what's happening on the border of Russia right now.
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:19.202]  But, Tyler Bennett is the guest here with us to cover the waterfront on the new IRS rules and the rest of it.
[02:36:19.202 --> 02:36:20.942]  And so, he will tell you what he saw.
[02:36:20.942 --> 02:36:22.303]  Go ahead, tell us what you heard.
[02:36:22.563 --> 02:36:29.925]  Well Alex, it was crazy because about half an hour ago we did hear this large sonic boom here over Austin.
[02:36:29.925 --> 02:36:30.525]  And you know what?
[02:36:30.525 --> 02:36:37.207]  It fits in perfectly with the fear that the regime is trying to give the people.
[02:36:37.207 --> 02:36:38.667]  Because Alex is right.
[02:36:38.667 --> 02:36:41.588]  When they're flying over cities, American cities like that,
[02:36:42.088 --> 02:36:45.049]  That's what they're practicing on attacking, right?
[02:36:45.049 --> 02:36:50.072]  And so the only reason they would do that is to strike fear into the populace.
[02:36:50.072 --> 02:36:53.593]  A populace that is controlled by fear is controlled.
[02:36:53.593 --> 02:36:58.635]  And as we all know, the other way they control you, and it's tax time again, is through your money.
[02:36:58.635 --> 02:37:02.737]  Because all those M1 Abrams tanks are not cheap, and guess who's paying it?
[02:37:02.737 --> 02:37:04.458]  You and me.
[02:37:04.458 --> 02:37:06.279]  It's crazy, but it's not just here.
[02:37:06.279 --> 02:37:06.999]  It's in Oklahoma.
[02:37:06.999 --> 02:37:09.900]  We're getting reports out of California, New York.
[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:11.241]  Why suddenly do they have
[02:37:12.731 --> 02:37:15.066]  Military jets do drills of strifing targets.
[02:37:16.192 --> 02:37:24.978]  The only reason they would do that, Alex, is because they believe that there could be some kind of conflict here in America that they're going to use that force against.
[02:37:24.978 --> 02:37:27.540]  I remember it came out like eight years ago.
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:30.001]  Obama was thinking about using jets against the American people.
[02:37:30.001 --> 02:37:30.522]  That's right.
[02:37:30.522 --> 02:37:32.283]  And so the same thing's happening here.
[02:37:32.283 --> 02:37:35.105]  The Democratic regime is back in control.
[02:37:35.105 --> 02:37:38.207]  They used to call him Obama for a reason.
[02:37:38.207 --> 02:37:41.589]  And now Biden is apparently headed down the same path.
[02:37:41.589 --> 02:37:43.551]  He said, I'm really good at killing people with drones.
[02:37:44.191 --> 02:38:01.416]  Exactly, and it's been mentioned before, but we've taken most of the humanity out of the military, and now all these attacks are done by machines that do not have a conscious, that do exactly what they are told to do, with no regard to human life whatsoever.
[02:38:01.416 --> 02:38:08.458]  Alright, you've been so busy in the last month, you can only come on one time, but I wanted to get you here, just talk about big picture.
[02:38:09.526 --> 02:38:16.970]  And what's happening in the tax system and how so many listeners are like, hey, the IRS is unconstitutional.
[02:38:16.970 --> 02:38:18.311]  The 16th Amendment is a fraud.
[02:38:18.311 --> 02:38:19.171]  I'm not going to pay it.
[02:38:19.171 --> 02:38:21.353]  Hey, if that's what you're going to do, that's your decision.
[02:38:23.206 --> 02:38:24.707]  That more power to you?
[02:38:24.707 --> 02:38:25.647]  I agree it's a fraud.
[02:38:25.647 --> 02:38:28.548]  We're not debating whether the income tax is a fraud.
[02:38:28.548 --> 02:38:31.829]  I support legislation that introduced the House to abolish the IRS.
[02:38:31.829 --> 02:38:34.810]  But they passed this law getting rid of 87,000 IRS agents.
[02:38:34.810 --> 02:38:36.810]  The Senate, they passed it in the House.
[02:38:36.810 --> 02:38:38.010]  The Senate has not passed that.
[02:38:38.010 --> 02:38:39.291]  So I'm being a realist here.
[02:38:40.211 --> 02:38:55.158]  Use the tricks the establishment has to mitigate and cut your taxes down if you're not going to go the route of going completely rogue, which with this rogue government, I'm not attacking you, I understand why you're doing it, and I get you, I support you.
[02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:57.799]  Just know the mafia will break your legs.
[02:38:57.799 --> 02:39:01.161]  And so we saw new numbers two weeks ago that made a lot of attention, and they should have,
[02:39:01.997 --> 02:39:02.538]  Thank you.
[02:39:21.354 --> 02:39:26.998]  National and all the team you've got, you got 75 year old tax lawyer experts working for you.
[02:39:26.998 --> 02:39:34.443]  We're gonna have your partner and co-owner on the next few weeks that have been doing this for decades that understand how to protect people.
[02:39:34.443 --> 02:39:38.746]  So if people want a mitigating effect, they should really do it with jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:39:38.746 --> 02:39:39.527]  That takes you there 800-869-0723.
[02:39:39.527 --> 02:39:42.128]  They can answer all your questions.
[02:39:42.128 --> 02:39:44.350]  It really is a smart thing for folks to do.
[02:39:48.004 --> 02:39:48.905]  That's right, Alex.
[02:39:48.905 --> 02:39:59.873]  And so we have seen legislation hit Congress right now where they're talking about, you know, abolishing the income tax and having a flat sales tax, right?
[02:39:59.873 --> 02:40:03.036]  And McCarthy changed his opinion on that yesterday.
[02:40:03.456 --> 02:40:11.459]  And that goes back to the whole deep state politics things of they will say whatever they need to say at the time, but really there's two systems.
[02:40:11.459 --> 02:40:12.660]  It's them and us.
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:18.182]  And you need to keep that in mind because you're a taxpayer of the United States, not a globalist, not an elitist.
[02:40:18.182 --> 02:40:20.022]  There's two separate systems.
[02:40:20.022 --> 02:40:23.404]  They will say, the politicians will say whatever they need to.
[02:40:24.184 --> 02:40:26.725]  But reality is completely different.
[02:40:26.725 --> 02:40:40.509]  And the reality, as we can tell from the jets flying overhead, from the basic declarations of war, from the sending of billions of dollars worth of war equipment to Ukraine, that they want you to be scared.
[02:40:40.509 --> 02:40:46.251]  Because, like I said before, when you're scared, they can control you, and they can get more money out of you.
[02:40:46.251 --> 02:40:51.933]  Because if you're scared, and then you hear on the news the truth that the IRS has hired 87,000 people,
[02:40:54.274 --> 02:40:59.377]  7,000 of which are to answer the phones, the other 80,000 which are to audit the middle and lower classes.
[02:40:59.377 --> 02:41:07.502]  We know it's the middle and lower classes because the IRS has repeatedly said and found out in TIGDA audits, that's the organization that audits the IRS.
[02:41:07.502 --> 02:41:13.486]  And these new training videos have come out of them saying, we're going to get that pool cleaner, we're going to get that landscaper.
[02:41:13.926 --> 02:41:16.729]  That person making 40 grand a year, we're going to SWAT team them.
[02:41:16.729 --> 02:41:23.636]  They're literally hiring all these crazy goons with guns to go after a segment of the population paying less than 6% of the taxes.
[02:41:23.636 --> 02:41:24.036]  That's right.
[02:41:24.036 --> 02:41:26.138]  I mean, wow, what is that about?
[02:41:26.138 --> 02:41:33.746]  Well, remember, they... Because if you really want to get tax money, which they all have just printing money, you go after the ultra-rich who are exempt, basically.
[02:41:33.746 --> 02:41:35.127]  You don't go after working class people.
[02:41:35.347 --> 02:41:37.209]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[02:41:37.209 --> 02:41:44.518]  And the Biden administration, since day one, has tried to close the so-called tax gap by attacking the middle class.
[02:41:44.518 --> 02:41:50.586]  The tax gap is the difference in what the IRS is owed each year and what they actually get.
[02:41:50.586 --> 02:41:54.690]  And they're about a trillion dollars short last year, even though they posted record profits, by the way.
[02:41:55.351 --> 02:42:02.413]  Um, but that trillion dollars, Alex, could be used to pay for an entire program such as social security or defense.
[02:42:02.413 --> 02:42:04.933]  So it really is a substantial amount of money.
[02:42:04.933 --> 02:42:15.095]  And yes, if we just tax the people at the top a tiny bit more, most of them aren't even paying anything in income tax, that would close that gap so quickly.
[02:42:15.095 --> 02:42:17.956]  But it's hard to do that for the regime.
[02:42:17.956 --> 02:42:19.376]  It takes more effort.
[02:42:19.376 --> 02:42:20.597]  It takes more people.
[02:42:20.597 --> 02:42:21.857]  So there's three ways to do this.
[02:42:22.617 --> 02:42:35.921]  You can either be a top globalist 1 to the 1% and pay no tax, which nobody's part of that group, that we know, or you can use the tax system they wrote and learn their tricks against them, or you can go totally rogue, which I say more power to you, just know it's dangerous.
[02:42:35.921 --> 02:42:44.303]  So the question is, we're not telling you what to do, we're saying, okay, you're not Jeff Bezos, you're not Elon Musk, you're not Bill Gates, so you don't pay zero tax, basically.
[02:42:44.303 --> 02:42:45.984]  Musk pays a little because he agreed to.
[02:42:45.984 --> 02:42:46.784]  The other ones don't.
[02:42:47.504 --> 02:42:55.366]  Or you can go along and be a schmuck of overpay, or you can use tricks they have to mitigate it way down, and that's what you do at jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:42:55.366 --> 02:42:59.907]  Exactly, Alex, because... InfoWars has made history.
[02:42:59.907 --> 02:43:02.527]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[02:43:02.527 --> 02:43:09.149]  The globalists are being defeated on every front, and now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[02:43:09.149 --> 02:43:12.470]  Let's win the war, the information war.
[02:43:12.470 --> 02:43:14.430]  There's nothing you can do more important
[02:43:14.730 --> 02:43:15.471]  We're good to go!
[02:43:44.810 --> 02:43:49.596]  If you want the coin, it's exclusively available right now for a limited time at 1776coin.com.
[02:43:49.596 --> 02:43:50.598]  $30 off when you use promo code 1776.
[02:43:50.598 --> 02:43:51.759]  Thank you for your support.
[02:43:58.171 --> 02:44:07.337]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:16.483]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:44:17.023 --> 02:44:24.287]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owner's a fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[02:44:24.287 --> 02:44:29.089]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[02:44:29.089 --> 02:44:30.630]  And not just under one name.
[02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:36.133]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:44:36.133 --> 02:44:40.215]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:44:40.635 --> 02:44:42.516]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[02:44:42.516 --> 02:44:45.218]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[02:44:45.218 --> 02:44:48.060]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:49.861]  These things are incredible.
[02:44:49.861 --> 02:44:55.785]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[02:44:55.785 --> 02:44:57.646]  Get them at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:57.646 --> 02:45:10.155]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones's film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:45:12.957 --> 02:45:23.204]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:45:23.204 --> 02:45:35.033]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:45:35.033 --> 02:45:36.574]  This is why they attack us.
[02:45:37.054 --> 02:45:39.575]  This is why we need your support.
[02:45:39.575 --> 02:45:41.376]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:45:41.376 --> 02:45:43.556]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:43.556 --> 02:45:44.997]  Join the resistance.
[02:45:44.997 --> 02:45:46.297]  Buy products.
[02:45:46.297 --> 02:45:48.098]  Donate to the cause.
[02:45:48.098 --> 02:45:49.458]  Share the links.
[02:45:49.458 --> 02:45:51.879]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[02:45:51.879 --> 02:45:54.080]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:45:57.332 --> 02:45:59.514]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:45:59.514 --> 02:46:01.316]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:46:01.316 --> 02:46:03.378]  This is an information war.
[02:46:03.378 --> 02:46:08.083]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:46:08.083 --> 02:46:14.550]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[02:46:15.010 --> 02:46:15.770]  We're good to go.
[02:46:36.576 --> 02:46:44.498]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:46:44.498 --> 02:46:46.819]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:46:46.819 --> 02:46:48.659]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:46:48.659 --> 02:46:49.779]  We're going over the top.
[02:46:49.779 --> 02:46:51.300]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:54.320]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[02:47:00.228 --> 02:47:04.832]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:04.832 --> 02:47:06.133]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:47:12.734 --> 02:47:16.057]  GetaTaxLawyer.com is a great sponsor.
[02:47:16.057 --> 02:47:18.419]  And Tyler Bennett here at American Tax Relief is with us.
[02:47:18.419 --> 02:47:22.563]  You go to JonesTaxRelief.com and then we get the sponsorship and the credit.
[02:47:22.563 --> 02:47:30.131]  But they can really navigate you quickly, cut right to the chase with advice from a law firm, with CPAs, hundreds of employees all across the United States.
[02:47:30.131 --> 02:47:34.255]  If you decide to not be a 1-10-1 percenter that's exempt, which none of us are,
[02:47:35.335 --> 02:47:37.716]  Or you want to go totally rogue and the whole thing's a fraud.
[02:47:37.716 --> 02:47:38.556]  I get what you're doing.
[02:47:38.556 --> 02:47:39.857]  You know, I understand it.
[02:47:39.857 --> 02:47:41.037]  I think you're right.
[02:47:41.037 --> 02:47:41.797]  Or you can be like me.
[02:47:41.797 --> 02:47:43.778]  We've got to hire employees and still run an operation.
[02:47:43.778 --> 02:47:48.019]  You pay the mafia, but you do things that mitigate that up to 90%.
[02:47:48.019 --> 02:47:55.282]  So Tyler Bennett, what is this gear up against the working class about that Biden's put in place?
[02:47:55.882 --> 02:48:14.435]  Okay, so what the Biden regime has put in place with this bill that has funded the IRS and given him so much more manpower is, like I was saying, they have decided to purposely target the middle class small business owners because these are people that a lot of them
[02:48:14.955 --> 02:48:28.032]  We're on W-2s before and now because the changing economy, our new business owners or even the business owners that have been around for a while, the rules are changing because of the post-COVID economy.
[02:48:28.032 --> 02:48:30.615]  And because of that, the regime is
[02:48:31.656 --> 02:48:37.604]  Fully prepared and about to engage in a smash and grab against these small businesses.
[02:48:37.604 --> 02:48:43.731]  And by the way, they now admit in mainstream news, even CNN, Fox News, the last two years they've already targeted the poorest workers.
[02:48:43.731 --> 02:48:46.094]  So that's already happening, but they're escalating it.
[02:48:46.094 --> 02:48:46.795]  Correct.
[02:48:46.795 --> 02:48:48.497]  And if we look at those last two years,
[02:48:49.338 --> 02:48:55.862]  Mathematically, there's a 5 to 1 chance of the lower class getting audited to the upper class.
[02:48:55.862 --> 02:49:05.308]  And this is just getting worse this year because, like I said, they are powerful and they're bullies and they're going to go after the easy target.
[02:49:05.308 --> 02:49:10.452]  And so here is how we are battling the system, the regime.
[02:49:10.452 --> 02:49:16.696]  The way they are going after people is they are going to audit people en masse and make wild allegations.
[02:49:17.176 --> 02:49:17.256]  Yes.
[02:49:34.358 --> 02:49:36.919]  Audit protection for the next three years.
[02:49:36.919 --> 02:49:51.766]  If you're a small business owner, if you are new on a 1099, if you have deductions that the IRS is likely to challenge, which is anything that's going to give you a substantially lower liability, you are in the targeted group for audits.
[02:49:51.766 --> 02:49:56.088]  And if that is the case, we are offering audit protection for the next three years.
[02:49:56.088 --> 02:50:02.671]  You can sign up, and that means if the IRS or the state attempts to audit or attack or assess you in the next three years,
[02:50:03.331 --> 02:50:09.053]  You already have us representing you and we will handle it and make sure your rights are taken care of.
[02:50:09.053 --> 02:50:19.898]  So this is like that super popular stuff where people go out and they get the gun insurance unless they shoot a criminal in their house or business, then a law firm is going to... That's pretty much exactly right because...
[02:50:20.999 --> 02:50:31.647]  We don't know when that criminal is going to show in your house or if it is, but the insurance makes it so that you don't go to jail when somebody... And you've explained this to me and I've talked to other big tax lawyers, they say what you're saying is accurate.
[02:50:31.647 --> 02:50:35.010]  When they know a big firm is behind somebody, they move on to the next person almost always.
[02:50:35.010 --> 02:50:40.013]  So you get a few battles here and there, but that's why it's like so easy, because once they know you're there, it's...
[02:50:40.794 --> 02:50:46.298]  The reality of the situation is they're bullies and they are looking for pushovers.
[02:50:46.298 --> 02:50:57.065]  And once they find out that you're not a pushover because you have somebody in your corner that knows what they're talking about or willing to assert your rights, it's easier for them to move on to the next target at this point.
[02:50:57.225 --> 02:51:00.967]  And again, we're promoting this to hard-working blue-collar folks to salt the earth.
[02:51:00.967 --> 02:51:08.251]  What you guys' real specialty is cryptocurrency, middle-class folks, rich people, and that's your main business, is all sorts of tax preparing.
[02:51:08.251 --> 02:51:11.613]  And the stuff you advise us on, I went and had third parties check it, they said it's dead on.
[02:51:12.293 --> 02:51:21.118]  Well, so the thing is, is the regime is, you know, in this bureaucratic nightmare where they have these things that they wanted the IRS to do.
[02:51:21.118 --> 02:51:27.301]  The hiring of agents, the taxing of $600 on Zelle and all that stuff, right?
[02:51:28.001 --> 02:51:29.802]  They want to kill the underground economy.
[02:51:29.802 --> 02:51:30.462]  Exactly.
[02:51:30.462 --> 02:51:46.669]  But here's the situation is, the Biden administration came at the IRS so full force with that, that the day before Christmas yesterday, the IRS said, we just do not have the ability to make these changes this year.
[02:51:46.669 --> 02:51:47.250]  I saw that.
[02:51:47.250 --> 02:51:49.511]  Even the IRS said, whoa, don't have us do this.
[02:51:50.411 --> 02:52:05.695]  So when even the IRS, who has just given a bunch of money and new agents, is saying, listen, we don't still have the resources or manpower to deal with these new tax laws because they would create so many more audits and so much more work.
[02:52:05.695 --> 02:52:08.256]  And again, the lockdowns, they admit, were meant to destroy small business.
[02:52:08.256 --> 02:52:09.976]  They know everybody's reorganizing now.
[02:52:09.976 --> 02:52:11.417]  They want to come back with a double hit.
[02:52:12.037 --> 02:52:23.127]  That's exactly right, and that's why the IRS has made more money last year and in 22 than ever before, because they knocked out all those small businesses and the people working for them had to get 1099 jobs.
[02:52:23.127 --> 02:52:30.053]  I want to get into what the IRS is doing, what you think Congress should do, and we start the next hour, but talk about the services right now at jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:52:30.053 --> 02:52:33.376]  It takes you right to their main website, but then that way they know it's a sponsorship.
[02:52:33.376 --> 02:52:35.298]  We get the support, so it's a win-win.
[02:52:35.298 --> 02:52:36.258]  Everybody should be doing this.
[02:52:36.258 --> 02:52:37.079]  You should get a review.
[02:52:37.079 --> 02:52:38.120]  It's so important.
[02:52:38.120 --> 02:52:39.101]  What are the services you offer?
[02:52:39.361 --> 02:52:43.182]  Okay, so as I was mentioning previously, audit protection.
[02:52:43.182 --> 02:52:54.646]  This means for three years, we're going to review your transcripts on a monthly basis, monitor any IRS notices you receive, and prevent audits by tracking your IRS file and see if anything's flagged.
[02:52:54.646 --> 02:52:56.066]  So you have the file directed to you?
[02:52:56.066 --> 02:52:56.586]  Correct.
[02:52:56.586 --> 02:53:02.088]  Once we get a power of attorney on file, then the IRS will contact us before they contact the taxpayer.
[02:53:02.088 --> 02:53:04.849]  And then right away when it's a big law firm, they go, ooh!
[02:53:04.849 --> 02:53:05.549]  Exactly.
[02:53:05.549 --> 02:53:07.810]  So then they know that... They just move on to the next victim.
[02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:09.732]  In most cases, yes.
[02:53:09.732 --> 02:53:11.656]  No, you've got to fight some fights.
[02:53:11.656 --> 02:53:12.819]  Right, exactly.
[02:53:12.819 --> 02:53:17.768]  Do you have a ratio of if you're not represented and how much they come after you versus if you do?
[02:53:18.556 --> 02:53:32.965]  What I can tell you is if you're not represented and they come after you, there is virtually a 0% chance of getting any equity out of that scenario, because you're dealing with someone under the color of the U.S.
[02:53:32.965 --> 02:53:41.009]  government, and believe me, they will use the color of their title to scare you into thinking that that is the only way out of the situation.
[02:53:41.009 --> 02:53:43.631]  And explain, color of law means it looks like it's law, but it's not.
[02:53:44.031 --> 02:53:58.141]  The color of law means because the person speaking to you is an IRS agent, you believe that they know everything that they're saying legally is correct and they have the law on their side to do what they're trying to do to you.
[02:53:58.141 --> 02:53:59.642]  But that is not the case.
[02:53:59.642 --> 02:54:13.272]  The IRS agents that do audits on people in the small business sector, they are merely clerks that work for the IRS and they use a guideline called the Internal Revenue Manual, which many of them misinterpret
[02:54:13.812 --> 02:54:14.333]  Every day.
[02:54:14.333 --> 02:54:14.533]  Sure.
[02:54:14.533 --> 02:54:22.518]  What do you make of all these videos that we've played before you got here and weeks before where they're like training thousands of agents with guns that look like they can't even find which end it is.
[02:54:22.518 --> 02:54:28.702]  They're like, we're going to get the person with a daycare and the person that cleans cars and the person that mows lawns.
[02:54:28.702 --> 02:54:30.564]  And they're like, yeah, I mean, what?
[02:54:30.564 --> 02:54:32.145]  That is so bizarre.
[02:54:32.145 --> 02:54:34.546]  It's the militarization of the IRS.
[02:54:34.546 --> 02:54:39.350]  And we've seen it in the last year where last year they bought four million rounds of ammunition.
[02:54:39.350 --> 02:54:40.991]  They bought all these guns.
[02:54:40.991 --> 02:54:42.972]  And this year now they have created a
[02:54:43.092 --> 02:54:43.673]  I think so.
[02:55:05.452 --> 02:55:08.413]  And they're targeting a group that pays almost none of the taxes.
[02:55:08.413 --> 02:55:19.097]  It is easy for them to go after the lower and middle classes because the lack of education that is traditional between the class system in the United States.
[02:55:19.097 --> 02:55:19.918]  And so they will use that.
[02:55:19.918 --> 02:55:26.000]  And we're not being mean, it's just that wealthy people and middle class people gain the tax codes that's written for them.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.221]  We're just saying learn how to do that legally.
[02:55:28.221 --> 02:55:30.222]  So rattle through it in the last three minutes to break.
[02:55:30.842 --> 02:55:36.347]  One of the great services you have for people worth $100 million, $100,000, people that are in debt.
[02:55:36.347 --> 02:55:37.749]  I mean, you have services for everything.
[02:55:37.749 --> 02:55:39.130]  You've got the blueprint.
[02:55:39.130 --> 02:55:40.911]  You just give folks the tricks to it.
[02:55:40.911 --> 02:55:41.832]  Correct, Alex.
[02:55:41.832 --> 02:55:43.474]  And there's three categories here.
[02:55:43.474 --> 02:55:44.555]  There is the present.
[02:55:44.555 --> 02:55:45.336]  That's this year.
[02:55:45.336 --> 02:55:46.457]  That's this year's filing.
[02:55:46.457 --> 02:55:47.898]  Everyone needs to file their taxes this year.
[02:55:47.998 --> 02:55:49.159]  What's your average settlement, Dalbeck?
[02:55:49.159 --> 02:55:50.840]  I've seen some of the numbers, it's pretty amazing.
[02:56:14.353 --> 02:56:23.719]  So, it's different for every person, but we can get a lot of them down to 10 or 15 percent, provided that the economics are there.
[02:56:23.719 --> 02:56:30.703]  If you're the type of person that is making a million dollars a year and you owe $20,000, I'm not going to be able to lower your tax debt to 10 percent of that.
[02:56:30.703 --> 02:56:32.624]  But most people are not in that situation.
[02:56:32.624 --> 02:56:33.865]  It's the other way around.
[02:56:33.865 --> 02:56:39.408]  They owe a fat tax debt, and there's no way they're going to be able to pay it off in a reasonable amount of time.
[02:56:39.408 --> 02:56:43.751]  When that is the case, it is your right as a taxpayer to get a settlement from the
[02:56:43.831 --> 02:56:43.931]  Yeah.
[02:56:43.931 --> 02:56:47.054]  But if you don't know to settle, it'll just rack up and then they'll come arrest you.
[02:56:47.054 --> 02:56:47.574]  Oh, correct.
[02:56:47.574 --> 02:56:50.397]  Because they are not going to tell you you have the right to settle.
[02:56:50.397 --> 02:56:54.600]  They're going to want you to just keep paying those bills as a rack up penalties and interest.
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:56.902]  Eventually, you won't even be paying your taxes anymore.
[02:56:56.902 --> 02:57:01.607]  You're just paying the interest and penalties on top of it as the debt accrues and accrues and accrues.
[02:57:01.607 --> 02:57:03.528]  And that's what we prevent.
[02:57:03.528 --> 02:57:06.050]  And we'll settle that so that doesn't happen.
[02:57:06.050 --> 02:57:07.572]  Now, if you are making money,
[02:57:08.152 --> 02:57:22.415]  In the future, and you want to pay less in taxes, you may not have your entity structuring in the most beneficial way, using corporations and flow-through entities, so that you pay the least amount of taxes legally possible.
[02:57:22.415 --> 02:57:25.036]  C-corporations pay the lowest tax rate in this country.
[02:57:25.036 --> 02:57:29.857]  It's a flat tax of 21%, whether you made $10 or $10 million.
[02:57:29.857 --> 02:57:32.558]  And again, folks, this is the secret knowledge I want you to know.
[02:57:32.558 --> 02:57:34.058]  A lot of my listeners are like, screw you.
[02:57:34.838 --> 02:57:37.279]  I'm living out here in a cabin in the middle of nowhere.
[02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:39.340]  Hey, I wish I was with you.
[02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.241]  Do what you want.
[02:57:40.241 --> 02:57:43.662]  I'm just saying, if you want to be in the system, you might as well know the rules of it.
[02:57:43.662 --> 02:57:49.205]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:49.205 --> 02:57:52.347]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:57:52.347 --> 02:57:54.668]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:57:54.668 --> 02:57:58.590]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:57:58.590 --> 02:58:02.532]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:58:03.968 --> 02:58:07.511]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:58:07.511 --> 02:58:16.338]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:58:16.338 --> 02:58:19.981]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:58:19.981 --> 02:58:24.905]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:58:25.746 --> 02:58:26.707]  I know you spread the word.
[02:58:26.707 --> 02:58:28.208]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:58:28.208 --> 02:58:28.789]  Keep doing it.
[02:58:28.789 --> 02:58:37.717]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[02:58:37.717 --> 02:58:42.041]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:42.041 --> 02:58:46.985]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:58:46.985 --> 02:58:47.766]  Please take action now.
[02:58:48.346 --> 02:58:57.753]  Introducing InfoWars super high-end supplement line at up to 50% off what these same formulas are sold for in stores.

[02:59:41.198 --> 02:59:44.079]  This is our new InfoWars MD Incredible line.
[02:59:51.308 --> 02:59:55.213]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:09.515 --> 03:00:18.017]  And again, I want to explain this a thousand times to a lot of our listeners who are super smart and know the Federal Reserve's a scam and the 16th Amendment and all of it.
[03:00:18.017 --> 03:00:19.698]  I know all that.
[03:00:19.698 --> 03:00:25.819]  We're simply talking about, you can either be a globalist that pays no taxes, and I mean, I don't even know any of those people.
[03:00:25.819 --> 03:00:28.480]  I've met with a few of them, but they're my enemy.
[03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:30.701]  Like one out of like 500 million people is one of those people.
[03:00:32.970 --> 03:00:39.115]  Or you're the general public that's trying to operate the system, but they wrote that for their own minions to get out of it.
[03:00:39.115 --> 03:00:41.337]  Or you go totally rogue, and that's your decision to make.
[03:00:41.337 --> 03:00:42.458]  I'm not putting people down.
[03:00:42.458 --> 03:00:48.223]  I kind of admire the outlaws, because, you know, when the government's criminal, it makes all the patriots criminals.
[03:00:48.223 --> 03:00:48.903]  I mean, I get that.
[03:00:48.903 --> 03:00:50.304]  I'm not judging you.
[03:00:50.304 --> 03:00:51.625]  I'm not saying you're wrong.
[03:00:51.625 --> 03:00:55.809]  I'm saying, I couldn't run this operation, have all this crew, and do all this, and then not
[03:00:57.602 --> 03:01:02.789]  It's the one area I guess I compromise in and I guess in a way sell out because they'll just shut us down.
[03:01:02.789 --> 03:01:09.918]  So you have to play in their sick system and I'm trying to reform it, I'm trying to repeal it, I'm trying to fix it, but I can't live under a rock.
[03:01:09.918 --> 03:01:12.362]  For those of you that can live off the radar, more power to you.
[03:01:12.702 --> 03:01:14.103]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[03:01:14.103 --> 03:01:19.265]  And if you can and do live off the radar, then there's not really much they can do.
[03:01:19.265 --> 03:01:33.631]  But the thing is, if you want to exist in American society, have a business, have credit, have a bank account, that you don't have to worry about the state or the IRS attacking, you are going to have to play in their rules.
[03:01:33.631 --> 03:01:37.672]  Because the only way to avoid them is to go completely under that rule.
[03:01:37.672 --> 03:01:39.313]  And they wrote escape hatches for themselves.
[03:01:39.733 --> 03:01:40.913]  They definitely did.
[03:01:40.913 --> 03:01:45.475]  And so here's the thing is, like you said, there are two systems, right?
[03:01:45.475 --> 03:01:46.515]  There's the elitist system.
[03:01:46.515 --> 03:01:47.816]  We're not part of that system.
[03:01:47.816 --> 03:01:51.777]  And then there is the taxpayer system that we're all a part of.
[03:01:51.777 --> 03:02:08.123]  Yes, you could choose to live under a rock and not pay any taxes, but then that severely limits your potential to earn additional income, hire employees, and do other things in American society that anyone else who is paying taxes can do.
[03:02:08.963 --> 03:02:12.564]  More power to the Amish, more power to the Patriots, more power to veterans that go out of nowhere?
[03:02:12.564 --> 03:02:13.525]  I wish I could do that.
[03:02:13.525 --> 03:02:16.886]  But for those of us that are still in the system, this is the mitigating effect.
[03:02:16.886 --> 03:02:18.487]  It's up to 90% mitigation.
[03:02:18.487 --> 03:02:19.187]  That's right, Alex.
[03:02:19.187 --> 03:02:28.850]  And remember, yes, it is the law that we have to pay our taxes, but our Taxpayer Bill of Rights says we only have to pay the amount of tax that's actually due.
[03:02:28.850 --> 03:02:36.193]  Now that sounds simple, but what that really means is with all the deductions and all the credits and all the loopholes in the tax code,
[03:02:36.573 --> 03:02:39.356]  We get to legally use all of them to pay the least amount of money.
[03:02:39.356 --> 03:02:43.660]  And again, that's why they wrote it for themselves, because they love to screw us, and not themselves.
[03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:44.821]  So you just use their tricks.
[03:02:44.821 --> 03:02:46.622]  That's why this is so important.
[03:02:46.622 --> 03:02:48.064]  I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[03:02:49.448 --> 03:02:50.129]  That's right.
[03:02:50.129 --> 03:02:59.016]  And so we use the tricks that the loopholes that were written for large corporations and, you know, multi-million dollar organizations.
[03:02:59.016 --> 03:02:59.536]  But guess what?
[03:02:59.536 --> 03:03:02.418]  The law is the same and we can use it.
[03:03:02.418 --> 03:03:08.363]  The corporate rules, corporate shareholder notes, trusts, all these things can be used at any level.
[03:03:08.363 --> 03:03:10.184]  As I was saying before, it's
[03:03:10.945 --> 03:03:15.851]  The lack of knowledge that everybody has, and they did this to us on purpose.
[03:03:15.851 --> 03:03:20.576]  They made financial literacy very hard because they can control us easier that way.
[03:03:20.576 --> 03:03:25.141]  When you understand that, you can exist in the system and not be controlled.
[03:03:25.141 --> 03:03:26.443]  You don't have to live under a rock.
[03:03:27.776 --> 03:03:28.756]  We're going to go to break in a minute.
[03:03:28.756 --> 03:03:29.757]  Some stations join us.
[03:03:29.757 --> 03:03:36.259]  And again, I'm not criticizing our listeners that have been successful enough to know how to create a barter economy.
[03:03:36.259 --> 03:03:38.860]  I think that's the future if we don't stop this tyranny.
[03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:44.963]  And that's, I think you have a hybrid where we're like, you know, one spouse is over here in the system, the other spouse is barter.
[03:03:44.963 --> 03:03:47.364]  I mean, the point is that there's just systems.
[03:03:47.364 --> 03:03:49.285]  We're saying, what system are you in?
[03:03:49.285 --> 03:03:49.625]  Correct.
[03:03:50.345 --> 03:03:50.765]  Correct.
[03:03:50.765 --> 03:03:55.667]  And if you don't want to be part of the system, that's always been a possibility.
[03:03:55.667 --> 03:03:58.807]  But if you want to be part of the system, we do have to play by their rules.
[03:03:58.807 --> 03:04:00.128]  Well, the Native Americans tried to do that.
[03:04:00.128 --> 03:04:01.788]  You saw what happened.
[03:04:01.788 --> 03:04:02.749]  That's one example.
[03:04:02.749 --> 03:04:10.591]  There's been many people who have tried to do it, and the government repeatedly slams them down, as they do with these tax protesters, is what they call them.
[03:04:10.591 --> 03:04:13.812]  Instead, use their tricks, their escape actions, against them.
[03:04:14.412 --> 03:04:18.016]  Right, because... And that's why you say they change it every two years, because they want to keep screwing us.
[03:04:18.016 --> 03:04:27.105]  If they change it every two years, it becomes very hard for the regular person to keep up to date on the small, minute changes that really are substantial when you think about it.
[03:04:27.105 --> 03:04:34.112]  And, of course, the only way to be kept abreast of this is to either study it yourself or have someone in your corner that does that.
[03:04:34.112 --> 03:04:34.653]  Now let's explain.
[03:04:34.653 --> 03:04:36.174]  There's a lot of lay people that are great at this.
[03:04:36.755 --> 03:04:41.521]  But when you've got a big tax firm for almost nothing doing it for you, you're standing behind them.
[03:04:41.521 --> 03:04:43.403]  That's our bread and butter, and we stand behind you 100%.
[03:04:43.403 --> 03:04:47.409]  And then the big guys go, oh, that's a hardened target.
[03:04:47.409 --> 03:04:49.071]  I'm going to move on to an easier target.
[03:04:49.071 --> 03:04:51.294]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with Tyler Bennett.
[03:04:51.294 --> 03:04:53.276]  Go to jonestaxrelief.com.
[03:04:53.276 --> 03:04:54.157]  jonestaxrelief.com.
[03:04:58.223 --> 03:05:10.895]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:05:10.895 --> 03:05:14.077]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:05:14.858 --> 03:05:17.160]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:24.747]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[03:05:24.747 --> 03:05:33.575]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:05:33.575 --> 03:05:39.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:41.702]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:05:41.702 --> 03:05:48.968]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:05:48.968 --> 03:05:50.369]  It is all in your hands.
[03:05:50.369 --> 03:05:51.710]  So thanks for your support.
[03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:52.931]  Stand up against the globalists.
[03:05:52.931 --> 03:05:56.193]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:05:56.193 --> 03:05:56.694]  It's up to you.
[03:06:08.174 --> 03:06:10.035]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:10.035 --> 03:06:19.902]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:40.069 --> 03:06:43.011]  Well, the globalists are breaking God's laws big time.
[03:06:43.011 --> 03:06:45.013]  Tyler Bennett is a really smart tax attorney.
[03:06:45.013 --> 03:06:48.596]  He has hundreds of attorneys and CPAs with this great organization.
[03:06:48.596 --> 03:06:52.339]  You find the organization and support the broadcast by going to jonestaxrelief.com or 800-869-0723.
[03:06:52.339 --> 03:06:54.161]  This is the type of sponsor that I only feel good about.
[03:07:03.556 --> 03:07:12.140]  If you're wanting to go the route of UCC filings and Federal Reserve bonds and New World Order and you owe nothing, hey, that's your thing.
[03:07:12.140 --> 03:07:13.561]  That's not what this is.
[03:07:13.561 --> 03:07:20.884]  This is using the IRS system of the elite's right for themselves to get out of up to 90% of these fraudulent garbage taxes.
[03:07:20.884 --> 03:07:21.564]  That's this.
[03:07:21.564 --> 03:07:27.407]  So again, if you're the one-tenth of 1% of the New World Order like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates that pay no taxes and Google on record,
[03:07:28.308 --> 03:07:28.908]  I'm not in that group.
[03:07:45.595 --> 03:07:46.275]  They're scared of that.
[03:07:46.275 --> 03:07:48.356]  I think that's really the future is that.
[03:07:48.356 --> 03:07:51.157]  But that takes a lot of infrastructure, a lot of know-how.
[03:07:51.157 --> 03:07:52.398]  We've already lost much of it.
[03:07:52.398 --> 03:07:53.878]  I just hope we get it back going.
[03:07:53.878 --> 03:07:57.300]  But when you talk about the services you offer, lay this out.
[03:07:57.300 --> 03:08:00.761]  Just a bunch of examples of how easy this is, because most people don't get it.
[03:08:02.443 --> 03:08:08.769]  It could be incredibly easy, but it's one of those things that you wouldn't know about unless somebody told you.
[03:08:08.769 --> 03:08:13.873]  For example, if you're making over $150,000 or $200,000 a year as an individual, you're already getting taxed too much.
[03:08:13.873 --> 03:08:15.334]  We could put you in a proper entity setup.
[03:08:21.019 --> 03:08:29.643]  And make sure you're paying the corporate tax rate as opposed to the entire individual tax rate up to 37%, which you would as an individual.
[03:08:29.643 --> 03:08:35.085]  And see, another thing is the administration will use facts to try to trick you.
[03:08:35.085 --> 03:08:39.567]  For example, Biden was talking about an unrealized capital gains tax, right?
[03:08:39.567 --> 03:08:42.448]  That's one of those things that before you think about it could sound
[03:08:42.788 --> 03:08:44.449]  Oh, that's a good way to tax the billionaires.
[03:08:44.449 --> 03:08:50.672]  The problem is that's going to hit everyone else, too, that holds stocks disproportionately, right?
[03:08:50.672 --> 03:09:00.896]  And so we can't have a major change, an overhaul of the tax system to that extent that it affects the middle and lower classes disproportionately.
[03:09:00.896 --> 03:09:03.417]  Well, of course, that's what the regime wants to do.
[03:09:03.417 --> 03:09:04.778]  And so we're here to protect you.
[03:09:05.578 --> 03:09:10.040]  Against any of those audits that they have pledged to do this year.
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:16.722]  And if you're making money, give me a call so we can make sure you're not overpaying in taxes, because that's your right.
[03:09:16.722 --> 03:09:20.103]  And every dollar you overpay, we know what they're sending it to.
[03:09:20.103 --> 03:09:25.204]  You see all these... What I like is, I've seen your operation, I know what you do, I've used you guys.
[03:09:25.204 --> 03:09:28.506]  You don't sit there and rope a dope and go forever with people and do all this stuff.
[03:09:28.506 --> 03:09:31.467]  You just cut right to the tax returns and say boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:09:34.652 --> 03:09:49.085]  That is how the system works because once we see what your tax situation is next, or last year, it's very obvious what the solution is going forward.
[03:09:49.085 --> 03:09:59.473]  Now, not to put anybody down, but a lot of tax professionals are risk adverse, meaning they will say whatever the IRS says,
[03:10:00.154 --> 03:10:02.656]  Before they question any kind of relationship.
[03:10:02.656 --> 03:10:03.357]  Well, that's what I was told.
[03:10:03.357 --> 03:10:05.859]  I've been with big CPAs and said, hey, we're supposed to get these write-offs.
[03:10:05.859 --> 03:10:07.741]  They go, well, that'll make you audited.
[03:10:07.741 --> 03:10:10.063]  And I'm like, but they're write-offs and we're not lying.
[03:10:10.063 --> 03:10:11.945]  Well, we're not going to do those write-offs.
[03:10:11.945 --> 03:10:13.727]  Correct.
[03:10:13.727 --> 03:10:19.011]  Most CPAs are very risk adverse, meaning that they do not want to get their client audited.
[03:10:19.011 --> 03:10:19.592]  When did that change?
[03:10:19.592 --> 03:10:21.614]  Like 15 years ago, they made it where they were liable, right?
[03:10:21.954 --> 03:10:22.754]  Yes.
[03:10:22.754 --> 03:10:22.954]  Right.
[03:10:22.954 --> 03:10:24.355]  So they sign the return.
[03:10:24.355 --> 03:10:27.136]  Now they're liable if the client gets audited.
[03:10:27.136 --> 03:10:32.157]  But see, that really only matters if the firm you're working with is scared of getting audited.
[03:10:32.157 --> 03:10:39.039]  We are not scared of getting audited because we know we're not doing anything in the gray area or illegal.
[03:10:39.039 --> 03:10:42.200]  We are doing by the book to save you.
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:43.680]  And they know when they've got a bulldog.
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:45.961]  You're not bragging, but they just most of the time move on.
[03:10:46.892 --> 03:10:55.489]  Exactly, because like I said, they're bullies, and as soon as they figure out that you're not the kid that's gonna cry, but you're gonna stand up for your lunch money, they'll move on to the next person.
[03:10:56.616 --> 03:10:57.637]  And that's really how it is.
[03:10:57.637 --> 03:11:09.785]  So when we're in your corner, if they come and knock on your door or send you a letter and say, we're going to assess you, we're going to audit you, we think you made... You just say, we're going to handle that now.
[03:11:09.785 --> 03:11:13.008]  And now they know they're talking to lawyers and CPAs and they don't bullshit us for it.
[03:11:13.008 --> 03:11:17.331]  They can direct their calls to us, do not bother our client, and we will handle it.
[03:11:17.331 --> 03:11:18.312]  Absolutely.
[03:11:18.312 --> 03:11:19.673]  And nine times out of ten they just move on.
[03:11:20.575 --> 03:11:26.936]  Most times they're going to move on, or we're going to come away with a walk-away settlement.
[03:11:26.936 --> 03:11:30.017]  Because it's just not worth it for them to pursue.
[03:11:30.017 --> 03:11:31.437]  Because they know you're going to litigate.
[03:11:31.437 --> 03:11:33.097]  We cut to brass tacks here.
[03:11:33.097 --> 03:11:33.798]  Exactly.
[03:11:33.798 --> 03:11:36.598]  And we will... Yes, sir, because the people owe a bunch, and we know it's a fraud, folks.
[03:11:36.598 --> 03:11:38.999]  My point is, if you owe a bunch, great.
[03:11:38.999 --> 03:11:42.759]  Dial it back instead of these endless wars that I've seen destroy so many people.
[03:11:42.759 --> 03:11:45.700]  And I'm not saying, if you choose your battle to fight the IRS forever,
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:50.625]  I mean, I got pissed at the government when I was a little kid because my dad owned a couple dental offices in Dallas.
[03:11:50.625 --> 03:11:52.086]  He paid all the taxes.
[03:11:52.086 --> 03:11:54.368]  They changed the tax law in the late 80s.
[03:11:54.368 --> 03:11:58.052]  And the tax lady told my dad, she said, Mr. Jones, we're white-collar criminals.
[03:11:58.052 --> 03:11:59.213]  We're going to shake you down.
[03:11:59.213 --> 03:11:59.694]  Just pass.
[03:11:59.694 --> 03:12:02.557]  And he fought him forever and did it all and ended up beating him.
[03:12:02.557 --> 03:12:04.038]  But it was like five years of hell.
[03:12:04.779 --> 03:12:09.502]  And, but he later told me, my God, once he finally got the right tax lawyer, it ended it all.
[03:12:09.502 --> 03:12:11.483]  It was just, he just wish he knew all that.
[03:12:11.483 --> 03:12:22.650]  Because there are these arguments that are made, sovereign citizenship, invalid, invalidity of the 16th Amendment, et cetera, et cetera, that people do put forth to try to.
[03:12:22.650 --> 03:12:23.691]  And that's true.
[03:12:23.691 --> 03:12:25.752]  The Supreme Court said black people are two thirds human.
[03:12:25.752 --> 03:12:26.953]  Later, they had to reverse it.
[03:12:26.953 --> 03:12:29.975]  But when those laws are standing, it hasn't been overturned.
[03:12:29.975 --> 03:12:30.836]  Yes, it's a fraud.
[03:12:30.836 --> 03:12:33.137]  We know that, but they're not still going to come after you.
[03:12:33.217 --> 03:12:37.100]  But it is still the law of the land, and we're fighting against City Hall.
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:40.223]  So we just have to realize that they have all the power.
[03:12:40.223 --> 03:12:45.988]  They love going after patriots that think they've got magic dust, and there's so many cons out there lying to them.
[03:12:45.988 --> 03:12:47.930]  So yeah, the system's illegitimate, we get that.
[03:12:47.930 --> 03:12:51.353]  But there's so many cons telling people they've got a magic bullet for them.
[03:12:51.753 --> 03:12:52.473]  Absolutely right.
[03:12:52.473 --> 03:12:54.194]  And I do think that's an important point.
[03:12:54.194 --> 03:12:56.194]  People get hurt sometimes in these situations.
[03:12:56.194 --> 03:12:58.955]  More power to it to those people living under a rock.
[03:13:10.598 --> 03:13:18.202]  You know, for the people that try to do it, and make an assertion to the IRS that is illegal, and they did not know that, they go to jail.
[03:13:18.202 --> 03:13:25.066]  And so, you don't want to go to jail, you don't want to make an illegal assertion to the IRS, which they've already adjudicated, by the way.
[03:13:25.066 --> 03:13:28.328]  Anything that you think is a new argument, they've already heard.
[03:13:28.328 --> 03:13:31.190]  Or, they will be able to group it into something.
[03:13:31.190 --> 03:13:35.192]  And they've already got kept federal juries ready to send your ass to prison for 10 years.
[03:13:35.192 --> 03:13:38.654]  That's correct, because when you go to town... 95% conviction rate.
[03:13:38.834 --> 03:13:44.281]  When you go to tax court, not only is the federal judge with a 95% conviction rate, but they work for the IRS.
[03:13:44.281 --> 03:13:48.065]  They don't have your, um, they're not thinking about your skin at all.
[03:13:48.065 --> 03:13:55.534]  And it's disgusting, and it should be abolished, and it's wrong, and we're supporting that, and we're pushing that, but let's not start smoking dope here.
[03:13:56.115 --> 03:14:00.098]  McCarthy and the Republicans passed this law to abolish the new 87,000.
[03:14:00.098 --> 03:14:01.580]  That ain't passing the Senate.
[03:14:01.580 --> 03:14:03.141]  Stop believing the lies.
[03:14:03.141 --> 03:14:04.282]  It's not going to pass the Senate.
[03:14:04.282 --> 03:14:07.205]  And Biden said that he personally will not sign it.
[03:14:07.205 --> 03:14:07.825]  So there you go.
[03:14:07.825 --> 03:14:08.906]  It's dead in the water.
[03:14:08.906 --> 03:14:09.507]  McCarthy.
[03:14:09.507 --> 03:14:10.808]  And we wish it wasn't.
[03:14:10.808 --> 03:14:12.809]  But let's not lie to each other.
[03:14:12.809 --> 03:14:13.590]  Right.
[03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:14.591]  No more, folks.
[03:14:14.591 --> 03:14:18.754]  Even McCarthy yesterday said he agreed to get it this far.
[03:14:18.754 --> 03:14:20.616]  And now even he's walking back.
[03:14:20.616 --> 03:14:22.217]  Well, yeah, some listeners will be like Jones.
[03:14:22.938 --> 03:14:30.887]  Why don't you support, I do support abolishing it, but I'm not going to steer our listeners into being destroyed.
[03:14:30.887 --> 03:14:31.147]  Right.
[03:14:31.147 --> 03:14:38.395]  I mean, if people could do it more power to, I'm just saying, pay all their astronomical numbers or at least look at mitigation.
[03:14:39.286 --> 03:14:40.146]  Correct.
[03:14:40.146 --> 03:14:46.410]  You know, because you can either pay everything, you can pay what you actually owe, or you can try to pay nothing.
[03:14:46.410 --> 03:14:50.912]  And that's just a game that eventually you're going to have to pay the piper.
[03:14:50.912 --> 03:14:52.333]  So the name of the game... Well, exactly.
[03:14:52.333 --> 03:14:55.234]  If you're making $50,000 a year and want to hide somewhere, you can get away with it.
[03:14:55.234 --> 03:14:56.175]  More power to you.
[03:14:56.175 --> 03:14:58.836]  But if you've got employees and you're making a couple hundred, they're going to get you.
[03:14:59.136 --> 03:15:00.796]  That's where they're going to get these people.
[03:15:00.796 --> 03:15:13.859]  It's small business owners and people who have employees, people who have a store, people that have a footprint, okay, that can't hide under a rock, that need banking, that need processing to make money for their businesses.
[03:15:13.859 --> 03:15:15.840]  These are the people that cannot live under a rock.
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:20.121]  And that's all Biden's announcing is they already have AI NSA surveillance of it.
[03:15:20.121 --> 03:15:21.321]  They're just announcing it now.
[03:15:21.781 --> 03:15:22.401]  Correct.
[03:15:22.401 --> 03:15:33.325]  And, oh, here's the thing, is also with that TIGDA audit of the IRS, they found that this AI that is being used to... Hold on, stay there, and I'm going to explain to the listeners.
[03:15:33.325 --> 03:15:34.785]  Do what you want.
[03:15:34.785 --> 03:15:38.786]  My job is literally to pray about it and try to give you the right answer.
[03:15:38.786 --> 03:15:40.667]  Hey, you can live out on a farm with Amish.
[03:15:40.667 --> 03:15:41.587]  I may go do that myself.
[03:15:41.587 --> 03:15:44.108]  I mean, I admire you.
[03:15:44.108 --> 03:15:48.109]  I'm just saying, all this stuff of hiding from them is over.
[03:15:48.109 --> 03:15:49.950]  The social credit score is here with AI.
[03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:51.150]  Let's play it when we come back.
[03:15:57.116 --> 03:15:59.357]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:15:59.357 --> 03:16:03.379]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[03:16:03.379 --> 03:16:04.680]  There's a solution.
[03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:05.680]  The Wellness Company.
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:08.982]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:16:08.982 --> 03:16:16.185]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[03:16:16.445 --> 03:16:42.527]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[03:16:43.524 --> 03:16:43.744]  Thank you.
[03:16:56.866 --> 03:16:59.908]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[03:16:59.908 --> 03:17:08.253]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:17:08.253 --> 03:17:17.818]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[03:17:17.818 --> 03:17:23.281]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[03:17:23.281 --> 03:17:25.983]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[03:17:26.223 --> 03:17:28.644]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[03:17:28.644 --> 03:17:33.826]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[03:17:33.826 --> 03:17:36.207]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram.
[03:17:36.207 --> 03:17:39.968]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[03:17:39.968 --> 03:17:42.629]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[03:17:42.629 --> 03:17:48.731]  These similar formulas, or the same formulas, sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[03:17:48.731 --> 03:17:53.793]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com, a true 360 win.
[03:17:56.644 --> 03:18:09.322]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:18:09.322 --> 03:18:12.507]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:18:13.288 --> 03:18:15.589]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[03:18:15.589 --> 03:18:23.152]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[03:18:23.152 --> 03:18:31.515]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:18:31.515 --> 03:18:37.678]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:18:38.178 --> 03:18:40.120]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:47.386]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:18:47.386 --> 03:18:48.807]  It is all in your hands.
[03:18:48.807 --> 03:18:50.149]  So thanks for your support.
[03:18:50.149 --> 03:18:51.350]  Stand up against the globalists.
[03:18:51.350 --> 03:18:54.612]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:18:54.612 --> 03:18:55.113]  It's up to you.
[03:18:56.610 --> 03:18:58.432]  Infowars is winning.
[03:18:58.432 --> 03:19:00.474]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[03:19:00.474 --> 03:19:03.257]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[03:19:03.257 --> 03:19:06.020]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[03:19:06.020 --> 03:19:08.122]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[03:19:08.122 --> 03:19:10.184]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[03:19:10.184 --> 03:19:11.145]  None of that's true.
[03:19:11.145 --> 03:19:12.046]  It's all being appealed.
[03:19:12.506 --> 03:19:14.627]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[03:19:14.627 --> 03:19:21.488]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[03:19:21.488 --> 03:19:24.929]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[03:19:24.929 --> 03:19:27.630]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[03:19:27.630 --> 03:19:37.512]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[03:19:37.972 --> 03:19:39.333]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:19:39.333 --> 03:19:43.157]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[03:19:43.157 --> 03:19:47.841]  Because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:19:47.841 --> 03:19:51.224]  The majority of you have not been silenced, but some of you have.
[03:19:51.224 --> 03:19:53.005]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[03:19:53.005 --> 03:19:59.051]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[03:19:59.051 --> 03:20:04.956]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:19.036 --> 03:20:19.577]  We're good to go.
[03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:43.362]  Because they're big corporations that are literally paid to lie to you.
[03:20:43.362 --> 03:20:46.745]  But they've written loopholes for everybody, so there's a third way.
[03:20:46.745 --> 03:20:47.625]  Leave the system?
[03:20:47.625 --> 03:20:48.506]  Great.
[03:20:48.506 --> 03:20:51.728]  Or become a globalist and have $100 billion, you don't pay taxes.
[03:20:51.728 --> 03:20:52.889]  None of us are that.
[03:20:52.889 --> 03:20:53.910]  So this is the way to go.
[03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:56.372]  Tell them about your services and other key points you want to add.
[03:20:57.349 --> 03:21:07.137]  Well, as I was saying before the last break, the IRS has this new AI that they're using to, you know, get what they call tax cheats, okay?
[03:21:07.137 --> 03:21:14.262]  But what was also found out in the TIGDA audit is this software, this credit, this social credit... Well, they call it AI.
[03:21:14.262 --> 03:21:17.404]  It's hooked into all you're doing to track you.
[03:21:17.404 --> 03:21:19.866]  Yeah, it's a social credit score like it's in China.
[03:21:19.866 --> 03:21:21.648]  They just don't call it that yet because that's not...
[03:21:22.148 --> 03:21:23.710]  Politically cool over here.
[03:21:23.710 --> 03:21:25.031]  But that's what it is.
[03:21:25.031 --> 03:21:40.026]  And the problem that TIGDA, again, the organization that audits the IRS, found out, is just like the $600 Venmo thing, the IRS was not ready to implement this, even though... For folks who don't know, they're going to trap people making $600 a year, and this is crazy.
[03:21:42.248 --> 03:21:42.909]  Correct.
[03:21:42.909 --> 03:21:56.826]  And they had to delay that a year because the IRS literally did not have enough manpower or systems in place to change the law as fast as not-so-sleepy... So they're coming and you're the cavalry?
[03:21:56.826 --> 03:21:57.787]  That is correct.
[03:21:57.787 --> 03:21:58.688]  So with this AI...
[03:21:59.389 --> 03:21:59.729]  And here's
[03:22:29.309 --> 03:22:29.870]  No.
[03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:30.951]  Absolutely.
[03:22:30.951 --> 03:22:38.077]  First of, like I said before, the audit protection, if we need to do that, it doesn't matter if you get audited, you're protected.
[03:22:38.077 --> 03:22:49.768]  But, if you want to come to us and say, hey, what can I do to change the situation so that if and when I do get audited, there's nothing there, they'll look at my account and then go away.
[03:22:49.768 --> 03:22:52.130]  Because remember, an audit is really only scary
[03:22:52.891 --> 03:23:01.638]  If there is something they are trying to assert, whether or not there is a discrepancy or not, does not mean they're not going to assert that you owe more money.
[03:23:01.638 --> 03:23:03.460]  They definitely may do that.
[03:23:03.460 --> 03:23:10.426]  But if we have all our T's crossed and our I's dotted, they will not be able to do that.
[03:23:10.426 --> 03:23:20.093]  And so that is a way that we can proactively make sure by looking at your account, the crypto transactions you have, your small business, the way everything's set up,
[03:23:21.014 --> 03:23:24.717]  Even if you are flagged, that way the flag will be removed.
[03:23:24.717 --> 03:23:26.018]  And by the way, you're an amazing young guy.
[03:23:26.018 --> 03:23:27.259]  I've been around for over a decade.
[03:23:27.259 --> 03:23:28.339]  You're a lawyer.
[03:23:28.339 --> 03:23:31.202]  But the reason we want you guys is we used you previously.
[03:23:31.202 --> 03:23:37.506]  Your co-owner is like 75 years old and a very well-known tax expert who we're going to be getting on very, very soon.
[03:23:37.506 --> 03:23:43.450]  So you have a lot of... I'm older now, but back when I was 25, 30, people said, what's this young guy?
[03:23:43.450 --> 03:23:46.192]  Even though I was smart and doing well, this guy looks a little too young.
[03:23:46.192 --> 03:23:47.033]  I don't listen to him.
[03:23:47.033 --> 03:23:49.235]  You got a bunch of old dudes, old ladies working for you.
[03:23:49.955 --> 03:23:51.056]  I certainly do.
[03:23:51.056 --> 03:23:54.619]  Half of my legal staff is over the age of 50.
[03:23:54.619 --> 03:23:56.901]  My business partner is 72.
[03:23:56.901 --> 03:23:59.403]  Not 75, I had some years there.
[03:23:59.403 --> 03:24:09.151]  But yes, one of the most brilliant people in the tax industry, I know, and we'll have him on here as well so he can share some of his thoughts with your viewers as well.
[03:24:09.151 --> 03:24:09.992]  I look forward to that.
[03:24:09.992 --> 03:24:11.653]  Tell us about that guy, because I've seen some of the stuff he's done.
[03:24:11.653 --> 03:24:13.134]  He's written books on it.
[03:24:13.134 --> 03:24:16.878]  You've got your crypto experts, like the top guy, a bunch of books.
[03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:37.523]  We have a phenomenal team at GetATaxLawyer.com, and from across the board, from people from the old school, who are used to classic taxation, these older tax attorneys are used to tax rates that were when as high as 70%, okay?
[03:24:37.523 --> 03:24:45.488]  And so my tax attorneys are telling me that if the Democrats keep having their way, this is something that may happen again.
[03:24:45.488 --> 03:24:46.809]  And so- Well, they've been called for it!
[03:24:47.529 --> 03:24:48.469]  Exactly.
[03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:57.473]  And so this is, we have people like that all the way down to, you know, my crypto people are typically younger because it's a... No, I like nothing against old folks.
[03:24:57.473 --> 03:24:59.033]  I think it's great to have the new brains.
[03:24:59.033 --> 03:24:59.193]  Yeah.
[03:24:59.193 --> 03:25:01.414]  I was just saying, you guys have got some amazing people.
[03:25:01.414 --> 03:25:02.815]  You've got the whole roster.
[03:25:02.815 --> 03:25:03.335]  You've got it all.
[03:25:03.655 --> 03:25:26.869]  We do, and I appreciate that, Alex, and you need to have a mix of both, because with the superiority, the age comes the experience, but with the new people that are fresher out of law school, out of taxation, learning about all that stuff in crypto, they're the ones that are going to be more up-to-date on, as we said, the laws that change every two years.
[03:25:27.029 --> 03:25:32.291]  So real quick, people should go to jones-relief.com, that goes to your site, that way we get some credit, and some sponsorship, or 800-869-0723, 800-869-0723.
[03:25:32.291 --> 03:25:33.952]  When they call, how easy is it?
[03:25:33.952 --> 03:25:37.773]  You just sign a consultation, do it, boom, you do an analysis, you give them an offer.
[03:25:45.137 --> 03:25:45.657]  Correct.
[03:25:45.657 --> 03:25:55.644]  So we call in, you will get put forth to one of my agents that is able to take your exact situation and then... You have different experts they go to.
[03:25:55.644 --> 03:25:57.345]  Maybe a lawyer, maybe a CPA.
[03:25:57.345 --> 03:25:57.846]  Exactly.
[03:25:57.846 --> 03:26:01.108]  When you call in, everybody's going to have a slightly different issue.
[03:26:01.108 --> 03:26:09.894]  So depending on that is depending on who we're going to send it to, that expert in that industry, and we will take care of the problem for you.
[03:26:09.894 --> 03:26:13.096]  And yes, you're going to have solutions at the end of that phone call.
[03:26:14.602 --> 03:26:20.285]  Well that's what's great, because again, other tax lawyers will make it confusing, A, because they're not smart, or B, they want more money.
[03:26:20.285 --> 03:26:22.546]  You guys just cut right to it.
[03:26:22.546 --> 03:26:39.314]  Yes, the thing is, is in the legal industry in general, there is a whole lot of clouds, because it's, we're talking about laws and arcane laws that not many people have the privilege to even understand, and so we cut through all that
[03:26:40.054 --> 03:26:40.795]  We're good to go.
[03:26:58.846 --> 03:27:03.749]  Individuals are taxed at a graduated rate up to 37 percent.
[03:27:03.749 --> 03:27:05.389]  That's like 15 to 37.
[03:27:05.389 --> 03:27:06.210]  Correct.
[03:27:06.210 --> 03:27:11.273]  Now, that means if you're making over $100,000, which, you know, is middle class.
[03:27:11.273 --> 03:27:12.073]  That's not rich.
[03:27:12.073 --> 03:27:18.156]  Now suddenly you're paying more than what a corporation would pay to make 10 times the amount of money.
[03:27:18.156 --> 03:27:25.320]  So if you're making more money than that, you really need to give us a call so we can examine the type of entity structuring that you're in.
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:29.523]  You're a small business and LLC is only going to get you so far.
[03:27:29.523 --> 03:27:32.866]  If you start making more money, we need to start talking about corporations.
[03:27:32.866 --> 03:27:39.851]  The difference between an S and a C, you know, and it really comes down to how much money you're making, how many employees you have, liability protection.
[03:27:39.851 --> 03:27:43.554]  These are all things that go into owning a business.
[03:27:43.554 --> 03:27:45.475]  Taxation is just one of them.
[03:27:45.475 --> 03:27:48.558]  But when you are setting up to be taxed correctly,
[03:27:49.218 --> 03:27:57.810]  You're also protecting yourself from lawsuits, and you're also protecting yourself from additional liabilities.
[03:27:57.810 --> 03:27:59.092]  And lawsuits are crazy now.
[03:27:59.092 --> 03:28:00.453]  We're graduating so many lawyers.
[03:28:00.453 --> 03:28:01.335]  Certainly are.
[03:28:01.335 --> 03:28:02.817]  In California, it's ridiculous.
[03:28:02.817 --> 03:28:04.319]  But how do people call and get the auto protection?
[03:28:04.983 --> 03:28:12.968]  So if you'd like to get the audit protection give us a call the number on the screen and just ask one of the agents and they will get you set up.
[03:28:12.968 --> 03:28:25.336]  What happened is we will send you out a power of attorney that way we are your attorney on record at the IRS and we are the ones that control your account in the sense that they're going to send us
[03:28:26.457 --> 03:28:28.959]  Paperwork saying, we want to audit this person.
[03:28:28.959 --> 03:28:30.279]  We don't think they're doing the right thing.
[03:28:30.279 --> 03:28:38.924]  And when they send that to us, we have the ability to nip it in the bud right then and there before they seize your assets or threaten to or knock on your door and scare you.
[03:28:38.924 --> 03:28:41.946]  Because they immediately go, oh, this is a law firm, totally different class.
[03:28:41.946 --> 03:28:42.366]  That's right.
[03:28:42.366 --> 03:28:43.547]  Tyler Bennett, you're going to be in the War Room.
[03:28:43.547 --> 03:28:44.067]  Great job.
[03:28:44.067 --> 03:28:45.568]  Kate Daly, thanks for letting me steal some time.
[03:28:45.568 --> 03:28:47.129]  She's an amazing talk show host.
[03:28:47.129 --> 03:28:48.670]  Kate Daly takes over.
[03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:50.851]  KateDalyShow.com, straight ahead.
[03:28:50.851 --> 03:28:52.332]  Tyler Bennett, thank you so much.
[03:28:52.332 --> 03:28:53.413]  JonesTaxRelief.com.
[03:28:56.823 --> 03:29:03.225]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[03:29:03.225 --> 03:29:07.847]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[03:29:07.847 --> 03:29:10.448]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[03:29:10.448 --> 03:29:12.869]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[03:29:12.869 --> 03:29:19.632]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[03:29:19.632 --> 03:29:23.013]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[03:29:23.653 --> 03:29:34.316]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:29:49.341 --> 03:29:51.662]  Of InfoWars MD.
[03:29:51.662 --> 03:29:55.204]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:29:55.204 --> 03:29:56.684]  InfoWars MD.
[03:29:56.684 --> 03:30:04.247]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[03:30:04.247 --> 03:30:05.888]  We're actually winning the InfoWars.
[03:30:05.888 --> 03:30:13.031]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts,
[03:30:13.331 --> 03:30:13.611]  We're good.
[03:30:28.328 --> 03:30:28.869]  We're good to go.
[03:30:58.274 --> 03:31:02.215]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[03:31:02.215 --> 03:31:11.078]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[03:31:11.078 --> 03:31:12.879]  Down-and-out sleep support.
[03:31:12.879 --> 03:31:13.659]  Liquid.
[03:31:13.659 --> 03:31:14.939]  It's very fast-acting.
[03:31:14.939 --> 03:31:16.160]  Take it under the tongue.
[03:31:16.160 --> 03:31:24.422]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[03:31:24.422 --> 03:31:26.583]  All of these compounds are documented on record.
[03:31:27.023 --> 03:31:30.786]  Help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[03:31:30.786 --> 03:31:34.908]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[03:31:34.908 --> 03:31:37.990]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent.
[03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:39.391]  They're all different formulas.
[03:31:39.391 --> 03:31:43.474]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[03:31:43.474 --> 03:31:44.715]  So, Countin' Out.
[03:31:44.715 --> 03:31:46.316]  Sold out for more than five months.
[03:31:46.316 --> 03:31:48.758]  Now back available at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:31:48.758 --> 03:31:54.561]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the InfoWar.
[03:31:54.561 --> 03:31:56.543]  With Countin' Out Sleep Support at InfoWarStore.
[03:31:57.363 --> 03:32:02.125]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[03:32:02.125 --> 03:32:07.328]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[03:32:07.328 --> 03:32:12.170]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:17.112]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[03:32:17.112 --> 03:32:26.156]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[03:32:26.636 --> 03:32:39.631]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[03:32:39.631 --> 03:32:43.575]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[03:32:44.276 --> 03:32:45.578]  Three hundred percent.
[03:32:45.578 --> 03:32:48.121]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.

[03:32:59.273 --> 03:33:05.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.156 --> 03:33:13.696]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.696 --> 03:33:18.237]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from TheKateDallyShow.com, KateDallyShow.com.
[03:33:18.237 --> 03:33:21.978]  Alright, I have a couple of things to get to, so we're going to get to them fast.
[03:33:21.978 --> 03:33:24.978]  We're going to speed right through, so keep up.
[03:33:24.978 --> 03:33:30.179]  There's a big message that I want to give about copper.
[03:33:30.179 --> 03:33:38.921]  I had an interview with Dr. Alfonso Monso, and let me just tell you, his information on copper is amazing, and I want to share just a little bit with you, if you don't mind.
[03:33:39.611 --> 03:33:47.817]  This is so instrumental to your health and I really hope you take this information in and listen, really listen to what I'm about to say.
[03:33:47.817 --> 03:33:51.019]  In 1940, they changed our food supply dramatically.
[03:33:51.019 --> 03:34:03.367]  Now, we've talked about this, I've talked about this, how things really started to change in the medical world, the taking over of the Johns Hopkins and virology, but also our food supply and the big Trojan horse to get us very unhealthy.
[03:34:03.707 --> 03:34:04.027]  I think so.
[03:34:24.691 --> 03:34:31.955]  And in so many ways, in such a sinister way, setting us up in a long-term plan for unhealth.
[03:34:31.955 --> 03:34:32.435]  Okay?
[03:34:32.435 --> 03:34:34.056]  And that's where we're at now.
[03:34:34.056 --> 03:34:38.158]  They changed copper metabolism training for doctors.
[03:34:38.158 --> 03:34:43.140]  They started taking this out of the teaching for doctors.
[03:34:43.140 --> 03:34:51.265]  And what happened was, in our bodies, copper and iron work together and copper is instrumental to our brain.
[03:34:51.265 --> 03:34:51.825]  Instrumental.
[03:34:52.645 --> 03:34:55.106]  But what they did was they started adding iron shavings.
[03:34:55.106 --> 03:34:57.746]  They started adding all of these things into our food.
[03:34:57.746 --> 03:34:59.967]  Iron shavings alone without the copper.
[03:34:59.967 --> 03:35:01.907]  Copper and iron work together.
[03:35:01.907 --> 03:35:03.287]  And they called it fortified.
[03:35:03.287 --> 03:35:06.588]  Like in your cereal, you're eating iron shavings, okay?
[03:35:06.588 --> 03:35:08.988]  Not healthy for your body at all.
[03:35:08.988 --> 03:35:12.849]  Then what they did was they started just testing for iron, right?
[03:35:12.849 --> 03:35:14.169]  You go in, you get an iron test.
[03:35:14.169 --> 03:35:18.330]  They say you're low in iron and you need to beef up the iron in your blood.
[03:35:18.330 --> 03:35:21.171]  The problem is that a blood test isn't accurate for iron.
[03:35:21.886 --> 03:35:28.268]  It actually hides in the tissues and it mixes with oxygen, okay, as it hides in the tissues.
[03:35:28.268 --> 03:35:29.808]  They're not doing a tissue test.
[03:35:29.808 --> 03:35:30.928]  They're doing a blood test.
[03:35:30.928 --> 03:35:31.869]  It's not accurate.
[03:35:31.869 --> 03:35:35.189]  So what it does is it mixes with oxygen and it creates rust.
[03:35:35.189 --> 03:35:39.591]  And when it creates rust, it causes inflammation and oxygen levels drop.
[03:35:46.161 --> 03:35:49.102]  And copper helps run your oxygen.
[03:35:49.102 --> 03:35:51.023]  Zinc helps run your oxygen.
[03:35:51.023 --> 03:35:55.624]  So energy levels start dropping and you're not low in iron.
[03:35:55.624 --> 03:35:59.005]  You're low in copper and it's in the wrong place.
[03:35:59.005 --> 03:36:01.987]  So copper and fat run the brain, right?
[03:36:01.987 --> 03:36:03.727]  They run the brain.
[03:36:03.727 --> 03:36:05.308]  So what did we have in the 1970s?
[03:36:06.764 --> 03:36:14.777]  We had a war on fat in the pyramid that they presented to us that was the most unhealthy thing, I think, that we really focused on.
[03:36:14.777 --> 03:36:16.720]  Go back to pictures of the 1960s.
[03:36:16.720 --> 03:36:21.147]  People were not largely, forgive the pun, overweight, okay?
[03:36:21.147 --> 03:36:21.908]  They were pretty slim.
[03:36:23.024 --> 03:36:28.628]  And what happened was we changed how we view fat and how we view all of our minerals.
[03:36:28.628 --> 03:36:30.869]  It's okay to keep adding in fortified minerals.
[03:36:30.869 --> 03:36:35.993]  It's okay to start adding in all this junk, but strip all the natural stuff out of our food.
[03:36:35.993 --> 03:36:38.014]  So copper and fat run the brain.
[03:36:38.014 --> 03:36:38.914]  They run oxygen.
[03:36:38.914 --> 03:36:42.577]  It has to do with red blood cells.
[03:36:42.577 --> 03:36:43.898]  They're doing so many things.
[03:36:43.898 --> 03:36:47.200]  There's also a blue spot in your brain, the locus corallis.
[03:36:47.680 --> 03:36:50.923]  And this is supposed to deliver copper into your brain.
[03:36:50.923 --> 03:36:54.445]  Remember, fat and copper run the brain.
[03:36:54.445 --> 03:36:59.549]  Fear and anxiety reduce copper in the brain.
[03:36:59.549 --> 03:37:00.490]  Fear and anxiety.
[03:37:00.490 --> 03:37:01.491]  What have we just been doing?
[03:37:01.491 --> 03:37:03.832]  Total fear porn, right?
[03:37:03.832 --> 03:37:09.837]  And it creates sort of this cycle because the more fear is produced, the more copper is reduced.
[03:37:09.837 --> 03:37:13.140]  The more copper is reduced, the more fear is reduced.
[03:37:13.140 --> 03:37:13.640]  Strange, right?
[03:37:14.736 --> 03:37:17.959]  So if you're low in copper, the problem just compounds.
[03:37:17.959 --> 03:37:23.703]  Alzheimer's, adrenals, panic disorder, PTSD, ADHD because of your copper.
[03:37:23.703 --> 03:37:29.187]  So during intense times of trauma and stress, we reduce trace minerals in our body.
[03:37:29.187 --> 03:37:31.048]  That's what leaves our body.
[03:37:31.048 --> 03:37:36.733]  And weaponized pathogens, and here we go with the future right now, and what we're dealing with right now.
[03:37:36.733 --> 03:37:39.735]  Weaponized pathogens can be dormant for years in your body.
[03:37:40.666 --> 03:37:45.289]  All those shots that you've been receiving as a kid, you know, they told you you needed all those shots.
[03:37:45.289 --> 03:37:48.991]  I think I got eight as a kid in the 70s.
[03:37:48.991 --> 03:37:56.335]  Well, those weaponized pathogens can actually lay dormant in your body for years to come.
[03:37:56.335 --> 03:38:02.158]  When you have trauma, when you have stress, when you have an injury, like a knee injury, a hip injury, something like that,
[03:38:02.927 --> 03:38:10.675]  All of a sudden, your symptoms start up for, let's say, rheumatoid or inflammation or autoimmune or cancer.
[03:38:10.675 --> 03:38:12.977]  All these different things start coming to light, right?
[03:38:12.977 --> 03:38:14.539]  Symptoms start arising.
[03:38:14.539 --> 03:38:20.405]  It's usually the event that spawns the body into taking these out of the dormancy, right?
[03:38:20.905 --> 03:38:24.686]  That have been hiding and lingering and then all of a sudden, there you go.
[03:38:24.686 --> 03:38:34.150]  Judy Mikevitz proved this when she talked about milk and she said the milk steroids from the milk in the 80s were going to go into our bodies and create cancers later on.
[03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:48.435]  Well, in 2015, they finally had to admit that they had breast cancers and that a possible cause, possible, was the milk steroids they were using because what it does is it lies dormant in your body until something kind of coaxes it out and brings it out.
[03:38:49.517 --> 03:38:53.739]  In the movie, The Matrix, they had the field of humans, right?
[03:38:53.739 --> 03:38:55.239]  Turning humans into batteries.
[03:38:55.239 --> 03:38:55.879]  And what does he do?
[03:38:55.879 --> 03:38:59.500]  He holds up a copper battery.
[03:38:59.500 --> 03:39:06.563]  The nanotech being delivered in the shops right now, all pathogens live off of iron.
[03:39:07.526 --> 03:39:08.506]  They live on iron.
[03:39:08.506 --> 03:39:11.407]  You're getting all those iron shavings, you're getting iron in your body.
[03:39:11.407 --> 03:39:21.450]  They're telling you to get more iron, get more iron off of a blood test that is not accurately telling you about your iron level because it's hiding in your tissues.
[03:39:21.450 --> 03:39:35.175]  So what happens is all the nano technology that's being delivered in your body, delivered via these shots, and it's flu shots, it's all the shots, it's the COVID shots, it's all the shots that you've been giving, okay?
[03:39:35.175 --> 03:39:35.715]  All of those.
[03:39:36.457 --> 03:39:40.718]  What happens is, is Nanotech steals your copper.
[03:39:40.718 --> 03:39:42.559]  It steals your copper.
[03:39:42.559 --> 03:39:49.581]  And it also goes in and basically, you know, you're never going to get a test for copper.
[03:39:49.581 --> 03:39:54.043]  They usually don't do that in the men's and women's panels when you go in to go get a blood test.
[03:39:54.043 --> 03:39:55.503]  You don't know how much copper you have.
[03:39:55.503 --> 03:39:58.204]  They're always telling you you could OD on copper, which is a joke.
[03:39:59.352 --> 03:40:08.294]  But here's the deal though, the nanotech, the pathogens in your body live off the iron and then how does ivermectin really work?
[03:40:08.294 --> 03:40:18.095]  Ivermectin goes and steals the iron back out of the pathogen to starve it to death and helps to increase copper to get back into the cell.
[03:40:18.095 --> 03:40:26.077]  It's a zinc delivery system in a roundabout kind of a way, not direct because zinc and copper can work together as well.
[03:40:26.835 --> 03:40:29.298]  So copper controls zinc.
[03:40:29.298 --> 03:40:30.819]  Copper is the master.
[03:40:30.819 --> 03:40:39.469]  It binds with iron, makes you smarter, boosts mood, burns fat, prevents wrinkles, hair color, of course, heals joints, helps to reduce red blood cells.
[03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:46.677]  Most important detox men's panel and women's panel do not give you that copper reading unless you're going to specifically test for it.
[03:40:47.447 --> 03:41:08.679]  And we have enough copper, if we had enough copper in our bodies over the last 50 or 60 years without our food supply being stripped of it, of course, and with shots that deplete the immune system out of copper, would they have had a chance with this latest technology that they're doing to trick our immune system?
[03:41:09.713 --> 03:41:12.455]  Because that's what Moderna's Tal Zak said.
[03:41:12.455 --> 03:41:16.337]  He said that they were putting the software of life into your body, right?
[03:41:16.337 --> 03:41:20.300]  You already have a software system in your body and they're going to add to it.
[03:41:20.300 --> 03:41:23.702]  And what they're adding to it is pretty sinister.
[03:41:23.702 --> 03:41:25.143]  So I'm screwing it up.
[03:41:25.143 --> 03:41:28.725]  I had a farmer in the Midwest reach out to me and he said, you know, they're not with the cows.
[03:41:28.725 --> 03:41:30.806]  They're not giving them mineral licks, salt licks.
[03:41:30.806 --> 03:41:33.088]  They're not doing that anymore.
[03:41:33.088 --> 03:41:33.548]  Why?
[03:41:33.548 --> 03:41:37.731]  So it doesn't come into our food supply, into our bodies and transfer to us?
[03:41:37.731 --> 03:41:38.151]  Probably.
[03:41:39.275 --> 03:41:40.016]  It's scary, isn't it?
[03:41:40.016 --> 03:41:42.437]  It's kind of a scary thought of what they're doing.
[03:41:42.437 --> 03:41:46.981]  Everybody should be doing two milligrams a day of copper.
[03:41:46.981 --> 03:41:51.444]  And you have to build up slowly because it's the great detoxifier.
[03:41:51.444 --> 03:41:53.186]  That's what's so important about this.
[03:41:53.186 --> 03:41:54.427]  It's the detoxifier.
[03:41:55.202 --> 03:41:58.785]  You know, last week I talked about Siemens, right?
[03:41:58.785 --> 03:42:07.391]  And that horrid New World Order company, I can't talk today, from Germany is doing with their little health engineers, right?
[03:42:07.391 --> 03:42:15.797]  Their little health juniors, I don't even know what they call them, coming in with these tests saying, if you can get sick this year, and what does that mean?
[03:42:15.797 --> 03:42:21.881]  Does that mean that you're put into some sort of quarantine for six months because you could get sick?
[03:42:21.881 --> 03:42:23.082]  Not sick, but could be.
[03:42:23.928 --> 03:42:24.848]  Could be.
[03:42:24.848 --> 03:42:26.409]  That's what's coming.
[03:42:26.409 --> 03:42:28.690]  Is that how they absorb property rights?
[03:42:28.690 --> 03:42:30.371]  There's so much to talk about today.
[03:42:30.371 --> 03:42:32.092]  Is that how they absorb property rights?
[03:42:32.092 --> 03:42:38.115]  You're hauled off to a place in quarantine because you might get sick and they take over your property for non-payment?
[03:42:38.115 --> 03:42:46.519]  There's all kinds of things I need to go over in the next segment, but I wanted you to be aware of copper because it's so instrumental to what's going on right now.
[03:42:46.519 --> 03:42:50.200]  It can get rid of that nanotechnology too and make your body work.
[03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:51.881]  Be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:51.881 --> 03:42:52.902]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:42:57.031 --> 03:42:59.053]  InfoWars has made history.
[03:42:59.053 --> 03:43:01.675]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[03:43:01.675 --> 03:43:04.857]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[03:43:04.857 --> 03:43:08.299]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[03:43:08.299 --> 03:43:09.861]  Let's win the war.
[03:43:09.861 --> 03:43:11.622]  The information war.
[03:43:11.622 --> 03:43:16.406]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping InfoWars on air and the fight for liberty.
[03:43:16.406 --> 03:43:18.207]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[03:43:18.467 --> 03:43:32.575]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four-coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.
[03:43:32.575 --> 03:43:37.197]  And you can get $30 off this historic pure silver coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[03:43:37.197 --> 03:43:38.238]  No more of these will be made.
[03:43:44.121 --> 03:43:44.941]  You want the coin?
[03:43:44.941 --> 03:43:50.222]  It's exclusively available right now for a limited time at 1776coin.com.
[03:43:50.222 --> 03:43:54.183]  $30 off when you use promo code 1776.
[03:43:54.183 --> 03:43:56.883]  Thank you for your support.
[03:43:56.883 --> 03:43:59.864]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[03:43:59.864 --> 03:44:04.405]  But we're so stupid we let them tell us we deserve it.
[03:44:04.405 --> 03:44:10.926]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[03:44:10.926 --> 03:44:11.466]  And I looked.
[03:44:13.942 --> 03:44:29.995]  And behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[03:44:29.995 --> 03:44:39.703]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
[03:44:39.703 --> 03:44:41.785]  The book of Revelation.
[03:44:43.837 --> 03:44:45.499]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[03:44:45.499 --> 03:44:47.221]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[03:44:47.221 --> 03:44:48.783]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[03:44:48.783 --> 03:44:50.144]  This is our fight.
[03:44:50.144 --> 03:44:51.486]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[03:44:51.486 --> 03:44:52.948]  The Globalists even admit it's a leak.
[03:44:52.948 --> 03:44:56.592]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:44:57.119 --> 03:45:03.345]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[03:45:03.345 --> 03:45:11.734]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[03:45:11.734 --> 03:45:13.976]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[03:45:13.976 --> 03:45:17.459]  Now that was a three-coin series, the founding member coin.
[03:45:17.459 --> 03:45:20.843]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[03:45:21.523 --> 03:45:28.246]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[03:45:28.246 --> 03:45:37.269]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left and yes there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[03:45:37.629 --> 03:45:43.411]  The coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[03:45:43.411 --> 03:45:48.992]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast, and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[03:45:48.992 --> 03:45:50.192]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:45:56.798 --> 03:46:09.286]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:46:12.106 --> 03:46:22.353]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:46:22.353 --> 03:46:34.183]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:46:34.183 --> 03:46:35.724]  This is why they attack us.
[03:46:36.204 --> 03:46:38.725]  This is why we need your support.
[03:46:38.725 --> 03:46:40.525]  Because we tell the truth.
[03:46:40.525 --> 03:46:42.725]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:42.725 --> 03:46:44.166]  Join the resistance.
[03:46:44.166 --> 03:46:45.466]  Buy products.
[03:46:45.466 --> 03:46:47.266]  Donate to the cause.
[03:46:47.266 --> 03:46:48.627]  Share the links.
[03:46:48.627 --> 03:46:51.027]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[03:46:51.027 --> 03:46:58.489]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:46:58.489 --> 03:47:03.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:04.390]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.896 --> 03:47:14.556]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.556 --> 03:47:16.657]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:47:16.657 --> 03:47:17.217]  All right.
[03:47:17.217 --> 03:47:29.059]  The reason I added that in at the end of that whole copper thing, because you really need to be taking copper right now, is because there are some scary things, and I should have added that in last week when I was talking about Siemens and the damage they're doing.
[03:47:29.059 --> 03:47:30.440]  They took over our trains.
[03:47:30.440 --> 03:47:32.460]  They're implementing all kinds of things.
[03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:36.361]  If you have to take a train for social credit to get a loan on a house, things like that,
[03:47:37.061 --> 03:47:44.646]  Um, they're going to be, you know, absolutely going after our behaviors and our behaviors will dictate whether you get to have things in your life.
[03:47:44.646 --> 03:47:49.229]  Also, the fact that they are dying, dying, I'm full of puns today, right?
[03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:53.711]  Dying to get you into a center because you might get sick.
[03:47:53.711 --> 03:47:56.813]  And this is coming and this is such a big deal right now.
[03:47:56.813 --> 03:48:03.097]  And they even referenced this just a little bit in the Declaration of North America, the DNA statement from King Frodelot.
[03:48:04.039 --> 03:48:18.206]  So Mexico's, I want to talk about this for a second, Mexico's Labrador, I call him Labrador, the King for Adelaide, and of course, Justin Castro, met in Mexico City for the 10th North American Leaders Summit.
[03:48:18.206 --> 03:48:20.948]  Yeah, this is where we go regional.
[03:48:20.948 --> 03:48:25.690]  And the leaders, they said, are determined to fortify our region's security.
[03:48:25.690 --> 03:48:32.534]  Nothing about America's borders, just the region as a whole, you know, because we're in regions all over the globe now.
[03:48:33.302 --> 03:48:35.363]  Cut up into what, like six sections?
[03:48:35.363 --> 03:48:45.248]  Anyway, so they were just wanting to get this information out to you that our whole security revolves around diversity, equity, and inclusion, of course.
[03:48:45.248 --> 03:48:50.291]  You know, being trans or gay, that has something to do with our entire region's security.
[03:48:50.291 --> 03:48:59.496]  And then, of course, climate change garbage lies, and then competitiveness, migration, and development, health, and regional security.
[03:48:59.496 --> 03:49:00.336]  They got together to,
[03:49:01.727 --> 03:49:04.488]  Who knows what they do in their little meetings.
[03:49:04.488 --> 03:49:08.650]  I don't even want to know because it just sounds so sinister.
[03:49:08.650 --> 03:49:09.951]  It's beyond belief.
[03:49:09.951 --> 03:49:15.854]  But here's some of the lines that they wrote out of this Declaration of North America because obviously we've gone regional.
[03:49:15.854 --> 03:49:18.235]  You're just not aware of it yet.
[03:49:18.235 --> 03:49:19.856]  Have we lost our country completely?
[03:49:19.856 --> 03:49:20.896]  Possibly.
[03:49:20.896 --> 03:49:23.458]  We are not just neighbors and partners.
[03:49:23.458 --> 03:49:27.200]  Our people share bonds of family and friendship and value.
[03:49:27.200 --> 03:49:27.880]  What does that even mean?
[03:49:28.433 --> 03:49:29.554]  What does that even mean?
[03:49:29.554 --> 03:49:30.775]  We're not just neighbors?
[03:49:30.775 --> 03:49:31.616]  We are neighbors!
[03:49:31.616 --> 03:49:33.959]  That's exactly what we are!
[03:49:33.959 --> 03:49:38.964]  And there's borders between us to dictate actual borders.
[03:49:38.964 --> 03:49:49.535]  Anyway, they went on to promote racial justice, expand protections for LGBTQ and that tiny parcel of America, and deliver equitable outcomes.
[03:49:50.242 --> 03:49:52.343]  They also talked about Indigenous people.
[03:49:52.343 --> 03:49:55.625]  Everything is always about Indigenous people with these guys.
[03:49:55.625 --> 03:49:58.606]  Native American population is 2.6 million people.
[03:49:58.606 --> 03:50:01.548]  Half of those might be women, 1.3 million.
[03:50:01.548 --> 03:50:12.193]  But we, they are going to do every single thing in the name of Indigenous people for sustainable solutions and job creation and Indigenous-led growth.
[03:50:12.193 --> 03:50:13.394]  What in the hell?
[03:50:13.394 --> 03:50:18.236]  Anyway, they want to continue to build societies where Indigenous women and girls can live.
[03:50:18.236 --> 03:50:19.057]  I guess without men.
[03:50:19.057 --> 03:50:19.797]  How fun.
[03:50:20.923 --> 03:50:24.925]  And then lead without fear through the Trilateral Working Group.
[03:50:24.925 --> 03:50:26.466]  I seriously cannot talk today.
[03:50:26.466 --> 03:50:28.887]  Trilateral Working Group.
[03:50:28.887 --> 03:50:34.670]  They also said they want to get together and really commit to gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls.
[03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:36.451]  Men, you get nothing.
[03:50:36.451 --> 03:50:43.795]  I also wanted to talk about the fact that they were really touting the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.
[03:50:43.795 --> 03:50:47.097]  This bold new framework for regional responsibility.
[03:50:47.097 --> 03:50:48.497]  Everything is regional now.
[03:50:48.497 --> 03:50:49.598]  Nothing is the USA.
[03:50:51.362 --> 03:51:09.840]  They were sharing that 21 leaders endorsed on the margins of the 9th Summit of the Americas, whatever the hell that is, and the three countries of North America, which made ambitious commitments under the Los Angeles Declaration, working together, of course, to advance labor mobility in North America.
[03:51:09.840 --> 03:51:10.821]  Not Mexico.
[03:51:10.821 --> 03:51:11.742]  Not Canada.
[03:51:11.742 --> 03:51:12.823]  Oh no, just here.
[03:51:13.843 --> 03:51:14.343]  Just here.
[03:51:14.343 --> 03:51:21.706]  They really, really want a lot of labor mobility, you know, just slinging people across the border to be able to come here.
[03:51:21.706 --> 03:51:25.448]  And they also talked about promoting regular pathways for migration.
[03:51:25.448 --> 03:51:31.670]  Just regular, just come on through, you know, get those eggs under your belt, that dozen eggs that you're just dying to bring over.
[03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:40.954]  And so you could make a whole whopping 10 bucks and then we'll take you into LA and train you and coddle you and I don't know, breastfeed you.
[03:51:40.954 --> 03:51:41.414]  Who knows?
[03:51:41.414 --> 03:51:42.135]  Who knows what they're going to do?
[03:51:43.095 --> 03:51:48.019]  They've got this whole system working for the last six months and they're really, really touting it.
[03:51:48.019 --> 03:52:06.012]  So, they also talked about influenza and they talked about the North American Regional Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza to improve prevention, preparedness, agility, and provide rapid response, of course, to health emergencies in North America.
[03:52:06.012 --> 03:52:07.853]  What health emergencies?
[03:52:07.853 --> 03:52:10.215]  What have we got going on here?
[03:52:11.042 --> 03:52:12.202]  Not much, right?
[03:52:12.202 --> 03:52:15.163]  They can't obviously keep riding the COVID cloud.
[03:52:15.163 --> 03:52:16.384]  So what are they doing?
[03:52:16.384 --> 03:52:18.785]  Oh, they talked about what's to come.
[03:52:18.785 --> 03:52:25.207]  And they said this includes influenza and beyond, like some science fiction movie.
[03:52:25.207 --> 03:52:34.490]  They also talked about their bolstered, shared continental security against domestic, regional and global threats, including cyber threats, but as a region, not a country.
[03:52:35.137 --> 03:52:36.358]  Talk about a treason.
[03:52:36.358 --> 03:52:42.442]  Talk about a total treasonous jackass running, not running the country.
[03:52:42.442 --> 03:52:45.745]  He's not really running the country, and you and I both know that, right?
[03:52:45.745 --> 03:52:45.985]  Right?
[03:52:45.985 --> 03:52:56.452]  The group working behind him, he is just the awful face that we have to look at with his, you know, who am I, where am I kind of thing going on, which really was just a slap in the face to us.
[03:52:56.452 --> 03:52:59.955]  They wouldn't put anybody bright up because we're not that bright as a people, I think.
[03:52:59.955 --> 03:53:01.336]  I think we've been so dumbed down.
[03:53:02.148 --> 03:53:12.695]  But they also are taking a consistent approach to the collection, use, processing, retention, and protection of this thing called PNR, Passenger Name Records Data.
[03:53:12.695 --> 03:53:18.099]  And what that means is, is when people travel together, they collect all the information.
[03:53:18.099 --> 03:53:22.782]  Even if you cancel a trip, they still will take everyone's information.
[03:53:22.782 --> 03:53:24.724]  And it's beyond what you think, too.
[03:53:24.724 --> 03:53:29.127]  It's a lot more information than just an email address and the name of the person.
[03:53:29.127 --> 03:53:31.048]  They want to know who's traveling together.
[03:53:31.730 --> 03:53:35.094]  And the information never goes away, always stored.
[03:53:35.094 --> 03:53:37.096]  It's very, very bizarre.
[03:53:37.096 --> 03:53:45.264]  They're also using the growing global synthetic drug threat as this weird cover for the drug dialogue.
[03:53:45.264 --> 03:53:46.865]  It's very, very strange.
[03:53:46.865 --> 03:53:48.367]  And all it means is more control.
[03:53:49.448 --> 03:54:04.701]  They also said in partnership with indigenous peoples that they're going to protect biodiversity to work toward ending deforestation and looking to conserve 30% of the world's land and waters by 2030.
[03:54:04.701 --> 03:54:16.350]  Remember in the Rockefeller document of 2010 and it talked about the fact that they would just cordon off lakes and rivers and waters and streams and tell the people that they had been under attack and something was wrong with them.
[03:54:16.350 --> 03:54:18.112]  So they needed to be cordoned off for 20 years.
[03:54:20.109 --> 03:54:27.071]  So I know life straws are popular and all the water filtration, but the problem is getting to the water.
[03:54:27.071 --> 03:54:29.992]  Getting to the water is going to be an issue.
[03:54:29.992 --> 03:54:32.332]  30% of the world's land and waters by 2030.
[03:54:32.332 --> 03:54:44.576]  In my state, that doofus we call Romney actually is going after the Great Salt Lake and they're mining their lithium, but they don't want anybody to know that.
[03:54:44.576 --> 03:54:48.477]  They just really want to just take it over in conservation because it's in danger.
[03:54:49.341 --> 03:55:03.956]  This is going to be happening more and more and more, and your lakes and your rivers and all of those bodies of water are going to be subject to a lot of things that they plan in coming in.
[03:55:03.956 --> 03:55:10.963]  The other thing I also wanted to mention, and I know I'm going fast, but that document was scary because it was so regional.
[03:55:10.963 --> 03:55:12.104]  It was so regional.
[03:55:13.124 --> 03:55:16.266]  Um, never even discussing the USA really.
[03:55:16.266 --> 03:55:24.572]  Only working as a body in a region because Labrador and Castro and Fratelot are all in together to make sure we work as a region.
[03:55:24.572 --> 03:55:26.554]  The other thing was embedded vision.
[03:55:26.554 --> 03:55:30.476]  They talk about the Internet of Things, but they hardly ever talk about the vision of things.
[03:55:30.476 --> 03:55:41.404]  The camera technologies that we have in our phones, the things that they have been working on that we think it's just all about taking a photo, a good picture, or for VRs, you know, to lay out and kind of map different areas.
[03:55:42.523 --> 03:55:54.470]  That technology is going to be used in droids and in your cars, all of the things that need vision, the vision of things.
[03:55:54.470 --> 03:56:01.435]  All of that technology, all of those patents are going to be used in creating a type of vision
[03:56:02.293 --> 03:56:04.735]  That is comparable to human vision.
[03:56:04.735 --> 03:56:07.297]  Human vision, we are totally different, right?
[03:56:07.297 --> 03:56:16.886]  We can assess, we can look, we can observe, we can know what's spatial, you know, kind of like into a spatial sense, all of those things.
[03:56:16.886 --> 03:56:19.088]  But a computer actually has to be taught that.
[03:56:19.088 --> 03:56:23.872]  And vision being one of the most important senses that we have because it can do so much.
[03:56:23.872 --> 03:56:27.255]  There is so much in our future that is going into the
[03:56:30.114 --> 03:56:38.320]  The human type robot, the drones, the ability to sense as a human does.
[03:56:38.320 --> 03:56:46.546]  Whenever we think of technology, you have to go 10 steps further to kind of figure out where that technology lands us.
[03:56:46.546 --> 03:56:49.208]  And it's not in a good place, obviously.
[03:56:49.208 --> 03:56:50.009]  We can stop this.
[03:56:50.009 --> 03:56:51.450]  We can work towards stopping this.
[03:56:52.495 --> 03:56:59.017]  I know that there are committees and certain politicians on both sides of the aisle saying, oh, we're going to look into this.
[03:56:59.017 --> 03:56:59.697]  Look into it.
[03:56:59.697 --> 03:57:00.957]  You're a little late, honey.
[03:57:00.957 --> 03:57:05.899]  It's this has been 50, 60, 70, 80 years in the making.
[03:57:05.899 --> 03:57:08.199]  And so we have we have to catch up.
[03:57:08.199 --> 03:57:09.880]  Basically, we have got to catch up.
[03:57:10.583 --> 03:57:12.224]  We've got fraud a lot at the helm.
[03:57:12.224 --> 03:57:16.527]  We've got a lot of people working to destroy this country, destroy our boundaries.
[03:57:16.527 --> 03:57:27.273]  But the tech that's coming in, which we'll talk about next week when I'm on, then the tech that's coming in and smart cities is far above and beyond what anybody understands where it's going.
[03:57:27.273 --> 03:57:28.834]  And it's insane.
[03:57:28.834 --> 03:57:30.275]  They want it to be insane.
[03:57:30.275 --> 03:57:30.975]  They don't care.
[03:57:30.975 --> 03:57:33.737]  They're telling you it's insane.
[03:57:33.737 --> 03:57:35.017]  But you can still stop it.
[03:57:35.017 --> 03:57:37.839]  People can say no, they don't have to consent.
[03:57:37.839 --> 03:57:38.740]  But we have to do it in mass.
[03:57:40.589 --> 03:57:41.652]  And that's our problem.
[03:57:41.652 --> 03:57:43.476]  We've got to get the masses to understand.
[03:57:43.476 --> 03:57:45.179]  I'm Kate Daly for the Alex Jones Show.

[03:58:53.864 --> 03:59:00.285]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:59:00.285 --> 03:59:05.406]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:59:05.406 --> 03:59:07.107]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:59:07.107 --> 03:59:13.468]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[03:59:14.248 --> 03:59:19.692]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've ever had.
[03:59:19.692 --> 03:59:24.015]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:59:24.015 --> 03:59:33.061]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:59:33.061 --> 03:59:34.082]  God bless you all.
[03:59:34.082 --> 03:59:35.663]  I salute you.
[03:59:35.663 --> 03:59:36.744]  I thank you.
[03:59:36.744 --> 03:59:42.108]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:59:42.728 --> 03:59:44.089]  The fight is my fight.
[03:59:44.089 --> 03:59:44.709]  It's your fight.
[03:59:44.709 --> 03:59:45.450]  It's our fight.
[03:59:45.450 --> 03:59:46.251]  God bless you all.
