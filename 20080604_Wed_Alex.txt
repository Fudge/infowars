[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:05.191]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:13.675]  I am not Alex Jones, I'm Jason Bermes, and I will be subbing in the rest of the week.
[00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.797]  Alex, however, has huge breaking news!
[00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:47.778]  The elite to come in to their annual meeting where they will discuss geopolitics and decide what's good for you and me.
[00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:51.080]  And it doesn't necessarily have to be good, folks.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.362]  We're also going to have a few guests on the show today, of course.
[00:00:55.194 --> 00:01:16.803]  This Wednesday, June 4, 2008, we're going to have Adam Cunnington of Kentucky We Are Change, Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado, Daniel Estalon, of course, the author of a book we carry over at Infowars.com on the Bilderberg Group, and of course, he's in Endgame with Jim Tucker.
[00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:19.364]  We had Jim Tucker on yesterday.
[00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:22.245]  And Alex will be joining us for the full third hour, I believe.
[00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.151]  Hopefully Alex is going to call in the first hour.
[00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.873]  We're going to take calls in the first hour as well.
[00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:33.616]  And I might even give a call to Blair Gadsby after the break.
[00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:41.561]  Blair is the man who is basically on a hunger strike right now to talk to John McCain.
[00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:44.503]  Now, I am no fan of John McCain.
[00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:49.266]  John McCain, of course, wrote the forward to Popular Mechanic's book, Debunking 9-11 Myths.
[00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:52.854]  And we're going to read an excerpt out of that.
[00:01:52.854 --> 00:02:02.202]  But the Arizona Central is, I'm sorry, the Arizona Republic newspaper out there is finally reporting on this in a pretty non-slanted manner.
[00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:11.169]  I've heard conspiracy theorists, whack jobs, they leave that rhetoric out of this article and I'm going to read it for you right now.
[00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.813]  An Arizona state senator is petitioning presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain
[00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:27.438]  To meet with 9-11 conspiracy theorists, including an adjunct professor from Scottsdale who has been fasting outside McCain's office for more than a week.
[00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:43.771]  State Senator Karen Johnson, a Mesa Republican, delivered a letter to McCain's Senate office Tuesday asking her to sit down with Scottsdale activist Blair Gadsby and a pair of leading members of the 9-11 truth movement to consider alternative explanations
[00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:51.742]  Before the September 11, 2001 attacks and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.
[00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:55.907]  Gatsby's fast outside McCain's Senate office entered its 10th day today.
[00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:57.168]  Wow.
[00:02:57.168 --> 00:02:58.770]  I can't imagine not eating for 10 days.
[00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.693]  I think I've gone, what, a day and a half, two days without eating?
[00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:03.415]  And that's because I was sick.
[00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:04.836]  10 days?
[00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:05.597]  Godspeed, man.
[00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:11.898]  There are so many questions left unanswered, said Johnson, who called for a new, independent investigation into the attacks.
[00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:18.686]  She had previously been focused on media attention for her vocal misgivings about the government account of 9-11.
[00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:25.334]  Again Tuesday, she said, there's no explanation, no legitimate explanation, about why the towers and Building 7 came down.
[00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:25.554]  Folks,
[00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:36.736]  It's a 10,000-page report by NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, commissioned by the government, in which they don't even tell you how the towers collapsed.
[00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:39.617]  They try to explain away collapse initiation.
[00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:40.557]  Okay, let's say it again.
[00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:42.298]  Collapse initiation.
[00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:45.159]  And then they say that global collapse ensues.
[00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:54.422]  When John Grosvenist was confronted about this, and asked about the molten metal, he denied the molten metal that was under 1, 2, and 7.
[00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:55.742]  Plenty of eyewitnesses' accounts.
[00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:57.572]  Check out Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:03:57.572 --> 00:03:59.193]  They're in there.
[00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:04.634]  And he denied any knowledge of the NASA thermal imagery that showed these extreme hot spots.
[00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:06.214]  I don't know anything about that.
[00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.515]  Why don't you email it to me?
[00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:08.355]  That sounds good.
[00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:13.196]  Now the person asking him this is a professor at the college that he's speaking at.
[00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:20.418]  So this professor goes and approaches Mr. Gross afterwards and he says, can I get that email so I can send you this NASA thermal imagery?
[00:04:20.418 --> 00:04:21.338]  No, I'm not interested.
[00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:21.598]  Thanks.
[00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:25.275]  I just said that because I was in front of a group of kids.
[00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:27.036]  So let's see if we can get Blair Gatsby on the line.
[00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:29.197]  Ten days without food for 9-11 Truth, folks.
[00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:31.178]  That's pretty hardcore.
[00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:32.619]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:34.860]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.701]  Remember, Alex is down in D.C.
[00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:37.342]  at Bilderberg.
[00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:38.782]  He's going to be calling in.
[00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:39.663]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.782]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:04:57.782 --> 00:05:07.250]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.356]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:21.043]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:05:21.043 --> 00:05:31.834]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.196]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:00.558]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:02.460]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.941]  The late great USA.
[00:06:03.941 --> 00:06:05.723]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:12.749]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.621]  Join the info war today!
[00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:56.582]  Are you concerned about cholesterol, blood pressure?
[00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.622]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:03.104]  Are you looking for a more natural method to help improve your health issues?
[00:07:03.104 --> 00:07:06.745]  My husband has had lots of blood pressure problems today.
[00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:08.466]  It would just be really high.
[00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.880]  The doctor had worked with him, and he'd give him some medication for a little while.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.101]  It would maybe work, and then it wouldn't.
[00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:21.323]  And he was going back and forth, and my husband's not the type that he wants to go to the doctor anyway.
[00:07:21.323 --> 00:07:23.464]  He'll wait until he is in major problems.
[00:07:23.464 --> 00:07:33.387]  So a friend gave us a bottle of Cardivite, and he started on it, and within a very short time, I'm going to say two weeks at the most, it was just leveling out.
[00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.293]  And as long as he's been on these, it has literally saved his life.

[00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:45.097]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:47.098]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:03.092 --> 00:08:06.574]  Alright folks, ask and you shall receive!
[00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:19.341]  We have Blair Gatsby on the line in his 10th day of fasting to try to sit down with John McCain who will be the presidential nominee for the Republicans and talk 9-11 truth.
[00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:25.445]  I really don't think Mr. McCain has really looked into the matter other than his basic rhetoric against Middle Eastern terrorists.
[00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:30.668]  This is the same guy who joked around and sang, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.
[00:08:31.707 --> 00:08:38.470]  And I want to remind people that Alex will be checking in all day long from DC and the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.311]  I am Jason Burmess.
[00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:44.233]  You can check out my little website at loosechange911.com.
[00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:46.254]  All right, let's go to Blair.
[00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:47.895]  Blair, how did you come up with this idea?
[00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.836]  And by the way, I can only commend you.
[00:08:49.836 --> 00:08:53.257]  I mean, I can't imagine fasting for 10 days.
[00:08:53.257 --> 00:08:56.979]  Yeah, it's not something I've ever done before, but it sure is good to be here talking to you.
[00:08:57.914 --> 00:08:58.955]  How did I come up with it?
[00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.516]  Good question.
[00:09:00.516 --> 00:09:06.019]  I think it was somewhat of a spontaneous idea, in that there's a convergence of issues.
[00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:18.546]  First of all, McCain's rather sudden rise to the top of the ticket and to the top of the nominee here, and the fact that I'm an Arizona resident, and the fact that he wrote this forward to this book.
[00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:21.248]  And I thought, well, this is an interesting confluence of events here.
[00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:30.972]  I wonder if that would give me any leverage to approach him and ask him about just what side of this issue is he on regarding the official 9-11 cover story.
[00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:51.035]  Absolutely, and in Alex's upcoming film, 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising, one of the family members, someone I know personally, Dave Cahill, he's a musician, you can go check his stuff out on MySpace, but he asks him, you know, in light of the fact that many family members want a new investigation and don't feel that their questions were answered, in fact 70% of their questions,
[00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:52.056]  We're good to go.
[00:10:15.674 --> 00:10:22.095]  9-11 conspiracy movement exploits, now we're exploiting people folks, the public's anger and sadness.
[00:10:22.095 --> 00:10:30.597]  No, I think that was the mainstream media and the mainline government that exploited the public's anger and sadness in order to invade two sovereign nations, but I guess that's just me.
[00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:41.799]  Traffics in ugly, unfounded accusations, of course he hasn't looked at these accusations or he would know they're more than founded, of extraordinary evil against fellow Americans.
[00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:41.919]  Hmm.
[00:10:42.662 --> 00:10:44.383]  Now, I gotta ask you, Blair.
[00:10:44.383 --> 00:10:45.083]  Yeah, it's very odd.
[00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:46.724]  Well, what brought you into 9-11 Truth?
[00:10:46.724 --> 00:10:50.785]  What was the overwhelming piece of evidence that you just said, you know what?
[00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:52.006]  This story's not adding up.
[00:10:52.006 --> 00:10:53.607]  I better look into this.
[00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:56.228]  Uh, these people might have something here.
[00:10:56.228 --> 00:11:01.570]  It built really when, I mean, initially when they came out and said they hate us because we are free.
[00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.831]  That's where they attacked us.
[00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:04.611]  Well, this is preposterous.
[00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:08.233]  I mean, right on the face of it, how do you, how is hate generated in someone's heart?
[00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:10.596]  Because somebody else has freedom.
[00:11:10.596 --> 00:11:12.918]  I could see envy, but not hate.
[00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:21.985]  So, as a religious studies professor, and I even teach a course on Islam and the other world religions, I mean, this was obviously a distortion, to say the least.
[00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:27.629]  Now, that was early on and immediate, but that certainly was not a 9-1-1 truther, if you will, at that point.
[00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.929]  In early 2003,
[00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:35.865]  Uh, in reading Gore Vidal's book, he made the suggestion, I think it was Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, or his, uh, Dreaming War.
[00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.565]  Alright, Blair, can I just get you to hold?
[00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:39.346]  I'm sorry, man, but I have Alex on the line.
[00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:40.326]  He wants to come on right now.
[00:11:40.326 --> 00:11:42.326]  Can you hold over until the next segment?
[00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.106]  I can, sure.
[00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:44.287]  Alright, thank you so much, Blair.
[00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:49.788]  Alright, let's go right to Alex Jones, from D.C., Bilderberg Conference, 2008.
[00:11:49.788 --> 00:11:51.128]  Alex, are you with us?
[00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:52.449]  Yeah, Jason, don't interrupt.
[00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:53.909]  I told you I was gonna call at this time.
[00:11:53.909 --> 00:11:54.469]  Yep, nope.
[00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:56.230]  Um, um, I'm all about it, sir.
[00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.950]  How are things going?
[00:11:57.808 --> 00:12:04.553]  Okay, I am here at Build or Burn 2008 at the West Spoons.
[00:12:04.553 --> 00:12:08.896]  Literally, as we speak, I have security people following me, asking questions.
[00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:14.300]  You pull anywhere, they'll jump all over you, get in your face.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.323]  And they don't even start arriving until tomorrow morning, but all their advanced teams were here last night.
[00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:20.464]  Of course, we're standing nearby.
[00:12:20.464 --> 00:12:25.608]  Also got a room here tomorrow morning.
[00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:32.197]  Covering everything that's happening.
[00:12:32.197 --> 00:12:44.627]  And it's very important that everybody understands that the decisions that are going to be made here in the next few days will probably govern whether they attack Ireland or not.
[00:12:44.627 --> 00:12:50.211]  We know that it will meet every fifth year, every five years in North America.
[00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:52.033]  Two years ago in Ottawa.
[00:12:52.033 --> 00:12:55.156]  Now they're back here in Odessa, Kenya.
[00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:03.239]  Um, most experts, um, including Jim Tucker, who I looked at this morning.
[00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:06.921]  He's not staying here, but he just arrived and he's in South Carolina eating lunch.
[00:13:06.921 --> 00:13:09.202]  We're going to talk about some more.
[00:13:09.202 --> 00:13:17.166]  Uh, but all the experts agree that the fact that they're meeting here, um, means that war is looked at in the streets, on a table.
[00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:18.967]  We don't know if we're going to play that card.
[00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:20.808]  They're going to play that card.
[00:13:20.808 --> 00:13:26.671]  Uh, if the United States is going to be sucked into it and be drugged back into it, or, uh, if Iran
[00:13:27.987 --> 00:13:29.568]  This is so important.
[00:13:29.568 --> 00:13:31.310]  They met here, of course, in 2002.
[00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:37.715]  It's a very bold thing that I'm standing in front of, right here in front of the main entrance.
[00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:47.763]  And the fact that they're meeting here again, you later learn some minutes that got leaked in some of our sources, and it turned out to be accurate intelligence.
[00:13:47.763 --> 00:13:49.144]  It always is when it comes from Jim.
[00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:50.545]  In fact, I've never seen Jim be wrong.
[00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:54.569]  I've seen other people be right about 90% of the time, 95% of the time.
[00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:57.371]  Jim is always, and in 2002, he came on my show.
[00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:24.587]  During the meeting here in Chantilly, and said that the fact that they had met here, and that his intelligence had on him that they're going to be attacking Iraq in March of that year, but that would be in 2003, in March.
[00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:30.793]  That would be correct.
[00:14:30.793 --> 00:14:32.394]  I've got people watching me walk around.
[00:14:32.394 --> 00:14:34.456]  It's wobbling a bit here.
[00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:39.941]  But just to be clear on my report, Tucker and others have said that the fact that we're meeting here in D.C.
[00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:47.308]  only two years after meeting in North America, the fact that they met here to plan the Iraq War in 2002 for March of 2003 shows that the War Council meeting
[00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:54.436]  They're having here really clear.
[00:14:54.436 --> 00:15:01.659]  I am at bill or two time if they shut the hotel They said we have to be out in the morning.
[00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:12.903]  I'll be surprised we got it's not Before then there are How much dirty that I saw even in Iowa or I saw it will I
[00:15:13.385 --> 00:15:14.185]  Yes, it's coming in clear.
[00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:15.026]  Am I coming in clear now?
[00:15:31.744 --> 00:15:34.906]  Okay, let me give some people just a clear report from the start.
[00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:41.190]  I am here at Bilderberg 2008 in Chantilly, Virginia at the Westfields Marriott Hotel.
[00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:55.060]  The last time they met here was in 2002, and accurate leaks that were then proven to be correct that the attack on Iraq would not be in 2002, but that it was going to be happening in March of 2003.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.122]  The reason that's important is the Washington Post, New York Times,
[00:15:58.722 --> 00:16:14.047]  Everybody else in the mainstream media were reporting that the attack was on in the next few months in Iraq and told the public that it didn't happen and it happened in March of 2003.
[00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:20.869]  The power of Bilderberg showed how they truly do better and make decisions and time and time again
[00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:27.102]  Has been accurate with sources, so it's the most accurate in their sources.
[00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:30.463]  Forecasting was going to happen in a year, two years, three years.
[00:16:30.463 --> 00:16:35.404]  Just like they said they'd be paying dollars a gallon two years ago.
[00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:38.805]  They said that oil was going to go well above $100 a barrel.
[00:16:38.805 --> 00:16:42.306]  Now it's been at $125 a barrel for weeks.
[00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:45.566]  This shows that these people really do govern our planet.
[00:16:45.566 --> 00:16:48.707]  And so we see these big shows of Barack Obama.
[00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:51.868]  We see these big shows going on right now.
[00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:57.325]  With Hillary Clinton and the rest of it, I know he's the presumptive nominee.
[00:16:57.325 --> 00:16:58.386]  None of that.
[00:16:58.386 --> 00:17:00.367]  People are literally pocket change.
[00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:10.772]  That's in their book, and we've done our part to present one of the books that show that Barack Obama is being handled manipulatively.
[00:17:10.772 --> 00:17:12.133]  This is John McCain.
[00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:19.997]  He's handling control of the very same institutions, and it's just like
[00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:27.789]  There at the Brook Street Hotel, surrounded by Raytheon and Lockheed, and driving in here was even worse.
[00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:35.932]  I saw every major defense contractor, you know, literally like 30 of them every week.
[00:17:35.932 --> 00:17:37.533]  Hold on Alex, you broke up there.
[00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:41.754]  You saw, yeah, you saw every major defense contractor, is that what you said?
[00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:42.915]  I'll do it.
[00:17:42.915 --> 00:17:45.476]  Go get on the hotel line, and is this a bad sell?
[00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:48.369]  It's pretty rough, yeah, it's pretty rough.
[00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:53.452]  You've been breaking up in and out, but you were saying that... Listen, everybody disregard this report.
[00:17:53.452 --> 00:17:56.695]  When are you going to have the fellow testing off?
[00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:59.777]  I just had him call in and he'll be out after this segment, so...
[00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:03.737]  Okay, well, I'll just call in at the factory after, okay?
[00:18:03.737 --> 00:18:04.317]  Alright, sounds good.
[00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:05.337]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:18:05.337 --> 00:18:05.758]  There he is.
[00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:07.118]  He's at Bilderberg, folks.
[00:18:07.118 --> 00:18:10.260]  And, like he said, double the security.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.481]  It's days before.
[00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:12.561]  Got there a little early.
[00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:13.802]  Scoped out the situation.
[00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:16.723]  He's going to be calling back on a landline, so he's a little bit more clear.
[00:18:16.723 --> 00:18:17.844]  Broke up in and out.
[00:18:17.844 --> 00:18:22.546]  Alright, let's go back to Blair Gadsby, a religious studies professor.
[00:18:22.546 --> 00:18:25.388]  I believe you teach in Scottsdale, Arizona, Blair?
[00:18:25.388 --> 00:18:26.268]  That's correct.
[00:18:26.268 --> 00:18:29.970]  Mace, actually, but it's a sister of colleges here in the Maricopa County.
[00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:42.413]  And we were discussing what really will come up, and you said that, you know, just the fact that they said, hate us for our freedoms got your mind working, but what was it that really pushed you over the edge to check out 9-11 Truth?
[00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:50.059]  Well, I think that it was a subtle shift over to the so-called lie hop theory, when Gore Vidal, as I mentioned in the story, one or other of these two earlier,
[00:18:50.575 --> 00:18:51.035]  I think so.
[00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:16.941]  Yeah, it's really hard to explain how a 47-story skyscraper that holds every intelligence agency under the sun, from the FBI to the largest CIA office outside of DC,
[00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:29.130]  All I can say is just keep the pressure on the media.
[00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.110]  I'm targeting John McCain, remember.
[00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:37.232]  I'm trying to zero in on the fact that I believe he has been deceived by these scientists and I want to snatch him back from those forces that have pulled him over.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.281]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:03.003]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:08.305]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:20:08.305 --> 00:20:19.529]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:21.870]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.330]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.251]  Let's face it.
[00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:28.091]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:20:28.091 --> 00:20:36.092]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:20:36.092 --> 00:20:38.393]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:20:38.393 --> 00:20:41.513]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:20:41.513 --> 00:20:45.574]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:20:45.574 --> 00:20:47.755]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.

[00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:54.379]  Act now.
[00:20:54.379 --> 00:21:07.512]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:21:07.512 --> 00:21:11.336]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:18.578]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:21:18.578 --> 00:21:21.979]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:29.882]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[00:21:29.882 --> 00:21:36.984]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[00:21:37.344 --> 00:21:45.507]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[00:21:45.507 --> 00:21:48.127]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:21:48.127 --> 00:21:53.449]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:21:55.526 --> 00:21:59.968]  Ted Anderson for Midas June 4, 2008 Gold 883.50 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $909.33, $447.95 for half, $223.98 for quarter.
[00:21:59.968 --> 00:22:00.449]  That's $909.33, $447.95, and $223.98.
[00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:15.744]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:18.845]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:28.350]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:33.653]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:36.515]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:22:36.515 --> 00:22:39.358]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.721]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:42.721 --> 00:22:46.504]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:22:46.504 --> 00:22:46.804]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.804 --> 00:22:46.984]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.039 --> 00:23:02.625]  Hi, my name is William Lewis, and if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are, you've probably seen one or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years.
[00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:08.028]  9-1-1 in plain sight, Beyond Treason, or maybe 9-1-1 Ripple Effect.
[00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:14.193]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am, and wondering, what else have they done, and what are we gonna do about it?
[00:23:15.023 --> 00:23:25.405]  My latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change while at the same time exposing the scope of the President's immoral and illegal spy program.
[00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:32.927]  We reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, and other very intrusive spy bills.
[00:23:32.927 --> 00:23:40.269]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posse comitatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of Rights.

[00:24:04.033 --> 00:24:05.814]  Alright folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:05.814 --> 00:24:06.414]  We are back.
[00:24:06.414 --> 00:24:07.815]  We just let Blair Gatsby go.
[00:24:07.815 --> 00:24:09.596]  Let's, uh, let's really support him.
[00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:22.482]  He's out there in Arizona, 10th day without any food whatsoever, in front of McCain's office, just petitioning to talk to the man and try to show him some of this evidence that 9-11 was indeed an inside job.
[00:24:22.482 --> 00:24:25.563]  Building 7 says it all itself.
[00:24:25.563 --> 00:24:26.984]  Alex Jones called in his, uh,
[00:24:28.001 --> 00:24:31.102]  Cell phone was a little shaky, but let's try to recap a little bit what he said.
[00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:33.703]  He said twice as much security as in 2006.
[00:24:33.703 --> 00:24:37.164]  He said security has shown up a day before it's scheduled.
[00:24:37.164 --> 00:24:40.366]  He has to be out of the hotel early in the morning.
[00:24:40.366 --> 00:24:42.506]  Tomorrow, he was obviously very silent.
[00:24:42.506 --> 00:24:44.027]  He felt like he was being followed.
[00:24:44.027 --> 00:24:45.648]  He talked about defense contractors.
[00:24:45.648 --> 00:24:51.950]  He also discussed how the last time it was in Chantilly, Virginia was in 2002, and we discussed that with Jim Tucker yesterday.
[00:24:52.952 --> 00:25:03.856]  And it really allows for a lot of the upper echelons of the military, of the Washington insiders, of the bureaucrats that run the system in D.C.
[00:25:03.856 --> 00:25:06.637]  to come over and stop over for a meeting for only a couple hours.
[00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:08.318]  It really allows access.
[00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:13.220]  So I think this is going to be a big, big Bilderberg meeting.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:21.863]  And we can't wait for Alex to call back, hopefully on a landline, and give us a little bit better of a report where we can hear every single word that he is saying.
[00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:29.302]  That being said, most talk shows would have started out with this info, but I haven't even talked about it yet.
[00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:35.365]  We had Mike Rivera on yesterday, and we started to talk about the Democratic nomination for the presidency.
[00:25:35.365 --> 00:25:38.586]  And he said it looks like Barack Obama.
[00:25:38.586 --> 00:25:41.408]  No, we discussed Hillary Clinton, and don't count her out yet.
[00:25:41.408 --> 00:25:44.069]  But indeed, it looks like it will be Barack Obama today.
[00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:52.674]  He is the seemingly, I guess unopposed at this point, nominee for the Democratic Party.
[00:25:52.674 --> 00:26:02.880]  But when I went to CNN.com this morning to check out the story, the first spin they put on it, Will Hillary Vy for the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:09.464]  Now I have been an advocate that it was going to indeed be a Hillary Obama or an Obama Hillary ticket.
[00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:17.673]  And that if it was not that ticket, that John Edwards would step in and be the VP for either candidate, I am still sticking by that.
[00:26:17.673 --> 00:26:33.199]  I understand that, well, Obama would be a fool to choose Hillary Clinton after she's joked a couple times that he may be shot and killed or assassinated when the last assassination of that nature prior to the elections was Robert Kennedy back
[00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:34.297]  We're good to go.
[00:26:58.752 --> 00:27:28.543]  to take uh... george h w bush as his vice presidential candidate was not something he was looking forward to in fact i don't think it's something he wanted remember george h w bush comes up uh... as the head of the c i a out of nowhere supposedly although he was a clandestine officer from all accounts prior to that or you wouldn't just be the head of the c i a folks they don't just throw anybody in there they throw people who have in long history of intelligence in keeping secrets and being manipulative in there then he becomes vice president for eight years and let's not forget
[00:27:29.457 --> 00:27:34.080]  That Reagan is actually shot on the day of a presidential succession drill.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.263]  We talked to Michael Rivera a little bit about that yesterday.
[00:27:38.263 --> 00:27:42.065]  And then Bush becomes president for four more years.
[00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:49.190]  And the follow-up to him is Billy Boy Clinton, or as I like to call him, Bilderberg Bill Clinton, now that he's actually admitted to attending Bilderberg.
[00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.671]  We played that clip on the air yesterday.
[00:27:52.139 --> 00:27:56.520]  And Bilderberg Bill Clinton was one of his drug runners in the 80s.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.781]  Okay, let's be clear.
[00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:01.262]  Our government runs a lot of the drugs in this country.
[00:28:01.262 --> 00:28:04.003]  In fact, the majority of the cocaine, the majority of the heroin.
[00:28:04.003 --> 00:28:07.064]  They have a pretty good hold on the marijuana trade.
[00:28:07.064 --> 00:28:13.546]  The people that you see going to jail are those that aren't paying their cut, that aren't playing by the rules.
[00:28:13.546 --> 00:28:18.767]  And Billy Boy Clinton was more than happy to run drugs through MENA Arkansas.
[00:28:18.767 --> 00:28:20.488]  And he is a great speaker.
[00:28:20.488 --> 00:28:21.248]  I mean, Bill Clinton
[00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:24.310]  Man, he is a snake charmer, isn't he?
[00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:29.712]  When I saw that, when he actually admits to Bilderberg, he's just getting hooted and hollering, and everybody's cheering.
[00:28:29.712 --> 00:28:31.873]  He's like a god of Olympus.
[00:28:31.873 --> 00:28:33.393]  He can do no wrong.
[00:28:33.393 --> 00:28:35.074]  People don't even know what he's saying.
[00:28:35.074 --> 00:28:36.755]  He's just putting a positive spin on it.
[00:28:36.755 --> 00:28:38.776]  The economy was better when I was president.
[00:28:38.776 --> 00:28:40.956]  We enforced trade laws when I was president.
[00:28:40.956 --> 00:28:42.037]  I love America.
[00:28:42.037 --> 00:28:44.278]  We're not gonna throw their interests away.
[00:28:44.278 --> 00:28:45.578]  Oh yeah, I went to Bilderberg.
[00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:47.579]  I know, yeah, they set policy there, but I wasn't there
[00:28:47.984 --> 00:28:49.465]  to set any North American policy.
[00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:55.490]  I was just there to sit in on some meetings with some Europeans about what was going to happen to Russia.
[00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.853]  Total bull, total nonsense.
[00:28:58.853 --> 00:29:03.817]  Alright, let's get into some positive news.
[00:29:03.817 --> 00:29:14.866]  There's not a lot of that these days, but I just want to let people know that the courts have ruled, Missouri lawmakers have ruled, that they're going to make it a crime
[00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:21.920]  If people are ordered to be microchipped in their arms from private businesses.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.040]  Well, good!
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.481]  There's no way my job should say, well, you want to keep your job?
[00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:28.081]  Here's a little chip.
[00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:31.182]  It's almost like that biometrics thing for your kids the other day.
[00:29:31.182 --> 00:29:40.185]  Remember the websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and we do a live video stream over at PrisonPlanet.tv during the fourth hour, so check that out.
[00:29:40.185 --> 00:29:41.745]  Alex Jones is going to be calling back soon.
[00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:43.625]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:44.467]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:45.850]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.395]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:51.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.263 --> 00:29:58.848]  Imagine, a firefly, simple and innocent.
[00:29:58.848 --> 00:30:01.712]  The ability to light the night sky.
[00:30:01.712 --> 00:30:04.976]  The ozone layer, unseen by the naked eye.
[00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:06.859]  Life-sustaining.
[00:30:06.859 --> 00:30:10.484]  Our ocean, primordial soup breathes life.
[00:30:10.484 --> 00:30:12.466]  Bring the wonders of nature home.

[00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:31.105]  We're good to go.
[00:30:54.264 --> 00:30:56.225]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:59.846]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:59.846 --> 00:31:02.187]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:31:02.187 --> 00:31:05.349]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:31:05.349 --> 00:31:11.071]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:31:11.071 --> 00:31:14.993]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:31:15.313 --> 00:31:20.514]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:32:44.263 --> 00:32:45.264]  The world's best air purifiers.
[00:33:42.415 --> 00:33:45.577]  All right, we are back.
[00:33:45.577 --> 00:33:49.019]  Missouri workers can't be forced to get microchip implants.
[00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:50.620]  That's some good news, actually, folks.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.222]  They can't force you in a couple states to get microchip implants.
[00:33:54.222 --> 00:33:55.823]  I'm glad they're making these laws.
[00:33:55.823 --> 00:34:03.027]  It's been found to, uh, you know, form cancer in rats and other animals, and there's no reason it needs to be in a human being.
[00:34:03.027 --> 00:34:12.093]  Although, uh, one of the debunkers over at the JRAF forums, uh, unsecured coins, ha ha ha ha ha, very funny, unsecured coins
[00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:15.416]  A few weeks back, he goes in for a checkup.
[00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:17.597]  He wasn't scheduled for one for about five years.
[00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:18.938]  This guy's military.
[00:34:18.938 --> 00:34:22.901]  He goes in, he passes with flying colors, and then they stamp this thing with RFID.
[00:34:22.901 --> 00:34:25.363]  They say, come back next week, next Thursday.
[00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.984]  We're going to chip you.
[00:34:26.984 --> 00:34:29.225]  And there's nothing he can do about it.
[00:34:29.225 --> 00:34:31.887]  There's this big thread, and people are like, well, why don't you just refuse it?
[00:34:31.887 --> 00:34:34.149]  He's like, well, then my career goes down the tubes.
[00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:38.772]  And we can't have our careers go down the tubes, because then you can't pay your mortgage or your car payment.
[00:34:38.772 --> 00:34:40.173]  And you can't send your kid to college.
[00:34:40.549 --> 00:34:44.851]  Or if they're a toddler, you can't put them into Little League because you don't have the money.
[00:34:44.851 --> 00:34:46.112]  Okay, that's how they get you.
[00:34:46.112 --> 00:34:56.496]  They put you into a system first, they get you comfortable in that system, they get you to dedicate your life to that system, and then they put more restrictions on you.
[00:34:56.496 --> 00:34:58.937]  So, let's go ahead and read this article.
[00:34:58.937 --> 00:35:02.579]  Your bosses can still make you work weekends and give you projects you loathe.
[00:35:03.493 --> 00:35:10.075]  But Missouri lawmakers have voted to make it a crime if they order a microchip to be implanted in your arm.
[00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:10.715]  Duh!
[00:35:10.715 --> 00:35:12.415]  It's common sense!
[00:35:12.415 --> 00:35:15.476]  Of course there should be a law that can't force you to put a microchip in your arm.
[00:35:15.476 --> 00:35:16.996]  What do you want?
[00:35:16.996 --> 00:35:22.438]  Forcing someone to get microchip implanted is barred in California, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.
[00:35:22.438 --> 00:35:31.600]  Legislating awaiting Governor Matt Blunt's signature would make it a misdemeanor with a fine of up to $1,000 for a boss who demands that a worker get an implant. $1,000?
[00:35:33.462 --> 00:35:35.083]  Let's make it $10,000, huh?
[00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:36.023]  Let's make it really hurt.
[00:35:36.023 --> 00:35:37.064]  Let's make it $100,000.
[00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:39.565]  Let's hurt their pocketbook.
[00:35:39.565 --> 00:35:39.725]  $1,000.
[00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:44.187]  They might even be... Most of their employees probably make $1,000 a week.
[00:35:44.187 --> 00:35:45.988]  Come on.
[00:35:45.988 --> 00:35:46.008]  $1,000.
[00:35:46.008 --> 00:35:46.808]  That's nothing.
[00:35:46.808 --> 00:35:49.409]  That kind of makes me sick.
[00:35:49.409 --> 00:36:02.536]  Catherine Albright, an expert in consumer privacy and radio frequency identification, that's RFID, folks, acknowledges that microchip implants might sound like black helicopter and tinfoil hats.
[00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:03.196]  No, it doesn't!
[00:36:04.229 --> 00:36:08.894]  Listen, a family went on television in 2001.
[00:36:08.894 --> 00:36:13.738]  They went on the Today Show and got chipped.
[00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:20.024]  The crazed mom got on there and said, Oh, it's gonna help us protect from terror.
[00:36:20.024 --> 00:36:21.366]  The government loves us.
[00:36:21.366 --> 00:36:22.567]  I want to do what I can.
[00:36:23.342 --> 00:36:24.843]  And she said it was her little kid's idea.
[00:36:24.843 --> 00:36:26.865]  I think the kid was like 11 or 12 at the time.
[00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:27.926]  Some kind of techie.
[00:36:27.926 --> 00:36:29.448]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:36:29.448 --> 00:36:32.631]  Let's listen to my 11 or 12 year old kid about getting chipped.
[00:36:32.631 --> 00:36:33.652]  He knows.
[00:36:33.652 --> 00:36:38.337]  He's into technology and then it comes out they were actually on a payroll.
[00:36:38.337 --> 00:36:45.163]  Verichip was paying them an ungodly amount of money to promote this and act like it was just the best thing since breakfast.
[00:36:45.163 --> 00:36:45.864]  Well, it's not!
[00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:53.347]  And you can go on eBay right now, and for about $10 to $15 you can get one of these microchips that you can chip your dog with.
[00:36:53.347 --> 00:36:55.109]  But, you know, it's a microchip.
[00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:56.190]  It's like a hypodermic needle.
[00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.971]  You can put it in anything.
[00:36:56.971 --> 00:36:58.112]  You can put it in you if you'd like.
[00:36:58.112 --> 00:36:59.915]  You can put it in your shoe.
[00:36:59.915 --> 00:37:05.501]  And then you subscribe to a service, and you're part of a GPS tracking program.
[00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:06.242]  It's really nice.
[00:37:06.242 --> 00:37:06.743]  It's good stuff.
[00:37:09.164 --> 00:37:19.531]  But the founder of Antichips.com and other critics argue they are tangible medical privacy and religious worries driving attempts to pass laws banning forced implants.
[00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:20.312]  Yeah.
[00:37:20.312 --> 00:37:24.034]  The people who oppose it don't understand how real the threat is.
[00:37:24.034 --> 00:37:27.497]  And the people who are gung-ho don't understand its power, Albright said.
[00:37:28.402 --> 00:37:40.378]  Albright's been trying to persuade state lawmakers across the country to pass legislation regulating technology that allows for tagged items to be tracked when microchips send off a radio signal to special readers.
[00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:43.643]  The information can be linked to a database, and they're so easy to hack.
[00:37:44.417 --> 00:37:45.858]  Listen, it's an electronic device.
[00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:47.540]  Electronic devices can be hacked.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.801]  They can be manipulated.
[00:37:48.801 --> 00:37:50.823]  They can do so rather easily.
[00:37:50.823 --> 00:37:55.688]  So when they say that you're going to be safe and secure and no one can take your microchip, it's a load of bull.
[00:37:55.688 --> 00:37:57.790]  Yeah, they can't physically take it out of you.
[00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:03.396]  That doesn't mean they can't put new information on it, take old information off, hack into it, clone those chips.
[00:38:03.396 --> 00:38:05.338]  I mean, there's a ton of stuff they can do with it.
[00:38:05.338 --> 00:38:06.919]  It's a computer!
[00:38:06.919 --> 00:38:07.320]  Come on!
[00:38:09.068 --> 00:38:17.951]  This year, at least 17 states have considered bills regulating or restricting radio frequency identification, or RFID, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.
[00:38:17.951 --> 00:38:19.772]  Last year, there were 13.
[00:38:19.772 --> 00:38:23.353]  So that's positive that we're, you know, upping it.
[00:38:23.353 --> 00:38:25.094]  Oh, I wish we had a law like that in New York.
[00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:26.994]  God.
[00:38:26.994 --> 00:38:28.835]  Radio tracking has been used for forcing
[00:38:29.963 --> 00:38:39.948]  For tracing stores' inventories in toll booths, quick passes, linking unconscious patients to important medical information, and even for uniting missing pets with their owners.
[00:38:39.948 --> 00:38:42.329]  Aww, so many positive things!
[00:38:42.329 --> 00:38:49.613]  But critics say the benefits pale in comparison to risks of cancer and identity theft by secretly lifting information off someone's microchip.
[00:38:50.925 --> 00:38:57.467]  The nation's only federally approved maker of human microchips implants has denied claims that its product can cause cancer.
[00:38:57.467 --> 00:38:59.708]  A spokesman for Florida-based Verichip Corp.
[00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:01.888]  did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
[00:39:01.888 --> 00:39:04.049]  Of course they didn't, because they've done the test!
[00:39:04.049 --> 00:39:06.730]  Yes, it causes cancer in mice.
[00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.271]  Just type in Verichip Cancer, please!
[00:39:09.271 --> 00:39:10.351]  Please!
[00:39:10.351 --> 00:39:15.933]  Look, this thing passed in 2004 from the FDA for human consumption.
[00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:16.633]  Okay?
[00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:18.374]  Alright, we got Alex on the line.
[00:39:18.374 --> 00:39:19.234]  Hopefully on the landline.
[00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:19.734]  Alex, you with us?
[00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:22.730]  Yes, Jason, it is incredible.
[00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.771]  Everybody's cell phones, we've got five of them.
[00:39:25.771 --> 00:39:27.992]  We'll have full bars and then no bars.
[00:39:27.992 --> 00:39:31.853]  There's definitely surveillance teams, white vans, black vans.
[00:39:31.853 --> 00:39:33.974]  Security follows us everywhere.
[00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:38.215]  I've never seen this much security and it doesn't even officially start until noon tomorrow.
[00:39:38.215 --> 00:39:45.378]  We're kicked out of the Westfields Marriott in the morning and we're staying at the Hilton
[00:39:45.996 --> 00:39:50.898]  Just a few miles away we'll have continual coverage, not just here, but on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:39:50.898 --> 00:39:51.598]  I was on last night.
[00:39:51.598 --> 00:39:54.560]  I'm giving them reports tonight and the next night.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.080]  So people can also tune in for that.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.422]  They'll get several reports during the day here over the next three days.
[00:40:00.422 --> 00:40:03.383]  And we'll also do special reports during the weekend shows on Genesis.
[00:40:03.383 --> 00:40:06.745]  And then we're going to obviously have a report on the Sunday show.
[00:40:07.342 --> 00:40:09.183]  As well, let me tell you the basics here.
[00:40:09.183 --> 00:40:10.865]  I have Jim Tucker sitting right next to me.
[00:40:10.865 --> 00:40:13.006]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[00:40:13.006 --> 00:40:14.487]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:40:14.487 --> 00:40:20.351]  They normally only meet North America every five years, but two years ago, they met in Ottawa, Canada, and we went and attended that.
[00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:23.173]  Of course, I was detained and the rest of the people know that story.
[00:40:23.173 --> 00:40:24.934]  It's covered in Endgame.
[00:40:24.934 --> 00:40:29.257]  The reason it's so important is everything Jim, in 30-plus years, has reported on Bilderberg,
[00:40:29.784 --> 00:40:30.184]  I don't know.
[00:40:51.036 --> 00:40:52.878]  At the Westfields Marriott.
[00:40:52.878 --> 00:40:54.880]  They've come back to the scene of the crime.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:01.526]  They told Rumsfeld, who attended, they said, you are allowed to attack, but you have to attack next March.
[00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:07.272]  Jim said that nine months before the attack, and it happened just as he said it would.
[00:41:07.272 --> 00:41:10.515]  So we're at the scene of the Iraq planning.
[00:41:10.515 --> 00:41:12.377]  This is a place of high treason.
[00:41:12.782 --> 00:41:20.404]  This is the place here in Virginia, right outside D.C., just a few miles in Chantilly, where they orchestrated this in 2002.
[00:41:20.404 --> 00:41:29.267]  Now, the Washington Post and others who attended lied to the public and said, oh no, it's going to be in the next few months in 2002, knowingly, premeditatedly.
[00:41:29.267 --> 00:41:31.148]  And again, Jim Tucker was right about that.
[00:41:31.148 --> 00:41:32.288]  He's got sources inside.
[00:41:32.288 --> 00:41:34.088]  We'll get the list in the next few days.
[00:41:34.088 --> 00:41:36.669]  We'll learn more and more.
[00:41:36.669 --> 00:41:39.630]  But I tell you, we are in the belly of the beast here.
[00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.471]  We are right in the heart of the monster.
[00:41:43.155 --> 00:41:46.257]  And I want to turn you over to Jim Tucker.
[00:41:46.257 --> 00:41:50.420]  Jim, Jason Bermes is sitting in for me while we're here in Virginia.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.923]  Just for a few minutes, give people a basic rundown of what you've seen so far.
[00:41:55.923 --> 00:42:01.146]  And then any questions that Jason has, he'll come back to me in about five minutes.
[00:42:01.146 --> 00:42:05.329]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Tucker, a guy who's been hounding Bilderberg for 35 plus years.
[00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:06.990]  They tried to throw us off and say it was in Greece.
[00:42:07.389 --> 00:42:09.130]  That disinfo was exposed.
[00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.453]  Here we are now, covering it, yet again, from the belly of the beast.
[00:42:12.453 --> 00:42:16.315]  Jim Tucker, American Free Press.net.
[00:42:16.315 --> 00:42:16.856]  Well, hello.
[00:42:16.856 --> 00:42:17.876]  Hi, Jim.
[00:42:17.876 --> 00:42:19.337]  How you doing, man?
[00:42:19.337 --> 00:42:19.838]  Good.
[00:42:19.838 --> 00:42:23.240]  We're in the process now of developing sources.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:30.925]  We will develop sources, and we will expose these criminals, as we do every year.
[00:42:30.925 --> 00:42:31.506]  Excellent.
[00:42:31.506 --> 00:42:34.448]  So, Alex was telling me that it's unprecedented security over there.
[00:42:34.448 --> 00:42:35.048]  What's your take?
[00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:40.209]  Well, I'm quite used to this kind of security.
[00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:45.150]  We're, of course, under constant surveillance.
[00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:55.072]  In other years, I would recognize the guard who's assigned to be reading a newspaper at the breakfast table next to mine.
[00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:59.853]  If I'm in the gift shop buying newspapers, he's in the gift shop looking around.
[00:42:59.853 --> 00:43:04.094]  And then one morning, just for the fun of it, I opened my door
[00:43:04.973 --> 00:43:08.457]  Suddenly and quickly, he was outside the door, waiting.
[00:43:08.457 --> 00:43:09.739]  So I started calling him Charlie.
[00:43:09.739 --> 00:43:10.680]  I named him Charlie.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:16.106]  I'd say, okay, Charlie, it's time now for us to go down to the cocktail lounge.
[00:43:16.106 --> 00:43:17.528]  Come on, Charlie.
[00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.649]  I'm going back to my room now.
[00:43:18.649 --> 00:43:21.512]  So I've gotten used to it.
[00:43:21.512 --> 00:43:22.594]  They're kind of cute.
[00:43:22.594 --> 00:43:23.575]  Jim, Iraq war planning.
[00:43:26.192 --> 00:43:31.615]  Listen, I want to ask Jim right now, this is important for everybody, about 2002, how they deceived us.
[00:43:31.615 --> 00:43:35.298]  Are they planning the attack on Iran, or are they nixing the plan to attack Iran?
[00:43:35.298 --> 00:43:37.939]  Everybody knows the carriers are waiting, it's all coming together.
[00:43:37.939 --> 00:43:41.241]  Jim, can you answer that question?
[00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:48.005]  Well, President Bush definitely wants to attack Iran, as if our troops are not spread thin enough.
[00:43:48.005 --> 00:43:55.830]  The European builders opposed the invasion of Afghanistan, even though the UN went along with that one, they strongly opposed.
[00:43:56.665 --> 00:43:59.567]  The invasion of Iraq.
[00:43:59.567 --> 00:44:13.616]  So as the night, 2002, as Alex said, all the newspapers, including the Bilderberg-controlled newspapers, were saying, the war is coming this summer of 2002, our early fall at the latest.
[00:44:13.616 --> 00:44:25.844]  And when Rumsfeld, then Secretary of Defense, went out to the Bilderberg meeting and assured the Bilderberg kids there would be no invasion this year, nevertheless, their pledge of secrecy
[00:44:26.756 --> 00:44:33.061]  Uh, was, uh, so treasured that they allowed their own newspapers to be wrong.
[00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:46.711]  Uh, Jimmy Lee Hoagland, who heard, uh, Rumsfeld's speech, of the Washington, Associate Editor of the Washington Post, he could have gone to the Post's newsroom and simply say, boys, stop predicting war this year.
[00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:48.112]  Uh, don't ask me how I know.
[00:44:48.112 --> 00:44:49.293]  I just know.
[00:44:49.293 --> 00:44:50.714]  I'm the Associate Editor.
[00:44:50.714 --> 00:44:51.815]  Quit predicting war this year.
[00:44:51.815 --> 00:44:52.636]  It will not happen until 2003.
[00:44:54.972 --> 00:45:01.255]  And yet, he maintains his peace and let his own newspaper be wrong for the rest of the year.
[00:45:01.255 --> 00:45:08.878]  That's just a demonstration of their fierce loyalty to their pledge of secrecy.
[00:45:09.577 --> 00:45:12.619]  So this year, do you think they're going to be discussing Iran?
[00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:20.043]  Do you think it's going to be on the table prior to the administration changing hands to either John McCain or Obama now being the nominee?
[00:45:20.043 --> 00:45:28.407]  Do you feel like they're going to be the planning of Iran at this meeting, or are they going to push it back like they did in 2002?
[00:45:28.407 --> 00:45:32.610]  Well, I think Bush wants to invade on his watch.
[00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.893]  It's so evident with all the propaganda coming out of the White House, all these
[00:45:38.709 --> 00:45:41.210]  Well, I'm hopeful that the President will be pressured out of it.
[00:46:07.822 --> 00:46:16.964]  He found himself leading the next president with a bloody war on his hands and maybe a hasty retreat as in Vietnam.
[00:46:16.964 --> 00:46:27.565]  And that would be actually pretty tough if we do put somebody like Obama into office who has pledged to end the war in Iraq and not start any more wars.
[00:46:27.565 --> 00:46:35.487]  But I feel like in order to give that some sort of legitimacy in a different administration, they would have to carry out some kind of a false flag attack.
[00:46:37.697 --> 00:46:38.758]  Yes, that's easily done.
[00:46:38.758 --> 00:46:42.701]  We've seen it before.
[00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:51.308]  In 1964, Lyndon Johnson is campaigning as the Peace President, and Barry Goldwater is being defined as the Mad Bomber.
[00:46:51.308 --> 00:47:04.898]  At that time, in August of 64, President Johnson, during the heated campaign, simply pledged to the American people a gain and a gain and a gain, even as Franklin Roosevelt.
[00:47:06.431 --> 00:47:08.373]  There would be no war.
[00:47:08.373 --> 00:47:14.758]  American boys will not be fighting wars that Asian boys ought to fight for themselves, he said.
[00:47:14.758 --> 00:47:17.620]  Then he invented the Gulf of Tonkin fiction.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:28.389]  And every survivor, well, every sailor who served on the ship in question on discharge said the ship was never attacked.
[00:47:28.389 --> 00:47:31.632]  Pure fiction about an attack called the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:47:33.993 --> 00:47:35.814]  Yes, it's not hard to invent an incident.
[00:48:00.515 --> 00:48:01.675]  So you feel like they'll do it?
[00:48:01.675 --> 00:48:04.877]  Do you feel like they have a better shot of doing this overseas?
[00:48:04.877 --> 00:48:12.940]  Something like a Gulf of Tonkin or something more homegrown like maybe a smaller scale or maybe even a larger scale 9-11 type attack?
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.701]  I certainly hope they don't resort to something so horrible.
[00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:28.506]  I think it's more likely that they'll come up with some provoked incident perhaps in the Mediterranean where the ship is allegedly attacked and they have to fire back and
[00:48:29.518 --> 00:48:36.679]  I'll kill everybody on the other ship and sink it in order to not have any dissent.
[00:48:36.679 --> 00:48:41.660]  I feel like they're going to have to have some kind of a body count, though, to get the American people behind this.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:51.082]  Maybe, you know, a destroyer going down, some of our boys, 15 or 20 soldiers killed by Iranians, some sort of provocation where American lives are lost.
[00:48:51.082 --> 00:48:57.363]  Yes, reminiscent of Pearl Harbor, which Roosevelt provoked and knew about well in advance.
[00:48:58.439 --> 00:49:07.885]  And those who apologize for Roosevelt now, real historians, no longer question the fact that he had advanced knowledge and had provoked the Japanese into the Pearl Harbor attack.
[00:49:07.885 --> 00:49:12.807]  They simply say he had to do that because the draft act passed by only one vote.
[00:49:12.807 --> 00:49:16.349]  We have to go to war in Europe, or Hitler will dictate peace terms from the White House.
[00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:17.670]  That kind of jazz.
[00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:24.454]  Well, even if you accept that argument, which I don't, why do you have to have 2,800 boys killed?
[00:49:26.405 --> 00:49:35.028]  As President of the United States, Commander-in-Chief Porter, their ships disperse off the battlefield row and scattered into the ocean.
[00:49:35.028 --> 00:49:43.611]  On that order, maneuvers that Sunday morning and have the airplanes in disguise lined up on the ground as easy targets.
[00:49:43.611 --> 00:49:49.573]  And if you only killed 800 American boys, the nation would be so outraged it would be ready to go to war.
[00:49:49.573 --> 00:49:50.313]  You don't have to kill 2,000 more.
[00:49:52.145 --> 00:50:01.367]  Well, we already know that, you know, we've tried to provocate even Iraq prior to that war into shooting down planes that were painted up with UN colors.
[00:50:01.367 --> 00:50:03.467]  And we couldn't get them to do that.
[00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:09.189]  We were unable to get Iran to attack our boats after we put out that propaganda.
[00:50:09.189 --> 00:50:15.790]  I just hope that if this does happen, enough people in the American public are going to question it and aren't going to be rabid
[00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:32.875]  For another war which seems seems on the agenda and of course, you know Bilderberg is meeting in DC like we discussed yesterday It gives them very easy access to you know, top generals top lieutenants top military guys top insiders in Washington This is the Alex Jones show.
[00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:37.177]  We will be back after this with Alex Jones and Jim Tucker Infowars.com
[00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:56.188]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:56.188 --> 00:50:59.013]  A new world order.
[00:50:59.013 --> 00:50:59.934]  In the near future.
[00:51:00.811 --> 00:51:03.874]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:51:03.874 --> 00:51:06.697]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:09.500]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.683]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:12.683 --> 00:51:20.010]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:23.035 --> 00:51:28.479]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:28.479 --> 00:51:32.341]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:32.341 --> 00:51:34.903]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:34.903 --> 00:51:36.064]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:36.064 --> 00:51:36.864]  They're not after money.
[00:51:36.864 --> 00:51:38.145]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:38.145 --> 00:51:38.746]  They're after power.
[00:51:38.746 --> 00:51:40.267]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:51.794]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:51.794 --> 00:51:52.855]  You have been warned.
[00:51:55.337 --> 00:51:59.982]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:51:59.982 --> 00:52:04.527]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.527 --> 00:52:10.853]  Another untold story that you've not been told from anotheruntoldstory.com.
[00:52:14.685 --> 00:52:24.414]  Life was hard for the 150 survivors of the sunken ship Pope, drifting days in a lifeboat after the Battle of the Java Sea in 1942.
[00:52:24.414 --> 00:52:33.041]  But it got much harder when captured and placed in the Japanese prison camp Makassar with 2,500 other prisoners of war.
[00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:41.349]  There they found themselves in the hands of cruel and barbarous captors, kicked and beaten unmercifully at the slightest provocation.
[00:52:42.307 --> 00:52:48.311]  And so it was one day for one helpless prisoner who was being beaten and clubbed to death.
[00:52:48.311 --> 00:52:52.634]  Blows from a heavy hauser were raining down on the helpless victim.
[00:52:52.634 --> 00:52:58.678]  American officer Lieutenant Richard Knott Atrium tried to stop it, but was ignored.
[00:52:58.678 --> 00:53:02.901]  What could he do to save the life of one of his men?
[00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:05.323]  Then it came to him, and he did it.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:16.046]  What he did stopped the beating, stopped it cold, and so astonished the torturous beaters, they not only stopped, but backed off in amazement.
[00:53:16.046 --> 00:53:22.470]  What he did that day not only saved a life, but won him the Congressional Medal of Honor after the war.
[00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.591]  What did he do?
[00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:29.735]  Well, for the rest of that Another Untold Story, go to AnotherUntoldStory.com.

[00:54:12.376 --> 00:54:21.643]  I am the man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my day I bid farewell to war
[00:54:35.257 --> 00:54:36.160]  Old Kentucky!
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.786]  And we're gonna have Kentucky We Are Change on a little while.
[00:54:38.786 --> 00:54:39.809]  Right now we have...
[00:54:41.084 --> 00:54:45.206]  Jim Tucker and Alex Jones live from Bilderberg on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:45.206 --> 00:54:50.448]  I just want to remind people before we go back to them that the InfoWars Money Bomb is still going on.
[00:54:50.448 --> 00:54:54.830]  We raised over $200,000 this week and we're going to give out the grand total on Friday.
[00:54:54.830 --> 00:55:04.374]  If you want to support us, you want to help us with this new TV network to get the InfoWars to the masses, because let me tell you, the mainstream media is not covering the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:55:04.374 --> 00:55:10.537]  The two gentlemen we're talking to are covering the Bilderberg Conference and the majority of the information that comes out of there are going to come
[00:55:10.957 --> 00:55:14.200]  Okay, this is Alex Jones back live.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.942]  I want to be clear here.
[00:55:15.942 --> 00:55:19.606]  History was made in the very building that I am standing in right now.
[00:55:29.949 --> 00:55:31.689]  History was made here in 2002.
[00:55:31.689 --> 00:55:47.694]  The green light was given for a completely illegal, aggressive attack where our country was brought into Iraq to suppress the amount of oil that was flowing out, to have a black hole to put now over three trillion dollars into.
[00:55:47.694 --> 00:55:49.474]  Three trillion dollar black hole.
[00:55:49.474 --> 00:55:54.796]  Meanwhile, more than four trillion has disappeared out of the pension funds via the Pentagon, the Defense Department.
[00:55:55.461 --> 00:56:06.575]  And so I just wanted to hand the phone back to Jim Tucker and say, Jim, for the worldwide radio audience listening right now, specifically, you've said on record they planned the 2003 attack of Iraq.
[00:56:06.575 --> 00:56:08.117]  We're now five plus years into that.
[00:56:08.117 --> 00:56:14.385]  Gave the green light for that here where we're standing in this very conference center, in this very luxury hotel.
[00:56:15.299 --> 00:56:18.840]  What I'm asking you is, A. Do you think they're going to attack Iran?
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.682]  B. Will they be deciding during this key meeting in Virginia?
[00:56:23.682 --> 00:56:26.682]  Is that why they're coming back to North America so early?
[00:56:26.682 --> 00:56:32.004]  How important, how historical is this meeting right now, Jim Tucker?
[00:56:32.004 --> 00:56:35.885]  Well, yes, it is a historical meeting, as Alex pointed out.
[00:56:35.885 --> 00:56:43.828]  It was when they last met here, the first meeting after the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[00:56:45.879 --> 00:56:53.265]  United States and most of the American participating in Bilderberg were all for going to war.
[00:56:53.265 --> 00:56:55.667]  The Europeans opposed it.
[00:56:55.667 --> 00:57:00.850]  Now, President Bush wants to attack Iran very badly.
[00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:06.935]  All the signs are there, all the political propaganda about what a threat they are, are there.
[00:57:06.935 --> 00:57:13.080]  I'm hoping that the Europeans... It's unusual for Bilderberg to be split on a major subject.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.501]  First time I've ever known them to be
[00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:22.375]  I'm hoping that the Europeans can pressure the United States out of attacking Iran, but I'm afraid that it might be difficult because the President is so determined to go to war in a
[00:57:43.692 --> 00:57:49.173]  Iran, no matter how much blood he leaves on the sands for the next president to deal with.
[00:57:49.173 --> 00:57:51.534]  Jim, hold on, Jason.
[00:57:51.534 --> 00:58:03.456]  Jim, can you specifically speak about, do you believe that the decision to go to war or not to go to war is going to be made this weekend?
[00:58:03.456 --> 00:58:05.657]  I really don't know.
[00:58:05.657 --> 00:58:12.218]  The Americans are going to try to make the case for war this weekend, and I'm just hoping the Europeans will
[00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:21.403]  Uh, resisted strongly enough to avoid it, but I'm afraid that the, uh... Alright, we'll be back with Jim Tucker and Alex Jones right after this.
[00:58:21.403 --> 00:58:22.744]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:22.744 --> 00:58:35.690]  They're at Bilderberg, folks!

[01:00:12.995 --> 01:00:14.937]  All right, folks, we are back yet again.
[01:00:14.937 --> 01:00:15.917]  I am Jason Burmess.
[01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:18.559]  With me, Alex Jones and Jim Tucker.
[01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:20.261]  They are reshaping Eurasia.
[01:00:20.261 --> 01:00:22.683]  The establishment has taken over Afghanistan.
[01:00:22.683 --> 01:00:24.364]  They have taken over Iraq.
[01:00:24.364 --> 01:00:26.265]  You know they want Iran.
[01:00:26.265 --> 01:00:32.811]  Are they going to decide whether or not to invade Iran this year at this Bilderberg conference?
[01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:35.012]  Let's get it straight from the sources that are there.
[01:00:35.012 --> 01:00:36.954]  Alex, Jim, what do you think?
[01:00:36.954 --> 01:00:37.634]  Is this going to be it?
[01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.075]  Are they going to decide to go into Iran?
[01:00:39.075 --> 01:00:41.037]  Is it going to be more about the presidency?
[01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.158]  What are they going to be discussing?
[01:00:42.864 --> 01:00:50.991]  Well, just for the listeners all over the world, the new stations that just tuned in, we are in Chantilly, Virginia, a bedroom community of Washington, D.C.
[01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:55.034]  at the Westfields Marriott, 2008.
[01:00:55.034 --> 01:01:03.180]  They're back at the scene of the crime where they gave the green light for the attack on Iran in 2002 and launched the attack in 2003.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.004]  Our cell phones, when they're turned off, turn on by themselves.
[01:01:08.004 --> 01:01:08.905]  We'll have full bars.
[01:01:10.478 --> 01:01:11.559]  Let us take phone calls.
[01:01:11.559 --> 01:01:14.901]  There's definitely electronic warfare going on here.
[01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:16.061]  We know that's happened in the past.
[01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:19.904]  Jim, at other events, has found bugs in his room.
[01:01:19.904 --> 01:01:21.245]  We are being followed by security.
[01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:23.466]  They're not even hiding it everywhere we go.
[01:01:23.466 --> 01:01:27.769]  When we get out our cell phones, they run up and make sure we're not using those to videotape.
[01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:39.016]  It is just absolutely amazing, but as American citizens, as free humans, we have a right to be here, to be covering what leaders from all over the world and the owners of the Fortune 100
[01:01:40.387 --> 01:01:43.933]  And royalty, the Rockefellers, the Rothschild representatives are doing.
[01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.376]  We have a right.
[01:01:45.376 --> 01:01:52.429]  And Jim always makes the point, if you had 125 movie stars meeting in secret, there'd be 50 helicopters and people freaking out wanting to know what was happening.
[01:01:53.135 --> 01:01:57.059]  Uh, but remember, just seven, eight years ago, the media still denied this even existed.
[01:01:57.059 --> 01:02:03.464]  Now, the Washington Post was even forced to admit, you know, just that, well, the headline was, is they rule.
[01:02:03.464 --> 01:02:06.047]  And said, yes, we rule the planet, we run your lives.
[01:02:06.047 --> 01:02:07.368]  And that's the key here.
[01:02:07.368 --> 01:02:10.711]  This is historical, this is important, that's why the Genesis Network's so important.
[01:02:10.991 --> 01:02:13.496]  That's why InfoWars.com, everybody's support is so important.
[01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:14.498]  That's why I thank them.
[01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:16.662]  Because this is so important, what we do.
[01:02:16.662 --> 01:02:18.586]  We risk our lives, our time, our energy.
[01:02:18.586 --> 01:02:19.607]  We're passionate.
[01:02:19.607 --> 01:02:20.249]  We're dedicated.
[01:02:20.249 --> 01:02:23.014]  And we owe so much to Jim Tucker for pioneering and exposing.
[01:02:23.482 --> 01:02:31.447]  Uh, the true tip-top of the pyramid, you know, in the super-class article they wrote for the New York Times, admitting they run the World-1 World Government, Rothkopf's is at 6,000.
[01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:35.550]  Those are the gophers, the minions, the highest level of servants.
[01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:37.331]  This is the owners of the planet.
[01:02:37.331 --> 01:02:38.692]  This is the eugenicists.
[01:02:38.692 --> 01:02:41.334]  These are the people that are poisoning our water and our food.
[01:02:41.334 --> 01:02:45.977]  These are the people that are carrying out eugenics against us with the Marisol-filled vaccines.
[01:02:45.977 --> 01:02:48.358]  We're only going to do two more minutes with Jim.
[01:02:48.358 --> 01:02:52.141]  Jim, again, any other key points you want to add?
[01:02:54.895 --> 01:03:04.862]  Well, I would add that whether or not the United States invades Iran this year might well be decided at this meeting.
[01:03:04.862 --> 01:03:17.770]  I'm hopeful that it will not happen, but I'm afraid it will because it's hell-bent to invade Iran and leave large-bodied footprints in the sands of time.
[01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:23.494]  They will also be discussing, if not celebrating, the price of oil.
[01:03:24.508 --> 01:03:40.376]  It was in, I think it was in 2005 when, I'm reaching for my memory here, but about two or three years ago, they announced that the price of oil, which was then $40 a barrel, was going to rise over the years to $140 a barrel.
[01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:43.657]  It's still $133 a barrel.
[01:03:43.657 --> 01:03:47.499]  I don't know what they're going to do with the subject, but I know it's
[01:03:48.038 --> 01:03:49.119]  Definitely on their agenda.
[01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:51.542]  Do you think we're going to hit $200 a barrel?
[01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:52.703]  Do you think that's on the agenda?
[01:03:52.703 --> 01:03:58.569]  Maybe to push it even further up so we're paying $6, $7 a gallon at the pump?
[01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:03.094]  I really don't know, but I will know when this meeting is over, I'll know.
[01:04:04.122 --> 01:04:04.362]  Excellent.
[01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:21.307]  Well, you've got to keep us posted on that because it just seems like they keep bringing up the price of gas and I've seen so many articles prepping us saying we still have it too good that they pay, you know, six, seven dollars a liter in other countries and we deserve to pay more, Jim, is what they're trying to tell us.
[01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:22.767]  Yes.
[01:04:22.767 --> 01:04:29.429]  Long Bilderberg tradition of lowering America's standard of living to the same level as in European countries.
[01:04:29.429 --> 01:04:31.970]  It would be much better for them to lift the standard of living
[01:04:32.529 --> 01:04:35.111]  In European countries at the level of the United States.
[01:04:51.474 --> 01:05:04.626]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:05:04.626 --> 01:05:08.469]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:15.693]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:05:15.693 --> 01:05:19.095]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:05:19.095 --> 01:05:26.999]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:06:53.761 --> 01:06:59.282]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:04.983]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:06.484]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.484 --> 01:07:15.366]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.

[01:07:55.751 --> 01:08:13.345]  Well, the establishment is at it again, folks.
[01:08:13.345 --> 01:08:19.329]  The eugenicists are meeting this weekend, and what will be on the agenda?
[01:08:19.329 --> 01:08:22.492]  Will it be the depopulation program that we all know about?
[01:08:22.492 --> 01:08:25.454]  Well, for sure they're going to be talking about reducing the standard of living.
[01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:32.514]  Of American citizens, as they've done over the last, you know, five to ten years, they've really lowered the standard of living in this country.
[01:08:32.514 --> 01:08:33.495]  They've upped the prices.
[01:08:33.495 --> 01:08:39.280]  Inflation is out of control, and there seems to be more and more government control of our lives.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:50.749]  Uh, Jim, you were just discussing how you were hoping that they would up the European standard of living to that of the United States, but in fact, it seems like the standard of living in the United States has gone down.
[01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:53.371]  There's literally food rationing going on in New York.
[01:08:53.371 --> 01:08:54.732]  It's something that's unheard of to me.
[01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.692]  Is this the program they're keeping up with?
[01:08:57.692 --> 01:09:01.334]  Are they going to lower our standard of living even more, Jim?
[01:09:01.334 --> 01:09:07.877]  Jason, I want you to reintroduce that great question in a moment as we close out this interview with Jim.
[01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:11.599]  I just wanted to, again, point out what Jim was just bringing up.
[01:09:11.599 --> 01:09:18.963]  How they're lowering our standard of living, how they're inflating, how they're destroying the currency, the inflation.
[01:09:18.963 --> 01:09:21.504]  Jim said three years ago this was on the agenda.
[01:09:21.943 --> 01:09:30.045]  Jim only makes four or five announcements a year from his sources, from his intel, from coming back and interviewing people after the globalists leave.
[01:09:30.045 --> 01:09:31.665]  You know, they'll never talk to us beforehand.
[01:09:31.665 --> 01:09:33.385]  They've all been told they'll be fired if they talk to us.
[01:09:33.385 --> 01:09:34.686]  We've talked to a bunch of people.
[01:09:34.686 --> 01:09:40.447]  From people serving the coffee, you know, down at Starbucks, to people in the bar and the restaurant who work here at a Bell Hops.
[01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:42.387]  And they're scared.
[01:09:42.387 --> 01:09:49.328]  And, but then after they see the evil and hear the evil, and are treated like crap, they're told not to look at Bilderberg group members in the eyes.
[01:09:49.328 --> 01:09:50.809]  After they're treated like crap by this 125
[01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:57.112]  You know, global rulers, uh, who just want to dehumanize them and euthanize them and get them out of the way.
[01:09:57.112 --> 01:10:00.854]  They always give us even more intel, but Jim actually has sources inside Bilderberg.
[01:10:00.854 --> 01:10:02.715]  Not members, but some of their minions.
[01:10:02.715 --> 01:10:06.496]  But, uh, I just wanted to say, we'll have reports at the end of the show again today.
[01:10:06.496 --> 01:10:12.019]  If anything big happens, I'll call in another Genesis Show, and I will be, uh, live again on air with you tomorrow.
[01:10:12.019 --> 01:10:12.939]  You're doing a great job.
[01:10:12.939 --> 01:10:14.300]  Jason, I appreciate it.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.921]  And, of course, Friday, and then Saturday, and then coming back on Sunday.
[01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:21.683]  But yes, bring that question back up to Jim Tucker, because it's so amazing.
[01:10:22.225 --> 01:10:27.870]  And then after you bring up that question for him, ask Jim all the predictions he's made are true.
[01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:33.374]  I mean, he said it's going to be $140 plus a barrel in the next two years, and it happened.
[01:10:33.374 --> 01:10:36.096]  And so in a few days, we're going to learn the course of our lives.
[01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:39.659]  There's no other group where you can go spy on them.
[01:10:39.659 --> 01:10:41.100]  We're spying on the globalists.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.261]  We're spying on the black hand.
[01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:46.124]  We're spying on the people that own the central banks.
[01:10:46.124 --> 01:10:47.305]  I mean, this is it.
[01:10:47.305 --> 01:10:49.767]  So bring up that population reduction
[01:10:52.057 --> 01:11:01.158]  You were pointing out about raising their control over the world while lowering our standard of living, and then bring up the fact that he's been right about the oil specifically.
[01:11:01.158 --> 01:11:01.700]  Here's Jim Tucker.
[01:11:02.628 --> 01:11:05.849]  All right, Jim Tucker joining us again, and his predictions have all come true.
[01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:07.790]  It's not like he makes these wild predictions.
[01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:14.352]  He says about three or four things a year, just like Alex said, you know, from the price of gas to the invasions into other countries.
[01:11:14.352 --> 01:11:20.313]  And we were discussing standard of living, Jim, and you were saying, well, why don't they just bring up the European standard of living to the United States?
[01:11:20.313 --> 01:11:22.514]  But what we're seeing is the opposite.
[01:11:22.514 --> 01:11:27.455]  We're seeing the lowering of the standard of living in this country to that of Europe.
[01:11:27.455 --> 01:11:28.896]  Do you think that's going to be on the agenda?
[01:11:28.896 --> 01:11:30.516]  Do you think that's going to continue?
[01:11:30.516 --> 01:11:32.037]  That's been on the agenda far.
[01:11:33.338 --> 01:11:39.122]  Decades with the Bilderberg kids.
[01:11:39.122 --> 01:11:41.043]  Everybody has a lower standard of living.
[01:11:41.043 --> 01:11:51.951]  As Alex said, they're more controllable when they're poor donkeys instead of well-to-do entrepreneurs.
[01:11:51.951 --> 01:12:00.977]  Now, we're seeing the effect, well, one-seventh of the world's population is at risk of dying of diseases and hunger.
[01:12:01.946 --> 01:12:11.118]  Because the cost of food being at a record high throughout the world because of the cost of fuel.
[01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:14.863]  And they're behind the ethanol thing, which costs even more.
[01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:19.710]  Well, we don't have ethanol pipelines like we have oil pipelines.
[01:12:20.635 --> 01:12:30.939]  But the subsidiaries from ethanol, it seems like they're shutting down a lot of farms, or a lot of farms that used to grow food for this ethanol production, which is further upping the prices of food.
[01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:31.639]  Correct, Jim?
[01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:32.439]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:49.425]  Because economists tell us that something like 40% of, on average, everything you buy, whether it's a house or a necktie or a loaf of bread, would be attributed to the cost of transportation, the long journey from raw material to finished product to marketplace.
[01:12:50.216 --> 01:13:00.443]  So when you drive up the price of food, we now have aging people in Social Security who have to give away their dogs because they need to eat the dog food at the end of the month.
[01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:03.425]  They're not taking their medications because they have to eat.
[01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:16.415]  It's a horrible situation for not just the very poor, but the not-so-poor, when their food budget costs multiply as they have.
[01:13:16.415 --> 01:13:18.256]  And when you take one-fourth of the corn crop,
[01:13:21.428 --> 01:13:24.050]  And turn it into ethanol.
[01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:30.153]  And corn is the basis of so much of our finished food products.
[01:13:30.153 --> 01:13:43.000]  And that has a tremendous impact on the price of food, which has a tremendous impact on the standard of living, directly threatening millions with starvation.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.524]  Also, as I said, causing poor people to be unable to afford their medications, to be
[01:13:50.256 --> 01:13:50.416]  I think?
[01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:05.671]  They've blown out the U.S.
[01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:24.432]  economy, they've blown out the housing market, they've upped the price of gas, they've stopped food production, and I think it is their plan to get more people on social services so that they're in the system, that they're used to getting a government paycheck, that they're used to bowing down to the government, and me and Alex were predicting if this thing goes
[01:14:25.072 --> 01:14:27.914]  Yes, Bilderberg, euphemism for all of this is population control.
[01:14:27.914 --> 01:14:30.015]  By that they mean killing the third baby, as they did in China.
[01:14:30.015 --> 01:14:31.396]  Well, that's known as abortion, I suppose.
[01:14:55.846 --> 01:15:01.910]  In fact, they're saying that the United States should pass a law permitting even that thoughtful partial birth abortion.
[01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:05.172]  That is for the babies already coming out.
[01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:13.718]  They turn it around in the birth canal to take it out feet first, which also endangers the mother more so than coming out head first as usual.
[01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:17.240]  By the way, Jim, they're also calling for a one-child policy here in the U.S.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.522]  Do you know about one-child policy?
[01:15:19.522 --> 01:15:19.802]  Yes.
[01:15:19.802 --> 01:15:21.623]  Bilderberg, introduce the question.
[01:15:21.623 --> 01:15:21.903]  Oh, yes.
[01:15:23.664 --> 01:15:35.470]  Policy is obviously aimed at reducing the population on Earth, and of course with abortion and starvation and disease, they make great progress.
[01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:44.155]  In fact, some economists tell us that 1 billion people, 1 out of 7 million people on this planet are likely to die.
[01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:46.736]  It's insane.
[01:15:46.736 --> 01:16:00.614]  ABC has this website that they redirect kids to called planetslayer.com and in it, young people, and when I say young people I'm talking 5 to 8 year olds, are led to believe that they've used up their quote-unquote carbon footprint
[01:16:00.902 --> 01:16:03.804]  Well, Bilderberg never found a tax that didn't like carbon tax.
[01:16:03.804 --> 01:16:05.304]  Their favorite world tax, though,
[01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:32.494]  I think so.
[01:16:44.718 --> 01:17:04.850]  Well, one of the big proponents of this carbon idea, other than Al Gore, seems to be Gordon Brown, who's the Prime Minister over in the UK, and he has openly discussed a new world order prior to himself being elected, and then after he was elected, it was literally on the front page of mainstream press over there, and this guy is the guy promoting this carbon tax, Jim.
[01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:07.192]  Yes, and Tony Blair was a Bilderberg kid, too.
[01:17:07.867 --> 01:17:10.989]  Do you think Gordon Brown's going to possibly be at this Bilderberg meeting?
[01:17:10.989 --> 01:17:12.169]  Has he attended before?
[01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.050]  It is very likely.
[01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:13.790]  Interesting.
[01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:18.293]  I don't know, but it's very likely.
[01:17:18.293 --> 01:17:20.774]  So who do you think are going to be some of the staples?
[01:17:20.774 --> 01:17:23.576]  We see David Rockefeller there almost every year.
[01:17:23.576 --> 01:17:25.717]  Do you feel like he's going to show up?
[01:17:25.717 --> 01:17:27.117]  Oh yes, he's there every year.
[01:17:27.117 --> 01:17:29.639]  He's quite frail now, deep into his nineties.
[01:17:29.639 --> 01:17:32.941]  He was at the Trilateral Commission meeting a few weeks ago.
[01:17:32.941 --> 01:17:35.702]  Henry Kister, of course, is regular.
[01:17:35.702 --> 01:17:37.083]  And Peter Sutherland,
[01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:41.647]  Well, they don't always invite everybody every year.
[01:17:41.647 --> 01:17:42.188]  For instance, Edwards
[01:18:02.463 --> 01:18:07.906]  Was taken in the year he was elected to be Vice President for the Democratic nomination.
[01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:08.807]  That's right, Jim.
[01:18:08.807 --> 01:18:10.888]  He's now bringing up that John Edwards was brought in.
[01:18:10.888 --> 01:18:12.109]  We've got to end this interview now.
[01:18:12.109 --> 01:18:15.131]  We're probably, from on the street, be able to get Jim.
[01:18:15.131 --> 01:18:20.294]  He always does the ceremony, the ritual of trying to walk up and get in after they've already shut it down.
[01:18:20.294 --> 01:18:26.778]  We're going to try to be live on air at around noontime, central or so, whenever Jim wants to do that.
[01:18:26.778 --> 01:18:30.201]  We're going to be bringing him down here from his hotel after we have to check out of the scene of the crime.
[01:18:31.627 --> 01:18:33.169]  Of their crime.
[01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:36.352]  And so, we'll be doing that tomorrow, but I want to thank Jim Tucker for being on the show.
[01:18:36.352 --> 01:18:39.555]  I'm going to hand it back over to you, Jason Burmas.
[01:18:39.555 --> 01:18:42.878]  Thank you so much for doing a great job while we're out of town.
[01:18:42.878 --> 01:18:45.861]  And I want to thank all the other people that are tuned into the show today.
[01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:47.243]  And again, thank everybody for the money bomb.
[01:18:47.805 --> 01:18:50.927]  The more I think about it, it just totally blows me away, and I just love all of you out there.
[01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:51.967]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:51.967 --> 01:18:53.468]  Burmus, I'm turning it back over to you.
[01:18:53.468 --> 01:18:53.708]  All right.
[01:18:53.708 --> 01:18:56.269]  Godspeed, Alex, and keep up the good work.
[01:18:56.269 --> 01:19:02.012]  Another way that we actually keep this broadcast going are our great sponsors over at Enterfood.

[01:19:39.373 --> 01:19:40.654]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:19:42.716 --> 01:19:45.078]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:51.243 --> 01:19:53.224]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:19:53.224 --> 01:19:56.826]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:58.708]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:19:58.708 --> 01:20:02.330]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:08.053]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:11.976]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:12.296 --> 01:20:17.499]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:20:49.383 --> 01:20:50.123]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:20:51.286 --> 01:20:57.948]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:57.948 --> 01:21:06.070]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:13.912]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:14.252 --> 01:21:19.336]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:19.336 --> 01:21:24.560]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.904]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:28.904 --> 01:21:30.005]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:30.005 --> 01:21:34.028]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:34.488 --> 01:21:39.390]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:42.392]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:42.392 --> 01:21:44.153]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.153 --> 01:21:44.393]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.263 --> 01:21:55.046]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:55.046 --> 01:22:00.070]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:05.534]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:05.534 --> 01:22:16.022]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:16.522 --> 01:22:20.906]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:20.906 --> 01:22:23.689]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:27.273]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:27.273 --> 01:22:39.785]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:48.291 --> 01:22:49.532]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:22:51.618 --> 01:22:57.700]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:03.641]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:23:03.641 --> 01:23:07.803]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:23:07.803 --> 01:23:12.684]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:23:12.964 --> 01:23:21.450]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:23:51.936 --> 01:23:58.543]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:02.816 --> 01:24:04.856]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:24:04.856 --> 01:24:07.557]  I am Jason Burmess, in for Alex Jones.
[01:24:07.557 --> 01:24:19.679]  Alex and Jim just giving us blockbuster material from the Bilderberg Conference, where they honestly decide what's going to happen to this country and the world over the next 12 months until they meet again.
[01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:25.580]  I mean, obviously, they have a two-week little retreat over in the Bohemian Grove, but that's around 3,000 members.
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:29.581]  And although they have a lot of things go on there, this is a more concentrated
[01:24:30.558 --> 01:24:37.922]  Group of people, only a couple hundred, and I can't tell you how important it is that we talk about Bilderberg.
[01:24:37.922 --> 01:24:56.592]  Go check out John Ronson's special where he did a little series, I think it's Adventures with Extremists, Alex has an episode, David Icke has an episode, but Jim Tucker's episode about the Bilderberg group, they literally get followed by Secret Service agents, and when they pull over, the Secret Service agents just pull over right next to him.
[01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:57.112]  They hang out.
[01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.654]  Because they are being surveilled.
[01:24:59.654 --> 01:25:07.761]  And I just want to remind people that you can get a boost to energy without this garbage rockstar energy drink or monster energy drink.
[01:25:07.761 --> 01:25:09.442]  I've seen so many energy drinks that are just
[01:25:10.074 --> 01:25:10.554]  Pretty good.
[01:25:10.554 --> 01:25:11.335]  Good afternoon, Jason.
[01:25:40.419 --> 01:25:42.360]  Now, how did you get involved in We Are Change?
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:48.882]  I mean, this is an organization that has just exploded over the past, you know, almost two years now.
[01:25:48.882 --> 01:25:51.823]  It's been a little less than two years since Luke put it together.
[01:25:51.823 --> 01:25:54.704]  Chapters throughout the country, throughout the world, really.
[01:25:54.704 --> 01:26:01.766]  And why don't you tell us a little bit about how you got started and your chapter over in Kentucky.
[01:26:01.766 --> 01:26:07.008]  Well, I didn't really see any type of real organization with anything going on here in the Louisville area.
[01:26:09.079 --> 01:26:20.182]  And for my studies within 9-11 Truth online, I came across some of the very first We Are Change videos of New York, and really appreciated what they were doing.
[01:26:20.182 --> 01:26:34.046]  You know, taking the patriotic stance, going at the people that are actually committing these crimes, atrocities, and confronting them face-to-face, and I just respected that so much that
[01:26:35.359 --> 01:26:37.022]  I had to do something.
[01:26:37.022 --> 01:26:40.749]  I had to take organizational status here in my own area.
[01:26:49.143 --> 01:26:54.544]  You just saw other people coming out doing what's right, and you said, you know what?
[01:26:54.544 --> 01:26:55.984]  I want to be a part of this.
[01:26:55.984 --> 01:27:02.825]  This is one of the few groups out there that truly is organic, that is talking about the real issues that are confronting the big boys.
[01:27:02.825 --> 01:27:03.505]  And what did you do?
[01:27:03.505 --> 01:27:05.966]  Just email Luke, and he kind of gave you a little bit of direction.
[01:27:05.966 --> 01:27:08.146]  I know that's who I send people to.
[01:27:08.146 --> 01:27:17.848]  Yeah, I just emailed Luke, asked him if it would be alright if I created a chapter here out of the Louisville area, and he pretty much
[01:27:18.741 --> 01:27:19.362]  That'd be fine.
[01:27:19.362 --> 01:27:31.472]  So I went from there, started organizing with what I found with a couple other people, and they started also an At 11 Truth global group.
[01:27:31.472 --> 01:27:40.900]  So now we've got fairly large, done such confrontations as Tom Brokaw, Lee Hamilton.
[01:27:41.989 --> 01:27:46.372]  Yeah, that was me and We Are Change Kentucky doing a combined effort with We Are Change Ohio and Cody Deeb.
[01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:15.975]  He did address your questions, but he always was spinning it.
[01:28:15.975 --> 01:28:19.399]  Were you the guy that was standing up actually asking the questions?
[01:28:19.399 --> 01:28:23.224]  No, that was Cody Dean from We Are Change Ohio.
[01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:32.260]  Oliver North is a pretty smart guy and he keeps phrasing it that this is going to be a constitutional government.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:44.570]  Now when he brings up the fact and he says, well you're getting your information from the internet and he's like, well no, I saw the hearing of Iran-Contra where Brooks asks you about it and the suspension
[01:28:45.097 --> 01:28:45.577]  We're good to go.
[01:29:03.723 --> 01:29:06.786]  You know, we're not putting foreigners in there, okay?
[01:29:06.786 --> 01:29:08.127]  And, uh, they're there.
[01:29:08.127 --> 01:29:19.558]  All you have to do is type in FEMA camps, and what really disturbs me most is that Halliburton got the private contracts to build these things, and then they took their offices and moved them out to Dubai.
[01:29:19.558 --> 01:29:21.780]  Why would they move them to Dubai?
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:24.623]  Well, so we don't have access to them if they want to round us up.
[01:29:24.623 --> 01:29:26.324]  Adam Cunnington of We Are Change Kentucky.
[01:29:26.324 --> 01:29:27.686]  We're going to talk to him on the other side.
[01:29:27.686 --> 01:29:28.907]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:41.663 --> 01:29:45.589]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:48.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.431 --> 01:29:54.032]  Do you stay up late worrying about your teen driver?
[01:29:54.032 --> 01:29:57.393]  Do you need to know the exact location of a loved one or a company vehicle?
[01:29:57.393 --> 01:30:01.374]  What can you do if your vehicle becomes one of the thousands annually targeted for theft?
[01:30:01.374 --> 01:30:08.336]  Now you can log into your own personal website and view the exact location of your vehicle stationary or moving in real time.
[01:30:08.996 --> 01:30:09.757]  24 hours a day.
[01:30:09.757 --> 01:30:17.701]  Introducing NowTrack, a revolutionary new GPS vehicle tracking device that requires no activation fee, no monthly fee, and no contract.
[01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:22.023]  Your NowTrack device is designed for self-installation discreetly in any vehicle.
[01:30:22.023 --> 01:30:28.287]  Using state-of-the-art GPS, track your vehicle via the internet or text message in all 50 states, plus Canada.
[01:30:28.567 --> 01:30:29.207]  It is a big idea.
[01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:55.843]  A New World Order.
[01:30:55.843 --> 01:31:00.306]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[01:31:00.306 --> 01:31:03.569]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:31:03.569 --> 01:31:06.371]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:31:06.371 --> 01:31:09.553]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:31:09.553 --> 01:31:16.858]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:31:19.898 --> 01:31:25.341]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:31:46.079 --> 01:31:50.502]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:31:53.513 --> 01:31:58.975]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:31:58.975 --> 01:32:00.516]  You will learn the secret to drive.
[01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:03.817]  You need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[01:32:03.817 --> 01:32:08.258]  Gas Freedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free-energy device.
[01:32:08.258 --> 01:32:13.560]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.222]  HHO, also called Brown's Gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[01:32:18.222 --> 01:32:21.183]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[01:32:21.463 --> 01:32:24.785]  This is the secret the oil and auto industry doesn't want you to know.
[01:32:24.785 --> 01:32:30.028]  Go to GasFreedom.info to learn how easy it is to extract energy from water to run your car.

[01:32:41.575 --> 01:32:42.055]  Call today.
[01:32:53.553 --> 01:32:57.316]  I think that a parasitic dream will never come back.
[01:32:57.316 --> 01:33:02.020]  And it painted my hands and my face blue.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:07.144]  And suddenly, in the fast wind, it took me away.
[01:33:07.144 --> 01:33:13.650]  And it made me fly in the infinite sky.
[01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:13.770]  Fly!
[01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:14.210]  Fly!
[01:33:26.370 --> 01:33:27.691]  Alright folks!
[01:33:27.691 --> 01:33:29.572]  We're back jamming on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.572 --> 01:33:31.653]  I am Jason Burmiss.
[01:33:31.653 --> 01:33:36.035]  And if you want to get at me personally, I'm at myspace.com slash Jason Burmiss.
[01:33:36.035 --> 01:33:37.076]  Love a few more friends.
[01:33:37.076 --> 01:33:38.857]  I got a few thousand these days.
[01:33:38.857 --> 01:33:39.957]  I know Alex has something like 50,000.
[01:33:41.298 --> 01:33:43.140]  And I use it for networking.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.761]  I actually do email people back.
[01:33:44.761 --> 01:33:46.462]  I read all the messages.
[01:33:46.462 --> 01:33:50.485]  If you want to get at me, that is probably the easiest way to do so.
[01:33:50.485 --> 01:33:53.187]  We're talking to Adam Cuttington of Kentucky We Are Change.
[01:33:53.187 --> 01:33:59.312]  They recently confronted Oliver North, lost their videotapes, got them back, threw it up on the internet.
[01:33:59.312 --> 01:34:02.174]  I'd be playing clips from that, but of course we're having
[01:34:02.776 --> 01:34:03.236]  We're good to go.
[01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:46.387]  I mean, yeah, he pretty much hit the nail on the head there that young people aren't trusting the very few media outlets that are trying to control the minds of the public out there.
[01:34:47.526 --> 01:34:55.292]  Yeah, people aren't buying into the corporate media, especially the younger people, the people that are burning copies of Loose Change and handing them out to their friends and family.
[01:34:55.292 --> 01:34:57.914]  You know, they're not going to CNN.com either.
[01:34:57.914 --> 01:35:05.420]  I mean, they might be going there linked from another place, but they don't trust the corporate media anymore because they've been caught lying again and again and again.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:08.443]  Yeah, it seems like they're scared.
[01:35:08.443 --> 01:35:09.804]  That's why he was talking about that.
[01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:11.205]  I mean, he's a reporter for Fox News.
[01:35:12.597 --> 01:35:13.177]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:13.177 --> 01:35:13.617]  He does that.
[01:35:13.617 --> 01:35:14.878]  He has that special.
[01:35:14.878 --> 01:35:16.558]  It's an hour-long show.
[01:35:16.558 --> 01:35:18.059]  I think it's about war heroes.
[01:35:18.059 --> 01:35:20.039]  He pumps his book all the time.
[01:35:20.039 --> 01:35:22.500]  I mean, this is a real insider.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:30.322]  This is one of those guys that I feel he's in the room when the think tank is going through the separate plans.
[01:35:30.322 --> 01:35:35.284]  In other words, he's listening to the ideas and the plans, and he's signing off on what he thinks, and then he goes
[01:35:35.714 --> 01:35:38.157]  And he meets with his overlords.
[01:35:38.157 --> 01:35:41.982]  You know, back in the day, that would have been people like George H.W.
[01:35:41.982 --> 01:35:44.966]  Bush, Ronald Reagan, members of their cabinet.
[01:35:45.618 --> 01:35:48.379]  And now his role is really that of a propagandist.
[01:35:48.379 --> 01:35:50.960]  Again, he's a pretty well-spoken guy.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.342]  He can misdirect very well if people don't understand the subject matter.
[01:35:55.342 --> 01:35:58.623]  I mean, it's very easy for people to say, oh, it's on the Internet.
[01:35:58.623 --> 01:35:59.683]  It's not true.
[01:35:59.683 --> 01:36:06.085]  Well, what's on the Internet are stories based on mainstream media stories with links to the mainstream media sources.
[01:36:06.085 --> 01:36:07.626]  That's what he's not telling you.
[01:36:07.626 --> 01:36:10.147]  Instead, he just says, oh, you're reading the Internet.
[01:36:11.033 --> 01:36:26.920]  Well, the Internet is just as much a viable source of information, if not more, than television and newspapers and magazines like Time at this point, because it is the only true source of open information left.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.281]  You still with us, Adam?
[01:36:28.281 --> 01:36:29.421]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[01:36:29.421 --> 01:36:29.882]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:34.191]  So how can people support you guys?
[01:36:34.191 --> 01:36:35.572]  I mean, you guys in particular.
[01:36:35.572 --> 01:36:37.794]  I mean, how many members do you have down in Kentucky?
[01:36:37.794 --> 01:36:39.015]  Do you need more members?
[01:36:39.015 --> 01:36:40.896]  I mean, obviously we could all use more people.
[01:36:40.896 --> 01:36:42.697]  We always need more InfoWarriors.
[01:36:42.697 --> 01:36:43.158]  That's right.
[01:36:43.158 --> 01:36:44.999]  We always need more InfoWarriors.
[01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.020]  So how do they get into this?
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:49.462]  Do you guys have a Kentucky WeAreChange site?
[01:36:49.462 --> 01:36:53.205]  We have KentuckyAnachange.org is our website.
[01:36:53.205 --> 01:36:56.927]  We also have MySpace, which is MySpace.com slash KentuckyAnachange.
[01:36:56.927 --> 01:37:01.871]  You can contact us through either one of those outlets.
[01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:07.110]  I really don't want to put out there what our next ambitions are as of right now.
[01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:38.969]  But I can say that we have, uh, there's a little bit of interest throughout the group to cover the, uh, 2300 Marines that will be landing in Indianapolis within the next week or two.
[01:37:38.969 --> 01:37:40.730]  I can't remember the date, I'm sorry.
[01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:41.631]  And what are they coming in for?
[01:37:41.631 --> 01:37:43.812]  Are they coming in for some kind of a massive exercise?
[01:37:43.812 --> 01:37:45.113]  Urban warfare drills.
[01:37:45.113 --> 01:37:46.234]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[01:37:46.234 --> 01:37:55.720]  They've been doing these since 99, but I'm sure they're going to say, well, now we're in a post 9-11 world, we actually have to be ready for this.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.301]  Yeah, um,
[01:37:57.992 --> 01:38:05.314]  So, we got a couple people that maybe are going to cover that.
[01:38:05.314 --> 01:38:14.577]  And also you can find information about that in the IndyStar website if anybody out there would like to find information out about that and just go help themselves.
[01:38:14.577 --> 01:38:26.320]  Also, I'm helping kick off a Central Indiana We Are Change out of Indianapolis, which you can find out information about on the Kentuckiana Change Meetup page as well.
[01:38:27.313 --> 01:38:28.015]  Excellent, excellent.
[01:38:28.015 --> 01:38:31.021]  Well, man, I just gotta tell you, keep up the great work.
[01:38:31.021 --> 01:38:35.931]  If they take your cameras, make a big stink about it, say, look, we have free speech in this country still.
[01:38:35.931 --> 01:38:37.494]  We still have a First Amendment.
[01:38:38.032 --> 01:38:39.373]  We're the new media.
[01:38:39.373 --> 01:38:41.534]  We're putting this out there for the masses.
[01:38:41.534 --> 01:38:43.795]  You don't have the right to take our stuff.
[01:38:43.795 --> 01:38:46.837]  You know, I mean, it's a big win that you did get those tapes back.
[01:38:46.837 --> 01:38:51.699]  It's a big loss for the country that the police felt like they had the right to take that from you.
[01:38:51.699 --> 01:38:54.361]  But what do you expect in this jackboot society?
[01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:57.802]  So, you know, I wish you the best of luck with this urban warfare drill.
[01:38:57.802 --> 01:39:00.784]  God knows what they're gonna do in it, but I hope you get great footage, man.
[01:39:01.636 --> 01:39:03.137]  Thank you.
[01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:04.858]  You're doing great work out there, Jason.
[01:39:04.858 --> 01:39:05.578]  You keep it up.
[01:39:05.578 --> 01:39:06.399]  All right, thanks.
[01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:08.580]  That's Adam from We Are Change, Kentucky.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.503]  I'm not sure, but we might have Jonathan Elenoff on the line right now.
[01:39:12.503 --> 01:39:14.504]  All right, he's calling him right now.
[01:39:14.504 --> 01:39:18.486]  So Jonathan Elenoff is of We Are Change, Colorado.
[01:39:18.486 --> 01:39:20.447]  And I personally know Jonathan.
[01:39:20.447 --> 01:39:25.631]  He brought Corey and Dylan and myself out there for a week out in February.
[01:39:25.631 --> 01:39:31.294]  We screened the movie to almost 2,000 people at three different screenings, two separate venues.
[01:39:32.017 --> 01:39:35.018]  Denver was just an awesome place.
[01:39:35.018 --> 01:39:37.399]  And that's where they're holding the DNC this year.
[01:39:37.399 --> 01:39:49.043]  That's where they have a provocateur group called Recreate 68, where they're encouraging you to come down so you can throw red paint on people, so you can wear a mask, and you can destroy other people's cameras.
[01:39:49.043 --> 01:39:51.364]  Yeah, that sounds like a real group.
[01:39:51.364 --> 01:39:54.745]  That sounds like an anti-protest group that has some legitimacy.
[01:39:54.745 --> 01:39:55.866]  Let's attack others.
[01:39:55.866 --> 01:39:57.246]  Let's throw paint on others.
[01:39:57.246 --> 01:39:59.427]  Let's destroy the evidence of what actually happened.
[01:39:59.804 --> 01:40:00.884]  You know what that sounds like to me?
[01:40:00.884 --> 01:40:02.185]  That sounds like provocateurs.
[01:40:02.185 --> 01:40:04.225]  That sounds like the WTO in Seattle.
[01:40:04.225 --> 01:40:05.646]  That sounds like nonsense.
[01:40:05.646 --> 01:40:08.347]  And on the line is somebody who's going to be there for sure.
[01:40:08.347 --> 01:40:09.607]  I'm gonna try to make it out there.
[01:40:09.607 --> 01:40:11.748]  I've got a wedding right after that.
[01:40:11.748 --> 01:40:20.431]  But it is very important that we go down to the DNC, we go down there peacefully, and we actually film those who would not be peaceful.
[01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:23.912]  We film those that are on the payroll of the establishment.
[01:40:23.912 --> 01:40:25.552]  I mean, they got caught in Canada.
[01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:26.493]  They had one of these guys.
[01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:27.710]  What's going on, man?
[01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:28.191]  Always a pleasure.
[01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:50.531]  Always a pleasure.
[01:40:50.531 --> 01:40:55.675]  Jonathan Elinoff of WeAreChangeColorado and TruthAlliance.net.
[01:40:55.675 --> 01:41:03.140]  Why don't you just give people a heads up of how they can get involved if they're in your area and what you guys have been up to lately?
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.502]  Well, they can come up to any of our meetings.
[01:41:05.502 --> 01:41:06.963]  We host them every Monday night.
[01:41:06.963 --> 01:41:12.047]  And they can find out about that if they go to WeAreChangeColorado.org.
[01:41:12.047 --> 01:41:17.571]  And our media, basically, our media network is TruthAlliance.net.
[01:41:18.388 --> 01:41:22.291]  And you can contact us through any of those sites.
[01:41:22.291 --> 01:41:38.765]  And, um, you know, we do everything from confronting the global elite to discussing agendas to get the word out to make sure we start recruiting more people to the truth movement and try to get some people out there and wake them up.
[01:41:38.765 --> 01:41:43.228]  And, uh, it's just, uh, there's something for everyone, I guess.
[01:41:43.228 --> 01:41:47.872]  But, um, you know, it's funny because when I wrote those articles and blew the whistle,
[01:41:48.726 --> 01:42:01.633]  I've received everything from credit and praise from people in Colorado to some people questioning why I would even do such a thing and it's been interesting coming across
[01:42:02.903 --> 01:42:10.387]  Well, it blows people's minds when you actually shatter the false left-right paradigm.
[01:42:10.387 --> 01:42:13.708]  When you say, hey man, I'm not a raging socialist leftist.
[01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:19.431]  And, hey man, I'm not a raging conservative apologist for this administration.
[01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:22.152]  I'm what you like to call a constitutionalist.
[01:42:22.152 --> 01:42:29.439]  I believe in the Bill of Rights, in the Constitution, I believe in a constitutional government, and I'm not here to abuse my rights.
[01:42:29.439 --> 01:42:31.341]  I'm not here to throw paint on people.
[01:42:31.341 --> 01:42:34.504]  I'm not here to bring a shield and incite riots.
[01:42:34.504 --> 01:42:36.245]  That's what they want you to do.
[01:42:36.245 --> 01:42:36.726]  Okay?
[01:42:36.726 --> 01:42:43.432]  It's very obvious to me that this is an op, that somebody at the top is putting this out there to try to cause violence at the DNC.
[01:42:44.571 --> 01:42:50.132]  To try to shift the focus on, you know, that we're out of control, that we don't even deserve a vote.
[01:42:50.132 --> 01:42:50.813]  I can see that.
[01:42:50.813 --> 01:42:52.653]  We don't even deserve to vote anymore, Jonathan.
[01:42:52.653 --> 01:42:55.534]  We can't, we can't stop rioting.
[01:42:55.534 --> 01:42:56.614]  But you're exactly right.
[01:42:56.614 --> 01:43:09.897]  And, um, you know, that's the whole point of peaceful revolutions and trying to get people to, to really just, you know, try to wake up to how to, how to create a revolution, what causes change.
[01:43:09.897 --> 01:43:12.258]  And if people really look at history, they'll notice that,
[01:43:12.867 --> 01:43:17.130]  The only change comes from true leadership.
[01:43:17.130 --> 01:43:21.172]  Very few times through violence has change been brought.
[01:43:21.172 --> 01:43:27.076]  Now, this country was made through violent, radical change, but that was a last resort.
[01:43:27.076 --> 01:43:29.417]  Now, we certainly are not at our last resort.
[01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:30.598]  Everyone knows that.
[01:43:30.598 --> 01:43:31.959]  We're far from that.
[01:43:31.959 --> 01:43:41.165]  There's many options, many opportunities, and when we gather in large numbers, it is so important to take advantage of peaceful, civil disobedience because
[01:43:41.556 --> 01:43:45.439]  Really, we don't really gather in large numbers anymore, and it always gets covered.
[01:43:45.439 --> 01:43:53.506]  So it's funny to see that every time it happens, there's always somebody trying to get everyone to get angry and get upset, make us look dumb and bad.
[01:43:53.506 --> 01:44:05.055]  And so those are the people I usually pay attention to, because I think either they're not familiar with what the New World Order wants us to look like or look bad, or they're just dumb.
[01:44:05.055 --> 01:44:09.058]  And it's nothing personal, but, you know, that's why it's so important that we remain peaceful,
[01:44:09.488 --> 01:44:09.848]  We do.
[01:44:09.848 --> 01:44:11.149]  We have, you know, speakers.
[01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:12.350]  We have events.
[01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:13.971]  We actually try to go to the media.
[01:44:13.971 --> 01:44:15.531]  We try to do maybe a march.
[01:44:15.531 --> 01:44:16.772]  We wear shirts.
[01:44:16.772 --> 01:44:18.293]  We walk with banners.
[01:44:18.293 --> 01:44:23.516]  You do something with a message so that people can hear what you believe, and then you create change.
[01:44:23.516 --> 01:44:28.719]  But nobody's going to listen to anybody who's creating violence or creating havoc or just upset.
[01:44:28.719 --> 01:44:35.482]  They're just going to think that that person needs to be, you know, well, the average person I'm thinking here is what they think.
[01:44:35.482 --> 01:44:38.004]  That person needs to be, you know, beaten into submission.
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:43.088]  Surprisingly, that's almost always what happens in those kinds of situations.
[01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:46.072]  Well, they want a reason to let off rubber bullets.
[01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:48.814]  They want a reason to throw out the gas cans.
[01:44:48.814 --> 01:44:49.674]  And you're right.
[01:44:49.674 --> 01:45:00.661]  There are those people out there that have just awoken to the fact that this administration is evil, that they're liars, and they're ignorant to the other facts that previous administrations have been this evil.
[01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:01.762]  They've just been slicker.
[01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:03.783]  That it's not about Republican or Democrat.
[01:45:03.783 --> 01:45:05.745]  You know, they just know they're mad.
[01:45:05.745 --> 01:45:09.927]  And what they do is that, for instance, my buddy Nate out in Colorado, out in Portland, one of his good friends,
[01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:41.925]  I got this email he's like yeah I'm going to go recreate 68 and he brought that up with me he's like yeah he says he's going to this thing and I said you better warn him that this is going to be a provocative and I sent him the website with the shield and he's like oh my god you know this isn't the right thing so it's very easy for them to suck in the ignorant masses that just know that something's wrong and these people genuinely think they're doing something positive they're trying to bring change when in fact they're going to be just another part of this controlled paradigm
[01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:46.732]  In order to make movements like ours, Jonathan, look awful.
[01:45:46.732 --> 01:45:59.699]  Right, and they'll make us look violent, they'll make us look bad, and when peace protests break out in violence, I mean, this empowers the police state, and it's used as a pretext to further bolster imperialist philosophies.
[01:45:59.699 --> 01:46:03.281]  Peace organizations have worked so hard to curtail in our society.
[01:46:03.281 --> 01:46:08.624]  Our concern is legitimate that the DNC will be provoked towards violence.
[01:46:08.624 --> 01:46:09.144]  Our evidence
[01:46:09.873 --> 01:46:16.618]  The statements made by these organizations, their own website, past actions, and it's all presented in articles I released.
[01:46:16.618 --> 01:46:26.146]  I was attacked personally, almost immediately, for even having any dissent against these groups or having a different opinion.
[01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:39.296]  And I've had people confront me, and they've read the attack articles against me, and they're not familiar with my articles or my proof or my evidence, and they're like, oh, you know, I've heard this, that, and the other about you,
[01:46:39.881 --> 01:46:43.822]  You need to shut up and you need to stop talking about this.
[01:46:43.822 --> 01:46:54.124]  It's amazing because you can really see the power that the collective masses really have when they don't pay attention to what they're doing.
[01:46:54.124 --> 01:46:56.605]  The power of disinformation, Jonathan.
[01:46:56.605 --> 01:47:05.067]  Oh yeah, and it's almost kind of intimidating and scary at points because, you know, for a while there I was kind of rebuttaling
[01:47:05.871 --> 01:47:10.975]  Those attack articles, but they just kept coming and coming and emails kept coming and coming.
[01:47:10.975 --> 01:47:13.658]  So I decided to take the high road and just walk and say, you know what?
[01:47:13.658 --> 01:47:15.259]  Look, I said my piece.
[01:47:15.259 --> 01:47:16.440]  I blew the whistle.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.941]  This is not about me.
[01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:23.126]  This is about whether or not people understand my message, which is be peaceful.
[01:47:23.126 --> 01:47:25.108]  You know, let's, let's pull our heads together.
[01:47:25.108 --> 01:47:27.470]  Let's do something, you know, correct.
[01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:29.711]  I'm not against activism in any way.
[01:47:29.711 --> 01:47:31.393]  I'm an activist myself.
[01:47:31.393 --> 01:47:32.554]  I'm just concerned.
[01:47:32.895 --> 01:47:41.938]  For the safety of 9-11 truthers down there, I think that this is a great situation to make us look bad, and that's what I got when I went to the meetings.
[01:47:41.938 --> 01:47:49.060]  That's exactly what I felt, that's what I witnessed, and that's all I needed to back away from that group immediately.
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:49.840]  So, you know.
[01:47:50.578 --> 01:47:52.959]  That was just a sharing of my experience.
[01:47:52.959 --> 01:47:54.259]  No, you did the right thing.
[01:47:54.259 --> 01:47:57.540]  I mean you did the right thing and you exposed them and you're right.
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:01.741]  Look at the power of the mockingbirds, the people that aren't familiar with our information.
[01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:16.046]  They're not even going to take a look at the information and that's why the mainstream media has been somewhat successful in suppressing 9-11 truth because the majority of Fox News viewers don't know what 9-11 truth is, just what has been represented by those like
[01:48:16.525 --> 01:48:22.687]  Neil Cavuto and Bill O'Reilly and Sean Insanity and even Alan Combs.
[01:48:22.687 --> 01:48:24.228]  I'm not going to give him a pass.
[01:48:24.228 --> 01:48:30.310]  Just these talking heads and what they've said about 9-11 Truth, they're not actually going to go onto our website and check out our evidence.
[01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:35.052]  They're not going to go to Google Video and watch Loose Change Final Cut for free.
[01:48:35.052 --> 01:48:38.473]  We're putting this stuff out there for free to the masses because
[01:48:39.393 --> 01:48:40.994]  Our nation's on its last legs.
[01:48:40.994 --> 01:48:44.777]  If they carry out another false flag terror attack, God knows what they're going to do.
[01:48:44.777 --> 01:48:47.278]  The provisions for martial law are in place.
[01:48:47.278 --> 01:48:58.165]  In fact, a lot of people don't know this, Jonathan, but isn't it a fact that martial law was declared in Florida in the days before 9-11 when Jeb Bush was running that state?
[01:48:58.165 --> 01:49:04.329]  Yeah, four days before, if I'm not mistaken, he declares martial law.
[01:49:04.329 --> 01:49:05.170]  How convenient.
[01:49:06.095 --> 01:49:15.861]  And yeah, you know, and there was so much that came out of Florida that would have required the military to overrule the police in their investigations, you know, because I guess that was needed.
[01:49:15.861 --> 01:49:34.493]  I mean, come on, this guy... What's so funny about... What's so funny about declaring martial law in advance of 9-11 is all the evidence of all the whistleblowers that came out of Florida, all the FBI agents, all the people who knew, like, Hopsicker and stuff, who investigated Muhammad Atta,
[01:49:35.017 --> 01:49:45.900]  They knew almost immediately that there was going to be massive investigations into the many months, and I think over a year, spent by some of the hijackers in Florida.
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:54.702]  And had Jeb Bush not declared martial law, all that information would have came out because the press would have had carte blanche and went out and found out all this stuff.
[01:49:54.702 --> 01:49:59.123]  And once he declared martial law, well, that made it really easy for anyone who wanted to ask questions.
[01:49:59.123 --> 01:50:01.743]  They needed to be going to the military to get their answers.
[01:50:01.743 --> 01:50:04.364]  And we all know the military follows orders.
[01:50:06.213 --> 01:50:08.974]  I'm under national security special under martial law.
[01:50:08.974 --> 01:50:10.735]  Under martial law, anything goes.
[01:50:10.735 --> 01:50:15.516]  So, really that just meant that Jeff Bush is going to give you your information from now on.

[01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:07.728]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:07.728 --> 01:54:19.533]  I'm Jason Bermas, subbing in while Alex and the gang are down at Bilderberg, bringing you the news that matters, covering a conference that is going to determine what happens in this country over the next 12 months, and really around the world.
[01:54:19.533 --> 01:54:22.314]  It's going to be deciding a lot of our foreign and domestic policy.
[01:54:22.314 --> 01:54:23.795]  The media will not be covering this.
[01:54:24.475 --> 01:54:26.996]  They're going to act like it didn't even happen.
[01:54:26.996 --> 01:54:33.799]  And John Edwards, who has now been confronted about Bilderberg on several occasions, he says he was there for energy policy, this and that.
[01:54:33.799 --> 01:54:38.341]  The last time he was confronted, they asked him, well, why doesn't the media cover Bilderberg?
[01:54:38.341 --> 01:54:40.782]  And he said, you know, that's a good question.
[01:54:40.782 --> 01:54:42.163]  Typical politician answer.
[01:54:43.151 --> 01:54:49.656]  I just want to let everybody else know out there, with all the junk food we eat, it's important that we do our very best to take care of our digestive system.

[01:55:20.343 --> 01:55:23.644]  We're talking to Jonathan Elenoff of We Are Change Colorado and Truth Alliance.
[01:55:33.486 --> 01:55:35.307]  And Jonathan has done some great things.
[01:55:35.307 --> 01:55:40.229]  I mean, from the confrontations with Gary Hart to his articles about urban moving systems.
[01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:46.052]  This kid, I shouldn't call him a kid, he's a young man, just a little bit younger than myself, has done it all.
[01:55:46.052 --> 01:56:02.099]  And yesterday, I don't know if you were tuned in, Jonathan, but I went over some of your urban moving systems information and how one of these vans actually had exploded just down the road from the World Trade Center site somewhere on King Street between 6th and 7th Street.
[01:56:02.475 --> 01:56:11.419]  And that they were following a flatbed truck that had been rented to some Middle Easterners with the attacks actually painted as a mural on the truck.
[01:56:11.419 --> 01:56:13.140]  Amazing stuff!
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.380]  Yeah.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:21.223]  In the article, I kind of detailed that van with the mural on it, and it was.
[01:56:21.223 --> 01:56:28.267]  Even in the Saving City Lifeline, which was a transportation policy studies report released by Norman Mineta in 2006,
[01:56:29.525 --> 01:56:34.269]  He actually even confirmed that that van with the mural on it existed.
[01:56:34.269 --> 01:56:37.712]  And that report stated that there were continuing moments of alarm.
[01:56:37.712 --> 01:56:44.458]  A panel truck with a painting of a plane flying into the World Trade Center was stopped near the temporary command post.
[01:56:44.458 --> 01:56:49.081]  It proved to be rented to a group of ethnic Middle Eastern people who did not speak English.
[01:56:49.081 --> 01:56:56.848]  Fearing that it might be a truck bomb, the NYPD immediately evacuated the area, called out the bomb squad, and detained the occupants until a thorough search was made.
[01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:59.152]  And the vehicle was found to be a delivery truck.
[01:56:59.152 --> 01:57:05.217]  Now, that's taken directly from that report, and it was made available in the Vans article.
[01:57:05.217 --> 01:57:20.490]  So, you know, when I wrote that article, I was looking for any information on, okay, if Minetta says that there's Vans with explosives in it, and there's paintings of planes flying into the Trade Center towers, there's gotta be police reports out there.
[01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:25.194]  And luckily, someone a while back, I'm not sure how long ago, but somebody posted a
[01:57:26.118 --> 01:57:33.181]  Of all of the audio from the police radios that day that was released to the public in the fire department.
[01:57:33.181 --> 01:57:37.383]  There's actually a website that's dedicated to the fire department audio files.
[01:57:37.383 --> 01:57:46.107]  So I downloaded that and listened and listened for hours and I couldn't believe how many times I heard bans and stories about bans.
[01:57:46.107 --> 01:57:48.729]  And it was like, how come I've never heard about this?
[01:57:48.729 --> 01:57:52.350]  And the more I started looking into it, the more I actually started finding what I was looking for.
[01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:53.731]  It was just well buried.
[01:57:54.964 --> 01:58:00.968]  And this van is separate from the van that was pulled over by the George Washington Bridge that was supposedly full of explosives.
[01:58:00.968 --> 01:58:06.751]  The story then changes that it set off the dogs and there was no explosives in it, but it tested positive for explosives.
[01:58:06.751 --> 01:58:10.573]  We're going to get into that and more with Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado.
[01:58:10.573 --> 01:58:13.395]  After this, it is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com!

[02:00:10.021 --> 02:00:14.284]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen, on this Wednesday, June 4th, 2008.
[02:00:14.284 --> 02:00:20.288]  I am Jason Burma, subbing in for Alex Jones as he ventures in D.C.
[02:00:20.288 --> 02:00:21.529]  to the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:00:22.472 --> 02:00:27.694]  He's down in the hotel right now, in the Marriott, security everywhere, being followed.

[02:00:45.122 --> 02:00:49.484]  Just a ton of great stuff over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:49.484 --> 02:00:51.245]  Right now, I'm talking to Jonathan Ellenoth,
[02:00:51.906 --> 02:00:56.749]  of We Are Change Colorado, and we're discussing a lot of these vans now.
[02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:59.570]  These vans on 9-11, there was two big reports.
[02:00:59.570 --> 02:01:07.575]  There was the report of the one lined with explosives, and then there was the report of the three gentlemen who had taped the attack.
[02:01:07.575 --> 02:01:10.176]  And it looks like they were both detained.
[02:01:10.176 --> 02:01:19.782]  When you look at the report, some of these people who were involved in this quote-unquote Israeli intelligence ring were detained prior to 9-11, and even more were detained after 9-11.
[02:01:20.615 --> 02:01:35.284]  But they were all let go, and it seems like Urban Moving Systems, Amdocs, Converse, all this has gone by the wayside, and it's just not discussed at all, Jonathan, but now we find out there were even more vans and a suspicious mural-painted truck.
[02:01:35.284 --> 02:01:40.627]  Right, and the truck with the mural on it was described as a moving truck.
[02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:48.031]  Some have suggested that it might be the same van that was owned by Urban Moving Systems, but another owned multiple vans.
[02:01:48.031 --> 02:01:49.212]  That hasn't been confirmed,
[02:01:49.633 --> 02:01:55.797]  But that's something I'd like to ask Dominic Souter, who was the, uh, the, that he was the owner of the Urban Moving Systems.
[02:01:55.797 --> 02:02:01.240]  He employed these guys that were celebrating the attacks on New York and filming them.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:03.401]  Um, and those names were released.
[02:02:03.401 --> 02:02:05.442]  We have those names of those guys.
[02:02:05.442 --> 02:02:12.506]  So, you know, I have a, I have a film coming out, as you know, that's going to be, which it's going to be detailing all of this information.
[02:02:12.506 --> 02:02:17.429]  And of course, some new footage of Building 7 and some other interviews that people haven't seen yet.
[02:02:17.429 --> 02:02:18.950]  And, uh, hopefully we can, uh,
[02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:45.080]  Really get some questions answered because I mean anybody who's driving around on 9-11 with a van with a mural on it basically showing what's going on that day should be questioned I mean to say the least and why we know nothing about this I mean just only raises my curiosity and I'm sure there's a long list of questions we all want to ask them but yeah at the police radio they even reported a couple of
[02:02:46.099 --> 02:02:48.840]  Uh, times that a truck had actually exploded.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.861]  One van had actually already blown up.
[02:02:50.861 --> 02:02:57.283]  And I was able to determine that actually the FBI, originally on that day for a short period, was releasing statements.
[02:02:57.283 --> 02:03:12.189]  Now, I found USA Today, MSNBC, and CNN all releasing this, that they believed that there was a car or truck that was in the basement in the parking garage that had also exploded, um, aside from the explosives heard in the building and the plane hitting it.
[02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:14.550]  So the FBI at one point actually confirmed
[02:03:15.086 --> 02:03:17.727]  This story, um, to be legitimate.
[02:03:17.727 --> 02:03:20.288]  They said it was the working theory at the time.
[02:03:20.288 --> 02:03:20.628]  Right.
[02:03:20.628 --> 02:03:22.009]  Exactly.
[02:03:22.009 --> 02:03:29.732]  So, uh, so I'm, you know, we're not alone in this, that these vans were, uh, you know, people were conscious of these vans.
[02:03:29.732 --> 02:03:37.155]  So I want to know why the FBI released that report, what information they were going on because they haven't released their intel and, uh, why they changed it.
[02:03:37.155 --> 02:03:38.796]  So suddenly who made that decision?
[02:03:38.796 --> 02:03:43.418]  I mean, if it's, this is a, an issue of orders, somebody needs to be held accountable, but,
[02:03:43.877 --> 02:03:52.141]  The direction was changed deliberately that day, away from these vans, so that we would basically avoid hearing about them.
[02:03:52.141 --> 02:04:10.009]  And you can kind of, as you watch, you've seen all the footage, so you know, as you watch the day unfold throughout 9-11, you can see the direction of the media, which is, for the most part, looking at it as, you know, they're looking for bombs, they're looking for explosives, these vans are an interesting story.
[02:04:10.009 --> 02:04:11.510]  Dan Rather covers it at one point.
[02:04:11.997 --> 02:04:18.301]  CNN covers it a little bit later in the evening, and then all of a sudden, just an immediate change, a 180.
[02:04:18.301 --> 02:04:22.584]  And some news reports are saying the exact opposite information.
[02:04:22.584 --> 02:04:26.527]  Absolutely, you know, and on that day, they're blaming Bin Laden all over the place.
[02:04:26.527 --> 02:04:31.490]  Every mainstream network I know, Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Bin Laden, we already know it's Bin Laden!
[02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:36.113]  Well, we'll be back after this with Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado.
[02:04:36.113 --> 02:04:37.274]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:48.257 --> 02:04:50.218]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:50.218 --> 02:04:53.841]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:53.841 --> 02:04:55.722]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:55.722 --> 02:04:59.325]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:05.069]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:08.972]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:09.312 --> 02:05:14.517]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:05:14.517 --> 02:05:17.559]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:05:17.559 --> 02:05:24.786]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[02:05:24.786 --> 02:05:30.771]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:05:30.771 --> 02:05:35.275]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:05:35.575 --> 02:05:38.438]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:05:38.438 --> 02:05:40.481]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:40.481 --> 02:05:42.463]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:05:42.463 --> 02:05:44.605]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:05:44.605 --> 02:05:46.387]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:05:46.387 --> 02:05:47.108]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:05:48.547 --> 02:05:57.470]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:05:57.470 --> 02:06:02.612]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:06:02.612 --> 02:06:13.736]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:06:14.136 --> 02:06:19.920]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:26.185]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:06:26.185 --> 02:06:27.225]  What about you?

[02:06:48.092 --> 02:06:52.594]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:06:52.594 --> 02:06:57.696]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:06:57.696 --> 02:06:59.217]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:59.217 --> 02:07:02.819]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:07:02.819 --> 02:07:08.221]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[02:07:14.344 --> 02:07:16.846]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:07:16.846 --> 02:07:19.388]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:24.191]  No animal testing.
[02:07:24.191 --> 02:07:25.532]  I use them and love them.
[02:07:25.532 --> 02:07:27.413]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[02:07:27.413 --> 02:07:28.814]  And I say big time.
[02:07:28.814 --> 02:07:30.295]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.

[02:07:40.322 --> 02:07:49.509]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:07:49.509 --> 02:07:56.135]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:56.135 --> 02:07:59.117]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:04.514 --> 02:08:07.216]  All right, folks, we are back.
[02:08:07.216 --> 02:08:10.438]  Alex Jones, Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:08:10.438 --> 02:08:11.638]  The Bilderberg meeting.
[02:08:11.638 --> 02:08:14.080]  He's gonna be popping in, hopefully, in the third hour.
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:16.101]  We're also gonna be taking your calls.
[02:08:16.101 --> 02:08:21.945]  In the third hour, right now, we have Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado.
[02:08:21.945 --> 02:08:24.707]  And, Jonathan, you've been in this for quite some time.
[02:08:24.707 --> 02:08:28.609]  You know, the anti-globalist movement, the anti-New World Order movement.
[02:08:29.503 --> 02:08:39.130]  When did you decide that, hey, Colorado needs a chapter of We Are Change and I'm going to be the guy, I'm going to be the go-to guy, I'm going to put this thing together?
[02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:56.022]  Um, well actually, I originally had just kind of been dabbing around in the local 9-11 visibility group here under Michael Wolsey and the Colorado 9-11 visibility group, which is a great group, a bunch of great people there, nice people.
[02:08:56.022 --> 02:08:58.023]  And it was through that
[02:08:58.733 --> 02:09:02.496]  Uh, that I had met, uh, Jason Charles, a true client.
[02:09:02.496 --> 02:09:10.321]  And, uh, we got a chance to meet up with Rob and Josh and Nick and Adam and Shannon and all the other founders of We Are Change Colorado.
[02:09:10.321 --> 02:09:15.005]  And basically, they had this vision of bringing We Are Change to Colorado.
[02:09:15.005 --> 02:09:27.634]  And I just, uh, it was, it just kind of manifested, you know, and, uh, it, with the help and the great work of these, uh, these people out here in Colorado, uh, the ones, the names I just mentioned, uh, we made it happen.
[02:09:29.297 --> 02:09:36.623]  I'm just so honored to know these guys and to be on the battle lines with them.
[02:09:36.623 --> 02:09:42.647]  I didn't really ever see myself as becoming a hardcore activist when I was younger.
[02:09:42.647 --> 02:09:52.494]  I did know that I would inevitably fight for what I believed in because growing up, I was into this stuff in the 90s.
[02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:56.331]  Uh, conspiracy books and stuff like that.
[02:09:56.331 --> 02:10:01.492]  I used to read, you know, people like David Icke, who is not popular by any means in this movement.
[02:10:01.492 --> 02:10:04.753]  And, uh, he was actually one of the people who turned me on to this stuff.
[02:10:04.753 --> 02:10:13.415]  And I came across Alex Jones, and then I just basically immediately was just completely behind the movement and total support.
[02:10:13.415 --> 02:10:15.155]  Of course, I worked all the time.
[02:10:15.155 --> 02:10:21.757]  So I always knew that my place in this battlefield, which was to fight on the side of truth,
[02:10:22.301 --> 02:10:32.183]  Well, I feel like all of us have a place on this battlefield who crave freedom, who crave the Bill of Rights and Constitution, who want a government for and by the people again.
[02:10:32.183 --> 02:10:38.025]  Those are the people that need to wake up, and people need to realize you do have power.
[02:10:38.025 --> 02:10:40.646]  We are all very powerful beings.
[02:10:40.646 --> 02:10:45.727]  You know, Jonathan has been able to confront some of the bigwigs on this, most notably Gary Hart.
[02:10:45.727 --> 02:10:48.747]  That's probably my favorite one from We Are Change Colorado, but that's not it.
[02:10:48.747 --> 02:10:50.768]  I mean, you've gone much further than that, haven't you, Jonathan?
[02:10:51.798 --> 02:10:53.859]  Oh yeah, we've gotten Bill Clinton.
[02:10:53.859 --> 02:10:57.041]  We got national press coverage for our confrontation with Bill Clinton.
[02:10:57.041 --> 02:10:59.583]  We just recently confronted McCain.
[02:10:59.583 --> 02:11:04.145]  Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to have a video on that.
[02:11:04.145 --> 02:11:06.667]  I did talk to the person who had camera footage.
[02:11:06.667 --> 02:11:07.808]  We have some of the speech.
[02:11:07.808 --> 02:11:10.609]  I don't think we have anything of anything else.
[02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:15.232]  But we did also, we just confronted the Denver Water Board again on water fluoridation.
[02:11:15.232 --> 02:11:19.855]  And actually, we were attacked by some private attorney who showed up and declared us
[02:11:21.182 --> 02:11:24.305]  Uh, a crazy conspiracy theorist that was actually entertaining.
[02:11:24.305 --> 02:11:25.646]  That video will be up shortly.
[02:11:25.646 --> 02:11:28.868]  Uh, which actually, it kind of brings me to a whole other point.
[02:11:28.868 --> 02:11:33.632]  My YouTube channel had been, uh, disabled a while back, about a month back.
[02:11:33.632 --> 02:11:38.556]  And, uh, I'm, I've been permanently banned from YouTube for some, uh, convenient reason.
[02:11:38.556 --> 02:11:43.020]  So, uh, we've had to resort to relying to friends and other people to post our videos.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.623]  So, um, if people are wondering why they haven't been able to see our videos in a while, that's, uh,
[02:11:47.202 --> 02:11:48.983]  That's the reason why.
[02:11:48.983 --> 02:12:07.468]  Well, you gotta understand, these people are going to combat us in every way possible, and I truly believe the reshaping of Google Video, for instance, was in large part to the popularity of movies like Loose Change and Zeitgeist and other patriot films like America, Freedom to Fascism, where they used to have a top 100 on the front page.
[02:12:07.468 --> 02:12:09.489]  It was very easily navigable.
[02:12:09.489 --> 02:12:12.690]  People could look at the views that were on there,
[02:12:13.277 --> 02:12:21.844]  And then we got a little too popular and they started resetting our views and they started taking us off the top 100 and then they started taking out embed as an option.
[02:12:21.844 --> 02:12:27.208]  And now they show you the top 10 or 15 videos in a specialized location.
[02:12:27.208 --> 02:12:29.110]  They don't show you how many views there are.
[02:12:29.110 --> 02:12:31.732]  They won't allow you to embed new videos.
[02:12:31.732 --> 02:12:41.220]  It seems like they're controlling this paradigm on the internet a little bit more strongly because it was able to infiltrate the mainstream because
[02:12:41.641 --> 02:12:41.721]  It's
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:11.469]  The fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, where he showed the handlebars video, and they didn't just tell him to take that down, they just deleted his entire account without any, uh, any notification whatsoever, and they said it was due to that video.
[02:13:11.469 --> 02:13:13.030]  But, really, that's fair use.
[02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:15.031]  I mean, Alex had them on the show.
[02:13:15.031 --> 02:13:17.273]  You know, he has a small little TV program.
[02:13:17.273 --> 02:13:23.457]  That's like taking, uh, fuse off the air, because they did an interview with these guys and showed a portion of the video.
[02:13:23.457 --> 02:13:24.558]  It's absolutely ludicrous.
[02:13:25.185 --> 02:13:26.606]  Yeah, that is ludicrous.
[02:13:26.606 --> 02:13:27.687]  It's ridiculous.
[02:13:27.687 --> 02:13:31.849]  That's exactly what I had experienced.
[02:13:31.849 --> 02:13:41.836]  It's been fun confronting... I mean, we've confronted people like Giuliani, Romney, Ashcroft, and all these videos are basically off of YouTube right now.
[02:13:41.836 --> 02:13:42.836]  We do still have them.
[02:13:42.836 --> 02:13:44.818]  We are going to get them back up.
[02:13:44.818 --> 02:13:47.119]  And I'm showing some of them in my film.
[02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:54.704]  But, you know, this whole battle, which is basically an internet war of information because
[02:13:55.222 --> 02:14:04.908]  I mean, let's face it, 90% of the people in this movement have found out about this, either from a DVD that somebody handed them, or a website that somebody sent them to, or that they ended up on.
[02:14:04.908 --> 02:14:08.611]  So this, and those DVDs, by the way, come from ordering them on the Internet.
[02:14:08.611 --> 02:14:11.452]  You're not getting them in Barnes & Noble.
[02:14:11.452 --> 02:14:14.935]  You're not buying them, you know, you're not renting them at Blockbuster.
[02:14:14.935 --> 02:14:24.641]  This movement is solely dependent on communication between the Internet and cell phone, and it's grown to such a substantial size now
[02:14:25.205 --> 02:14:31.788]  That, um, really the only thing they can do is try to attack us through the internet, which is funny that that's where we're in the battle.
[02:14:31.788 --> 02:14:41.773]  So I'm not surprised one bit when I see this stuff, uh, you know, manifest before our eyes on the internet because, for example, I see disinformation all the time on the internet.
[02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:52.439]  It's one of the great tragedies of, um, of this movement, which is that, um, you know, the people who know the information get basically
[02:14:53.295 --> 02:14:55.676]  Um, censored and moved aside.
[02:14:55.676 --> 02:15:03.158]  And then at the forefront, I see videos with tons of hits on YouTube that are complete disinformation.
[02:15:03.158 --> 02:15:04.239]  I've seen it all the time.
[02:15:04.239 --> 02:15:19.964]  Uh, I'm not going to name names, but, uh, I'm sure you're familiar with this and it's... Sure, it's the, it's the laser beam, no plain whack job crowd that wants to put out a thousand videos and, you know, claim that we're somehow censoring their ludicrousy.
[02:15:19.964 --> 02:15:20.324]  And, uh,
[02:15:21.055 --> 02:15:25.856]  You know, imagination, because there's no evidence to support any of this stuff.
[02:15:25.856 --> 02:15:35.199]  Listen, overlaying videos on top of videos that are shot at different angles, on different cameras, with different lenses, guess what?
[02:15:35.199 --> 02:15:37.059]  You're going to yield different results.
[02:15:37.059 --> 02:15:39.100]  They're not going to just line up.
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:43.261]  This isn't Fantasyland, where everything just overlays.
[02:15:43.261 --> 02:15:48.262]  I mean, it's so obvious to me that this stuff is disinfo, and it makes me sick, because
[02:15:49.025 --> 02:15:57.429]  Uh, you know, for instance, Howard Stern, you know, he has Paula Gloria on his show for an hour long and she sounds completely and totally insane.
[02:15:57.429 --> 02:16:08.714]  And when she brings up something like, uh, you know, somebody who was waving in the impact hole, instead of explaining why that would be impossible for the official version, she goes, Oh, well, just think about it.
[02:16:08.714 --> 02:16:16.058]  Well, no, what you need to say, you know, if you have any sort of legitimacy whatsoever is, well, the official version is that the impact site
[02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:34.076]  It's supposed to be between 1,500 and 1,800 degrees to weaken this steel, yet we have people in the impact holes waving, and we also have the, not the transcripts, not only the transcripts, but the audio of the firefighters who are in the impact hole saying they can knock down the fire with two hand lines.
[02:16:34.076 --> 02:16:35.616]  Okay, now think to yourself.
[02:16:35.616 --> 02:16:38.537]  If it was 1,500 degrees, could a person stand there?
[02:16:38.537 --> 02:16:39.117]  No.
[02:16:39.117 --> 02:16:41.537]  If it was 1,200 degrees, could a person stand there?
[02:16:41.537 --> 02:16:42.118]  No.
[02:16:42.118 --> 02:16:42.778]  If it was 600 degrees,
[02:16:43.936 --> 02:16:45.137]  Could a person stand there?
[02:16:45.137 --> 02:16:46.278]  The answer is no.
[02:16:46.278 --> 02:16:48.179]  That's like getting into a broiler.
[02:16:48.179 --> 02:16:49.560]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:51.141]  And that's the point that needs to be made.
[02:16:51.141 --> 02:16:58.407]  And instead, they have coop jobs on there talking about no planes and plane-hugging pedophiles.
[02:16:58.407 --> 02:17:00.168]  Just nonsense, you know?
[02:17:00.168 --> 02:17:01.669]  And it makes me sick.
[02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:03.590]  But at the same time, you've got to realize...
[02:17:04.744 --> 02:17:05.785]  What's that?
[02:17:05.785 --> 02:17:07.586]  And those videos don't get pulled.
[02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:13.190]  Oh no, those videos are going to be, not only do they not get pulled, they get promoted by the mainstream.
[02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:17.673]  The mainstream can't wait to say something like, no planes hit the towers.
[02:17:17.673 --> 02:17:23.737]  You know, I'll never forget when Morgan Reynolds went on Fox News and said, well, they're cartoons.
[02:17:23.737 --> 02:17:26.259]  And I'm thinking to myself, all right, you're disinfo.
[02:17:26.259 --> 02:17:29.421]  You know, this former Bush official, I had done an interview with him.
[02:17:29.421 --> 02:17:29.641]  He had,
[02:17:30.322 --> 02:17:32.263]  He had really given some signs in that interview.
[02:17:32.263 --> 02:17:41.147]  I actually had done that interview with Alex and some of the crew over at InfoWars and he went off this tangent on OJ where he's doing the slashing and stabbing.
[02:17:41.147 --> 02:17:43.908]  And he had just grown this big weird mustache.
[02:17:43.908 --> 02:17:44.348]  And I'm like...
[02:17:45.083 --> 02:17:46.304]  What is this guy doing?
[02:17:46.304 --> 02:17:50.888]  And then he jumps into the Looney Bin crowd about cartoon planes.
[02:17:50.888 --> 02:17:53.791]  Listen, those people don't even know how special effects work.
[02:17:53.791 --> 02:17:56.033]  They don't know what a chroma key is.
[02:17:56.033 --> 02:18:06.803]  They, they, you know, from all the nonsense about Wes Cam and this and that and projecting and, you know, Rick Siegel with his garbage on his, on his update of 9-11 Eyewitness.
[02:18:06.803 --> 02:18:08.565]  Look, I don't need these guys as friends.
[02:18:08.565 --> 02:18:10.607]  You know, I don't need these guys representing this movement.
[02:18:10.607 --> 02:18:11.908]  They're tearing this movement apart.
[02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:14.811]  And they're the first ones to attack people.
[02:18:14.811 --> 02:18:21.935]  I shouldn't even be giving them, uh, you know, this much of a forum, but people need to be aware that they're, that those videos aren't going to be pulled.
[02:18:21.935 --> 02:18:23.677]  Those videos are going to be promoted.
[02:18:23.677 --> 02:18:28.600]  Those videos are, are out there to try to discredit the entire movement and make us look all nuts.
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:41.829]  So when, you know, Jesse Ventura gets on Howard Stern and starts talking about, you know, the demolitions of one, two and seven and how he was in the, you know, underwater Navy demolitions team and he knows what a demolition looks like, they try to poo poo him.
[02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:46.674]  You know, or when Rosie O'Donnell was on there yesterday in an unprecedented event.
[02:18:46.674 --> 02:18:48.295]  Did you hear that yet?
[02:18:48.295 --> 02:18:48.916]  No.
[02:18:48.916 --> 02:18:52.779]  Yeah, she called in and she's been dogged on that show for 15-20 years.
[02:18:52.779 --> 02:18:55.261]  I mean, like seriously, dogged out on that show.
[02:18:55.261 --> 02:18:58.524]  As soon as she had that Rosie O'Donnell show, they've been all over her.
[02:18:58.524 --> 02:19:01.046]  And she actually called in for the first time.
[02:19:01.046 --> 02:19:03.869]  And this just shows what the awareness is.
[02:19:03.869 --> 02:19:05.810]  You know, Stern gets a ton of emails about 9-11 Truth.
[02:19:06.963 --> 02:19:14.667]  So he's well aware that Rosie O'Donnell has questioned the official version, and we played the clip yesterday, and she brought up, you know, 1, 2, 7.
[02:19:14.667 --> 02:19:19.190]  She said that, you know, you should have Willie Rodriguez on there, explained his story.
[02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:22.511]  Stern promised to have Rodriguez on, so we will see.
[02:19:22.511 --> 02:19:25.533]  Let's take some calls in the next segment, Jonathan, before I let you go.
[02:19:25.533 --> 02:19:29.015]  And, uh, and then we're gonna take calls in the final hour.
[02:19:29.015 --> 02:19:30.276]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:30.276 --> 02:19:32.357]  I am Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com.
[02:19:48.979 --> 02:19:50.399]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:50.399 --> 02:19:53.200]  A New World Order.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:58.102]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:58.102 --> 02:20:00.923]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:00.923 --> 02:20:03.724]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:03.724 --> 02:20:06.905]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.905 --> 02:20:14.207]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:17.252 --> 02:20:22.697]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.697 --> 02:20:26.580]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:29.142]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:29.142 --> 02:20:30.303]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:30.303 --> 02:20:31.084]  They're not after money.
[02:20:31.084 --> 02:20:32.365]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.365 --> 02:20:33.126]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.126 --> 02:20:34.507]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:20:43.234 --> 02:20:43.995]  In Game.
[02:20:43.995 --> 02:20:45.496]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:20:45.996 --> 02:20:49.399]  You have been warned.
[02:20:49.399 --> 02:20:51.100]  Ted Anderson from Midas, June 4th, 2008.
[02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:53.862]  Gold 883.50 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $909.33, $447.95 for half, $223.98 for quarter.
[02:20:53.862 --> 02:20:54.323]  That's $909.33, $447.95, and $223.98.
[02:21:05.933 --> 02:21:09.615]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:21:09.615 --> 02:21:12.736]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:21:12.736 --> 02:21:22.221]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[02:21:22.221 --> 02:21:27.544]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:21:28.024 --> 02:21:30.385]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:21:30.385 --> 02:21:33.225]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[02:21:34.946 --> 02:21:36.886]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[02:21:36.886 --> 02:21:37.667]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:37.667 --> 02:21:38.207]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.813 --> 02:21:53.337]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:21:53.337 --> 02:21:58.360]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:04.545]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[02:22:04.545 --> 02:22:09.008]  We promote a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.

[02:22:48.345 --> 02:22:51.608]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:22:51.608 --> 02:22:54.992]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:22:54.992 --> 02:23:05.923]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech?
[02:23:06.678 --> 02:23:12.082]  Freedom of religion and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[02:23:12.082 --> 02:23:18.127]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:23:18.127 --> 02:23:26.033]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:23:27.074 --> 02:23:27.595]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:23:27.595 --> 02:23:27.955]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:23:27.955 --> 02:23:29.377]  The call is free.
[02:23:29.377 --> 02:23:33.722]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:23:49.099 --> 02:23:54.923]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:54.923 --> 02:23:57.204]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:19.608 --> 02:24:22.850]  With us, I want to remind people the InfoWars Money Bomb was a great success.
[02:24:22.850 --> 02:24:24.691]  We raised over $200,000.
[02:24:24.691 --> 02:24:26.491]  We're keeping it open until the end of the week.
[02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:40.899]  And on Friday, we're going to unveil the actual number, the final number, of what we made so we can put this together, put this new television network together, this new show together, move into bigger offices and expand the operation.
[02:24:40.899 --> 02:24:43.220]  That being said, let's go to our first caller.
[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:44.981]  Scott, you're live in Colorado.
[02:24:44.981 --> 02:24:46.542]  Scott, are you with us?
[02:24:46.542 --> 02:24:47.102]  Hey, Jason.
[02:24:47.102 --> 02:24:47.842]  How are you doing?
[02:24:47.842 --> 02:24:48.002]  Good.
[02:24:49.912 --> 02:24:53.555]  This might be a little premature on my end here.
[02:24:53.555 --> 02:25:09.507]  I just added something to YouTube in reference to a church here in Colorado Springs that had a sign out front that basically looked to me like one of the ministers was
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:13.523]  Going to be preaching on Romans 13.
[02:25:13.523 --> 02:25:17.425]  Give up your guns, obey the government, it's God, go to the camps.
[02:25:17.425 --> 02:25:18.586]  Exactly.
[02:25:18.586 --> 02:25:21.448]  Anyway, it might not be up yet on YouTube.
[02:25:21.448 --> 02:25:28.234]  I've put it up, but I can't get it to pull up via the search words.
[02:25:28.234 --> 02:25:33.097]  But it's listed under Freedom Church, Colorado Springs.
[02:25:33.097 --> 02:25:35.959]  So it'll come up, you know, eventually today.
[02:25:35.959 --> 02:25:36.800]  I don't know what they're doing.
[02:25:37.113 --> 02:25:46.620]  If I go into my own account, I can see it, but it won't pull it up under the... Well, definitely let us know, and shoot an email over to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:49.021]  Maybe we can do a story on it, if not this week.
[02:25:49.021 --> 02:25:50.563]  Next week, I thank you for the call, Scott.
[02:25:50.563 --> 02:25:53.585]  Let's go to DJ in Florida.
[02:25:53.585 --> 02:25:54.786]  DJ, are you with us?
[02:25:54.786 --> 02:25:55.926]  Yeah, hey, I'm right here.
[02:25:55.926 --> 02:26:05.213]  Hey, lookit, on your film, your latest film, you had the corner of the American Express building with 300-ton pieces of steel in it.
[02:26:05.433 --> 02:26:05.874]  Sure thing.
[02:26:05.874 --> 02:26:07.917]  I think it was, what, 20 stories up?
[02:26:07.917 --> 02:26:08.658]  Yep.
[02:26:08.658 --> 02:26:12.764]  Okay, have you, has anybody got any films of taking that out of that?
[02:26:12.764 --> 02:26:21.496]  That was, you know, I showed that just a special sequence to a lot of people that had more impact than the planes hitting the towers.
[02:26:22.054 --> 02:26:27.257]  It's pretty wild stuff that it was actually been able to thrown that far in a supposed... 400 feet!
[02:26:27.257 --> 02:26:33.020]  Yeah, at about, you know, in a supposed pancake collapse and embed itself into the side of this building.
[02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:34.521]  I'm not sure how they got that out.
[02:26:34.521 --> 02:26:37.323]  Jonathan, do you know how they got that out?
[02:26:37.323 --> 02:26:42.746]  Uh, you know, I've got a video from Steven Rosenbaum that shows the cranes pulling that out.
[02:26:42.746 --> 02:26:47.128]  I believe they actually had to build a crane, uh, just for a construction site.
[02:26:47.128 --> 02:26:50.250]  They had to build up the crane and then they had to actually maneuver it out of there.
[02:26:50.802 --> 02:26:53.264]  Well, what a selling point that is!
[02:26:53.264 --> 02:26:54.225]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:54.225 --> 02:26:55.786]  I mean... I mean, that's dynamite!
[02:26:55.786 --> 02:27:03.052]  I think so too, but it's just one of the hundreds of points that we make in Loose Change Final Cut, and if you guys haven't seen it, you know, it's for free on Google Video.
[02:27:03.052 --> 02:27:05.394]  DJ, I thank you for the call.
[02:27:05.394 --> 02:27:16.403]  You know, yeah, again, you know, you have this huge beam embedded 400 feet away from the World Trade Center into a building around the 20th floor, and they have to build a special apparatus to take it out.
[02:27:16.403 --> 02:27:18.564]  Let's go to Betty in North Carolina.
[02:27:18.564 --> 02:27:19.765]  Betty, are you with us?
[02:27:19.765 --> 02:27:20.286]  Yes, I am.
[02:27:21.497 --> 02:27:22.217]  Hi, Jason.
[02:27:22.217 --> 02:27:24.679]  This is my first time calling in.
[02:27:24.679 --> 02:27:26.159]  Excellent.
[02:27:26.159 --> 02:27:37.345]  I've listened to Alex Jones' show now for over a year, and I was on vacation last April, and a guy from Tennessee was telling me about it, so that's how I know.
[02:27:37.345 --> 02:27:50.031]  And I wanted to let you know that last year, September, I took my cat into the vets to get checked up, and there they asked me if I wanted to get her microchipped.
[02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:52.070]  It was a new thing, huh?
[02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:53.231]  You hadn't heard about that.
[02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:54.873]  Yeah, pretty wild, right?
[02:27:54.873 --> 02:27:56.914]  Right, and I told him, no way.
[02:27:56.914 --> 02:28:06.783]  Now, my question is, say if someone has to go into the hospital for, like, surgery, operation, can they microchip somebody without their consent?
[02:28:07.501 --> 02:28:10.144]  I don't know if they can do it without their consent yet.
[02:28:10.144 --> 02:28:14.388]  The only ones that I can say that they can do it without their consent are military personnel.
[02:28:14.388 --> 02:28:15.529]  Basically, you don't have a choice.
[02:28:15.529 --> 02:28:21.315]  You either leave the military and be court-martialed and go to military prison or you have to take it.
[02:28:21.315 --> 02:28:24.759]  That's why earlier I was reading that article how they had banned employers
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:30.726]  from forcing people in Missouri to take the chip because this is a new popular thing.
[02:28:30.726 --> 02:28:38.936]  I suggest that you get on the internet, you go to YouTube, you type in Verichip, actually if you go to my blog loosechange911.com, one of my really early blogs,
[02:28:39.471 --> 02:28:53.894]  From, I believe, March or early April, I have about five or six videos of how far the chip has come, how it's being proposed by the Mexican government to chip all illegal aliens, in other words, people who are from Guatemala and below, to come into the country.
[02:28:53.894 --> 02:28:56.535]  Instead of a passport, they want to chip these people.
[02:28:56.535 --> 02:28:57.635]  Betty, I thank you for the call.
[02:28:57.635 --> 02:29:04.117]  Yeah, this is a brave new world, Jonathan, where they literally want to chip not just your pet, but human beings.
[02:29:04.117 --> 02:29:05.877]  Oh yeah, and I was going to say that
[02:29:06.673 --> 02:29:10.495]  You know, they're chipping people without their consent in other countries.
[02:29:10.495 --> 02:29:12.897]  There's reports of that already coming out.
[02:29:12.897 --> 02:29:18.240]  If it's happening in the states, it would be happening against, you know, laws and stuff.
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:22.323]  But, you know, remember, people can be bought to do whatever they want, so I wouldn't put it past anybody.
[02:29:22.323 --> 02:29:22.783]  That's right.
[02:29:22.783 --> 02:29:23.924]  Jonathan, thank you so much.
[02:29:23.924 --> 02:29:26.405]  We are Change Colorado.
[02:29:26.405 --> 02:29:27.306]  Just a great group.
[02:29:27.306 --> 02:29:28.627]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:28.627 --> 02:29:29.507]  I'm Jason Bermas.

[02:29:38.686 --> 02:29:41.669]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:30:23.152 --> 02:30:23.552]  I think so.
[02:30:48.908 --> 02:30:51.769]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:30:51.769 --> 02:30:53.330]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:30:53.330 --> 02:30:55.491]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:30:55.491 --> 02:30:57.392]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:30:57.392 --> 02:30:58.893]  The late great USA.
[02:30:58.893 --> 02:31:00.634]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:31:48.643 --> 02:31:52.466]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:31:52.466 --> 02:31:56.589]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:31:56.589 --> 02:32:03.414]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:06.296]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:32:06.696 --> 02:32:16.100]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:20.741]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:32:20.741 --> 02:32:23.863]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:32:23.863 --> 02:32:29.965]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[02:32:30.305 --> 02:32:30.786]  We're good to go!
[02:32:55.475 --> 02:33:16.090]  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before Look at the hate we're breeding
[02:33:25.939 --> 02:33:45.236]  Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before Alright folks, we are back.
[02:33:45.236 --> 02:33:46.517]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:47.390 --> 02:33:50.753]  Alex, of course, in Chantilly, Virginia at the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:33:50.753 --> 02:33:53.095]  Hopefully he'll be checking in in the next hour.
[02:33:53.095 --> 02:34:00.822]  If you missed any of the first hour with Alex and Jim Tucker, we'll be replaying that on a loop over at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:00.822 --> 02:34:02.244]  But now we have a real treat for you.
[02:34:02.244 --> 02:34:03.565]  We have Daniel Estillan.
[02:34:04.005 --> 02:34:09.130]  Who is a best-selling international author about the Bilderberg Group, the true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:11.653]  You can get that over at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:11.653 --> 02:34:18.759]  And he's heavily featured in Alex Jones's documentary, Endgame, also available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:18.759 --> 02:34:20.481]  We've got him for the next 30 minutes.
[02:34:20.481 --> 02:34:21.222]  Daniel, how are you?
[02:34:22.850 --> 02:34:23.750]  I'm very well, thank you.
[02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:31.912]  I might sound unfortunate that I can't attend this year's Bill of Rights conference because, as a matter of fact, I was told by friends in the United States to stay away and stay out.
[02:34:31.912 --> 02:34:45.415]  Apparently, the Homeland Security, your Homeland Security, was preparing quite a welcome party for me and we just all felt it would be better for me to stay away and to let Alex and Big Jim Tucker to take care of it on the
[02:34:46.235 --> 02:34:54.450]  Right there in CETO now of course have all the access to information through our sources at the Deliveroo conference as it is taking place as we speak.
[02:34:55.205 --> 02:34:59.328]  Yeah, and you know, this is the first time it's been in Chantilly, Virginia since 2002.
[02:34:59.328 --> 02:35:03.911]  And in 2002, I believe that was the first Bilderberg meeting after 9-11.
[02:35:03.911 --> 02:35:08.675]  This is where they set the policy to go into Iraq in 2003.
[02:35:08.675 --> 02:35:18.782]  And I made the point earlier that by having it in Washington, D.C., it gives them a lot more access to military personnel, Washington insiders and bureaucrats within the system.
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:24.638]  To stop by just for maybe a short conference or a short meeting and not have to attend the entire weekend.
[02:35:24.638 --> 02:35:25.160]  What do you think?
[02:35:26.516 --> 02:35:39.623]  Well, actually, the way it usually works, and I do have access to the documents which I publish, some of these documents, internal Bill O'Berger documents, in my book, The True Story of the Bill O'Berger Group, the people who attend, they're required to stay for the entire weekend.
[02:35:39.623 --> 02:35:55.031]  It was an exception in 2002 when the former Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld, was invited, was told, made to appear, and literally at the biggest spat of the Bill O'Bergers, the European and the American delegations,
[02:35:55.291 --> 02:35:56.012]  We're good to go.
[02:36:15.746 --> 02:36:16.146]  We're good.
[02:36:36.775 --> 02:36:38.496]  So what do you think is on the agenda this year?
[02:36:38.496 --> 02:36:43.999]  Obviously we have, you know, the presidential race over in the United States.
[02:36:43.999 --> 02:36:47.061]  We have the invasion of Iran on the table.
[02:36:47.061 --> 02:36:50.103]  We have skyrocketing gas prices.
[02:36:50.103 --> 02:36:53.725]  We even have food rationing going on now in this country in New York.
[02:36:53.725 --> 02:36:58.468]  You know, they're limiting the amount of rice and wheat that you can buy in certain stores.
[02:36:58.468 --> 02:37:02.230]  Are these going to be the topics they're discussing or am I missing something?
[02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.730]  What do you think?
[02:37:02.890 --> 02:37:04.891]  You know what, you pretty much are.
[02:37:04.891 --> 02:37:11.453]  Again, I already have the adult volume here, about 10,000 kilometers away from where the meeting is being held.
[02:37:11.453 --> 02:37:13.654]  I already know what these people are going to be talking about.
[02:37:13.654 --> 02:37:21.176]  And again, the number one item is the Builderbergers' view on China as an inevitable strategic threat.
[02:37:21.176 --> 02:37:24.497]  Now the stakes are extraordinarily high for Builderbergers.
[02:37:24.497 --> 02:37:25.638]  The threat is to maintain
[02:37:26.078 --> 02:37:26.478]  I think so.
[02:37:45.831 --> 02:37:54.414]  Which I predicted back in 2005, after the meeting in Rotterdam, Germany, when I said that the oil was going to go to about $150 a barrel.
[02:37:54.414 --> 02:38:00.776]  Again, it's all on the internet, people can see it, and it's also in the True Story of the Deliver Group and one of my Deliver Reports.
[02:38:00.776 --> 02:38:06.958]  I said back in 2005 that oil was going to go, by 2009, to $150 a barrel.
[02:38:06.958 --> 02:38:07.358]  Why?
[02:38:07.358 --> 02:38:08.639]  Why are they doing this?
[02:38:08.639 --> 02:38:13.020]  Because, again, for the Chinese, the only way they can maintain their double-digit growth
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:13.900]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:29.781 --> 02:38:35.123]  We're witnessing right now the intent by the build-up of a relief to destroy the Chinese.
[02:38:35.123 --> 02:38:41.946]  Of course, it's a very dangerous game because both the United States and the Chinese and also the Russians have nuclear weapons.
[02:38:41.946 --> 02:38:48.449]  And again, the Chinese know exactly what is being done to them because the same thing was done about 20 years ago.
[02:38:48.969 --> 02:38:49.349]  We're good to go.
[02:39:10.942 --> 02:39:11.502]  We're good to go.
[02:39:31.747 --> 02:39:39.350]  That these elites were very concerned with the movement behind Ron Paul and the freedom movement and the fact that he was quite a popular candidate.
[02:39:39.350 --> 02:39:44.152]  He now has had a number one New York Times best-selling book.
[02:39:44.152 --> 02:39:45.292]  Is he going to be on the agenda?
[02:39:45.292 --> 02:39:49.273]  Are they going to be discussing, you know, Ron Paul, his followers, this freedom movement?
[02:39:49.273 --> 02:39:50.514]  Do you think that's going to be on the table?
[02:39:51.741 --> 02:40:04.870]  No, again, these are global issues and, you know, the Ron Paul might be discussed somewhere during lunch conversation or, you know, after cocktails, but they're not going to waste all these people's time talking about Ron Paul.
[02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:11.074]  And also, to most people, Ron Paul is not an issue, and to the people, especially the American representatives,
[02:40:11.394 --> 02:40:13.435]  Who may consider Ron Paul an issue.
[02:40:13.435 --> 02:40:20.536]  They will discuss it in closed door meetings, behind closed doors, so that most people won't be able to even know what is being said and discussed.
[02:40:20.536 --> 02:40:28.398]  Because again, there's one, the Build-A-Bear conference, where 125 people meet and they hear what everybody thinks.
[02:40:28.398 --> 02:40:36.060]  And then you have the steering committee, the inner circle, which is about 50-60 people who attend annually all of these conferences.
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:49.661]  And of course, the biggest decisions, the long-range decisions that affect humanity are made from behind the scenes by the 50, 60 people who have been attending Good Hoover Burgers for decades, if not generations.
[02:40:50.401 --> 02:40:55.968]  Well, it's become evident in this country that this administration definitely wants to go to war with Iran.
[02:40:55.968 --> 02:40:57.530]  We've taken over Afghanistan.
[02:40:57.530 --> 02:40:59.252]  We've taken over Iraq.
[02:40:59.252 --> 02:41:07.562]  If we were able to establish a presence in Iran and go into that country and take it over, it seems like we would be that much closer.
[02:41:07.882 --> 02:41:08.543]  We're good to go.
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:30.627]  You know, in 2005, again, when they met in Germany, I said, uh, Iran wars are off the table.
[02:41:30.627 --> 02:41:42.883]  I've been saying Iran wars are off the table for the past three and a half years, and I still say Iran wars are off the table, although there are certain people within the American administration who are absolutely eager and dead set on getting this war going before Bush is out of office.
[02:41:43.363 --> 02:41:45.165]  Iran War is off the table.
[02:41:45.165 --> 02:41:57.314]  I know you can't read my lips, but I'm saying it over and over again because, again, European builders have drawn the line, the proverbial line in the sand, and have told the American delegation and the American government to stay out of there.
[02:41:57.314 --> 02:42:06.401]  And, again, while the people, you can see that the Iran War is off the table by understanding the behind-the-scenes movements, especially in the United States elections.
[02:42:06.401 --> 02:42:11.045]  The Barack Obama nomination is really no surprise because, again, if you keep in mind
[02:42:11.445 --> 02:42:12.146]  We're good to go.
[02:42:26.603 --> 02:42:36.910]  And it's Brzezinski who's organizing the new strategy, and the new strategy is Syria and Iran along with the enemies, the new enemies are China, Russia, and Pakistan.
[02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:42.253]  And again, the first solver in that new war was the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
[02:42:42.253 --> 02:42:46.776]  You're witnessing right now a lot of orators being made against the Russians, and of course,
[02:42:47.756 --> 02:42:51.599]  The high oil prices is a key element in the war against China.
[02:42:51.599 --> 02:43:02.786]  And very, very interesting is one of the key sub-points, I just wrote it down because I just got off the phone with a source, to be discussed this year at Bilderberg is the Chinese vulnerability to economic attack.
[02:43:02.786 --> 02:43:13.493]  Now, Rand, again, Rand is a big new Brzezinski's domain, has just issued a secret report that stated unequivocally that, I quote, China is at a
[02:43:14.373 --> 02:43:28.240]  I'm just reading my chicken scribble.
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:29.660]  I can't quite see what it said.
[02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:39.065]  Anyway, so the point is, again, when it's on the agenda, Brzezinski is there, and again, the people who are leading this new attack into the near future are the same people
[02:43:40.425 --> 02:43:48.995]  Uh, I think basically when, uh, if Obama is elected president, uh, we might root for the old days of George W. Bush.
[02:43:48.995 --> 02:43:56.765]  Because with Brzezinski in power, as the man behind the throne, we might find it quite unsavory to hear future political events around the world.
[02:43:57.205 --> 02:44:04.773]  Absolutely, and Brzezinski is the guy who wrote the Grand Chess Board and was responsible for funding the Mujahideen and really creating Al-Qaeda folks.
[02:44:04.773 --> 02:44:13.142]  I mean, just do a Google image search on Brzezinski and you'll see him with the quote-unquote freedom fighters and he's anything but a freedom fighter.
[02:44:13.142 --> 02:44:14.504]  He's a hardcore globalist.
[02:44:14.804 --> 02:44:25.026]  Now you mentioned something that Pakistan is going to suddenly become the enemy, and that seems like sort of a flip from the last almost seven years since 9-11 when they were declared an ally.
[02:44:25.026 --> 02:44:30.668]  There was some rhetoric and some talk of Pakistan initially, you know, being an enemy.
[02:44:30.668 --> 02:44:32.288]  Colin Powell and others mentioned them.
[02:44:32.288 --> 02:44:34.289]  Joe Biden mentioned them.
[02:44:34.289 --> 02:44:39.690]  But then they decided to allow us to put our troops there for launch against other nations.
[02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:45.993]  And they've been defended even though, you know, it's been said Bin Laden has been in the tribal lands for the last four or five years.
[02:44:45.993 --> 02:44:55.378]  So you're saying that now it's gonna be a complete 180, the United States is gonna consider Pakistan the enemy, and do you think that they're gonna use, you know, this Bin Laden propaganda as their tool?
[02:44:57.051 --> 02:45:03.314]  Well, again, if you look historically, especially, we don't have to go very far in history, we just have to go back about, you know, two decades.
[02:45:03.314 --> 02:45:13.199]  They tried to destroy Russia by joining forces with the Chinese, who, of course, were supporting the Taliban against the Russians, and they destroyed the Soviet Union, almost wiped it off the map.
[02:45:13.199 --> 02:45:21.083]  Now they're doing the same thing against the Chinese, and, of course, the greatest manufacturer of this entire orchestrated attack on the Chinese,
[02:45:21.543 --> 02:45:27.967]  By pushing the oil prices up, of course, Russia, which is one of, you know, the second biggest oil producers in the world.
[02:45:27.967 --> 02:45:39.235]  And the same thing, you're looking again, the interest change, geopolitics change, and you have the Pakistanis, who are American friends, or were never really American friends, they were just, you know, friends of convenience.
[02:45:39.235 --> 02:45:45.599]  And now, again, who are the Chinese, who are the Americans, and build up, they're making overtures to, well, they're making overtures to the Indians.
[02:45:46.055 --> 02:45:46.555]  We're good to go.
[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:18.676]  So with Brzezinski's involvement with this Obama campaign, and now Obama getting the nomination yesterday, seemingly getting the nomination with Hillary bowing out, do you feel that he's going to keep his quote-unquote promises to end the war in Iraq?
[02:46:18.676 --> 02:46:20.759]  Are they going to redirect troops?
[02:46:20.759 --> 02:46:21.319]  What do you think?
[02:46:21.319 --> 02:46:22.821]  What do you think is the plan?
[02:46:22.821 --> 02:46:23.642]  How are they going to do this?
[02:46:25.274 --> 02:46:29.640]  Well, I don't know because, you know, between now and November a lot can still happen.
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:31.743]  And again, Ron Paul is still in the election.
[02:46:31.743 --> 02:46:33.586]  Nobody really pushed him out.
[02:46:33.586 --> 02:46:40.275]  And there's still a lot to be said because, again, for example, I just got back a couple of... Last week I was in Cancun in Mexico.
[02:46:40.915 --> 02:46:44.098]  A very important international conference called PQI.
[02:46:44.098 --> 02:46:48.401]  A lot of people from around the world, especially the United States, came.
[02:46:48.401 --> 02:46:50.863]  And again, it's kind of an anti-Bilderberg movement.
[02:46:50.863 --> 02:46:55.947]  A lot of people who have a lot of influence on the world stage in decision-making.
[02:46:55.947 --> 02:46:58.529]  Some people attended very important secret meetings.
[02:46:58.529 --> 02:47:03.953]  Representatives of private organizations from around the world came and offered their help.
[02:47:03.953 --> 02:47:08.857]  Multi-millionaires offered money to put up resistance to the Bilderberg world plans.
[02:47:10.078 --> 02:47:13.161]  So there's a lot still to be said by the world community.
[02:47:13.161 --> 02:47:16.043]  Things are not going as quickly as Bilderberg would like them to go.
[02:47:16.043 --> 02:47:22.168]  They're going too fast, as far as we're concerned, but not nearly as fast as the Bilderbergers wish.
[02:47:22.168 --> 02:47:24.190]  And between now and November, a lot can still happen.
[02:47:24.190 --> 02:47:27.052]  And again, John McCain is a very sick man.
[02:47:27.052 --> 02:47:32.056]  And, you know, there's no guarantee that he'll even make it to be the President of the United States, of course.
[02:47:32.475 --> 02:47:40.534]  All this information is being well hidden by the mainstream corporate press, who, by the way, is pretending to mask the Bill of Rights conference in Virginia.
[02:47:40.534 --> 02:47:42.439]  But that's another story for another day.
[02:47:42.984 --> 02:47:44.864]  Yeah, but they're attending as actual members.
[02:47:44.864 --> 02:47:49.846]  They're not attending to actually report on the Bilderberg Group.
[02:47:49.846 --> 02:47:51.166]  That's exactly what I mean.
[02:47:51.166 --> 02:47:57.388]  They're part of it, part of the group, and obviously none of it is going to be heard in Europe or in the United States.
[02:47:57.388 --> 02:48:07.470]  Again, there's not a lot being said in Europe either, because most people see this as some kind of a peripheral thing and some kind of a movement put forward by conspiracy theories.
[02:48:07.470 --> 02:48:10.611]  My book has precipitated to a great extent this.
[02:48:11.044 --> 02:48:38.694]  You know, particular theory of the Build-A-Builder, I read about Cabal, but still there's just too many people out there who unfortunately believe that what is on mainstream television, on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post, is the truth and bad news, when unfortunately we know that the real news and the real truths can never ever be in the pages of the leading American and world periodicals, all controlled by the same people who just happen to be members of the Build-A-Builder inner circle.
[02:48:39.161 --> 02:48:58.146]  Well, there's no doubt within the last few years this stuff has exploded on the world stage and more and more people are actually waking up to the fact that Bilderberg does indeed exist, they do indeed set policy, and I think you can see that with even Bill Clinton now admitting that he attended Bilderberg and they indeed do set policy there.
[02:48:58.146 --> 02:49:06.168]  He denied that he was there to set any policy in the United States, said he was there to discuss with some Europeans what was going to happen in Russia.
[02:49:06.588 --> 02:49:08.270]  I think not enough people are paying attention.
[02:49:08.270 --> 02:49:09.030]  We're really running out of time.
[02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:12.973]  The window of opportunity to win this and turn this around is closing very quickly, so unless people wake up
[02:49:31.064 --> 02:49:32.945]  And get this straight, and get this right.
[02:49:32.945 --> 02:49:40.809]  Again, I've been saying this for a long time, and I'm going to say this again to take advantage of it, is that the United States no longer has a country to call your own.
[02:49:40.809 --> 02:49:41.050]  Okay?
[02:49:41.050 --> 02:49:43.711]  You no longer have a government that protects you.
[02:49:43.711 --> 02:49:45.832]  The Supreme Court doesn't work for you.
[02:49:45.832 --> 02:49:49.334]  The Congressmen and the Senators are not there to protect your rights.
[02:49:49.334 --> 02:49:52.216]  You don't have a Constitution, and you don't have a Bill of Rights.
[02:49:52.216 --> 02:49:53.056]  You have nothing.
[02:49:53.056 --> 02:49:56.078]  You don't have a flag, and you don't have the national anthem.
[02:49:56.078 --> 02:49:57.579]  You can still sing along.
[02:49:57.579 --> 02:49:58.819]  It's no longer yours.
[02:49:58.819 --> 02:49:59.740]  It's been taken over.
[02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:04.563]  And the war against terror is not against the terrorists, it's against us, the people.
[02:50:04.563 --> 02:50:20.334]  We, the people, especially the people who want freedom, are the biggest enemy of the Bilderberg Group, which is one of the reasons I can't go to this meeting because, again, they would have loved to have me there because I would have been apprehended and obviously put in prison.
[02:50:20.334 --> 02:50:24.617]  So, again, the war against terror is not against the terrorists, it's against us, the people.
[02:50:24.617 --> 02:50:26.819]  And we better get this straight very, very quickly.
[02:50:27.299 --> 02:50:31.881]  Unless we want to join so many others in concentration camps around the world.
[02:50:49.013 --> 02:50:50.994]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:50:50.994 --> 02:50:57.956]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:50:57.956 --> 02:51:06.339]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:06.339 --> 02:51:12.081]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:12.381 --> 02:51:12.781]  I don't know.

[02:51:48.602 --> 02:52:01.755]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:52:01.755 --> 02:52:05.579]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:52:05.879 --> 02:52:06.239]  We're good to go.
[02:52:32.398 --> 02:52:32.738]  I'm good.
[02:52:49.022 --> 02:52:55.167]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[02:52:55.167 --> 02:53:01.713]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[02:53:01.713 --> 02:53:10.761]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.

[02:53:43.983 --> 02:53:56.048]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:56.048 --> 02:54:04.231]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back with one final segment with Daniel Estillan, the international best-selling author of the true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:54:05.447 --> 02:54:08.168]  And Daniel, you were saying, you know, we are running out of time.
[02:54:08.168 --> 02:54:09.869]  We need to do something.
[02:54:09.869 --> 02:54:16.972]  In this last small segment, why don't you give out some of the solutions you think that we can use?
[02:54:16.972 --> 02:54:20.433]  Well, I think the most important thing is people have to understand how money works.
[02:54:20.433 --> 02:54:23.814]  That's one of the greatest concerns for anybody who wants to stay free.
[02:54:23.814 --> 02:54:26.956]  We don't understand debt and we don't understand money.
[02:54:26.956 --> 02:54:32.778]  We don't understand how to spend it and what we can do with it, and also how we can use the power of money to destroy Billiard.
[02:54:33.278 --> 02:54:34.299]  We're good to go.
[02:55:03.058 --> 02:55:03.699]  We're good to go.
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:27.862]  We're good to go.
[02:55:38.979 --> 02:55:39.739]  We're good to go.
[02:56:05.233 --> 02:56:11.454]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:56:11.454 --> 02:56:19.556]  They love you to be in debt so that they can take your home, your car, and really control the way that you live, and hard currency is the answer to that.
[02:56:19.556 --> 02:56:23.597]  Precious metals are going to maintain their value throughout history.
[02:56:23.597 --> 02:56:30.139]  I mean, they've maintained their value for thousands of years, folks, and gold and silver are always going to be a smart investment.
[02:56:31.633 --> 02:56:33.555]  In closing, Daniel, what do you think?
[02:56:33.555 --> 02:56:34.856]  How do we spread this information?
[02:56:34.856 --> 02:56:35.978]  Obviously, you're an author.
[02:56:35.978 --> 02:56:38.080]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:41.003]  You know, I'm trying to reach as many people as possible.
[02:56:41.003 --> 02:56:44.907]  We obviously have to talk to our friends, our family members about this.
[02:56:44.907 --> 02:56:47.349]  But when are we going to have the mainstream breakthrough?
[02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:48.210]  Will it ever come?
[02:56:48.934 --> 02:56:51.557]  Well, you know, I don't think we need the mainstream.
[02:56:51.557 --> 02:56:58.305]  We can win this war, as my publisher Chris Milligan says, we can win this war with pots and pans.
[02:56:58.305 --> 02:57:03.892]  There is no such thing as armed confrontation, because it will destroy us, because they're far more powerful than we are.
[02:57:03.892 --> 02:57:05.634]  But there are a few of them, and we're many.
[02:57:05.634 --> 02:57:06.876]  There's over six and a half
[02:57:07.376 --> 02:57:08.117]  We're good to go.
[02:57:32.134 --> 02:57:32.994]  We're good to go.
[02:57:54.318 --> 02:57:57.379]  Well, the explanation sounds sensible and credible.
[02:57:57.379 --> 02:57:59.400]  Otherwise, we'll lose them.
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:02.381]  And this is the worst thing that could possibly happen to us.
[02:58:02.381 --> 02:58:05.582]  We need as many people on our side as possible.
[02:58:05.582 --> 02:58:07.703]  The window of opportunity is closing.
[02:58:07.703 --> 02:58:12.885]  And again, people, what they need to understand is what we're witnessing right now, this is not an accident.
[02:58:12.885 --> 02:58:15.245]  I saw this about 10 or 11 years ago.
[02:58:15.245 --> 02:58:19.927]  I told Alex, I think in December, that what we're witnessing is demand destruction.
[02:58:19.927 --> 02:58:22.448]  It was a phrase in one of the Bloomberg reports.
[02:58:22.668 --> 02:58:24.870]  All right, Daniel, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:30.697]  His book is The True Story of the Bilderberg Club.
[02:58:30.697 --> 02:58:33.199]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:33.199 --> 02:58:35.522]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:40.511]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:40.511 --> 02:58:44.133]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:44.133 --> 02:58:46.214]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:46.214 --> 02:58:49.616]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:49.616 --> 02:58:55.360]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:59.262]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:58:59.582 --> 02:59:04.784]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:59:04.784 --> 02:59:07.846]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:59:28.715 --> 02:59:30.755]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:59:30.755 --> 02:59:32.756]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:59:32.756 --> 02:59:34.897]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:59:34.897 --> 02:59:36.657]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:59:36.657 --> 02:59:41.198]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:59:41.198 --> 02:59:43.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.599 --> 02:59:46.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.350 --> 03:00:03.491]  All right, folks!
[03:00:03.491 --> 03:00:06.992]  We are back for the fourth and final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.992 --> 03:00:12.374]  Remember, we are live streaming television over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:12.374 --> 03:00:16.576]  Hopefully, Alex is going to be calling in in this final hour.
[03:00:16.576 --> 03:00:17.776]  And we're going to be taking your calls.
[03:00:17.776 --> 03:00:23.399]  I'm not sure if we still have Mike in Montana on the line, but if we do, we're going to go to Mike right now.
[03:00:23.399 --> 03:00:26.620]  Mike, you're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:29.981]  All right, let's go to Dave in California there.
[03:00:29.981 --> 03:00:30.922]  Dave, are you with us?
[03:00:30.922 --> 03:00:31.262]  Hi, Jason.
[03:00:31.262 --> 03:00:31.982]  How are you doing?
[03:00:32.250 --> 03:00:33.090]  Great job, man.
[03:00:33.090 --> 03:00:34.390]  I really like your format.
[03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:36.931]  It's a nice counterpoint to Alex's.
[03:00:36.931 --> 03:00:37.391]  Oh, thank you.
[03:00:37.391 --> 03:00:40.051]  Okay, I got two quack things.
[03:00:40.051 --> 03:00:40.751]  YouTube.
[03:00:40.751 --> 03:00:49.533]  That seems like a natural dollar-making opportunity to somebody who wants to invest in a freedom-oriented movie-sharing thing, something big.
[03:00:49.533 --> 03:00:51.893]  So anyway, put that out to the people out there that have got money.
[03:00:51.893 --> 03:00:53.754]  Sure, not me.
[03:00:53.754 --> 03:00:59.055]  And I wanted just to remind everybody that 9-11 not only was an inside job, 9-11 still is an inside job.
[03:01:02.145 --> 03:01:05.167]  Everything that they're doing hinges on 9-11.
[03:01:05.167 --> 03:01:09.730]  Everything that they're telling us hinges on 9-11, and the cover-up continues to this day.
[03:01:09.730 --> 03:01:17.496]  So, you know, I appreciate the thought that 9-11 was an inside job, but everybody keeps getting told, oh, no, that happened seven years ago.
[03:01:17.496 --> 03:01:24.300]  You know, but it's not only is an inside job, it's getting bigger and bigger all the time, and I think it's a weak point in their armor.
[03:01:25.782 --> 03:01:50.033]  Well absolutely it is the weakest point in their armor because again this was documented on thousands of cameras on that day and we have a news apparatus or had a news apparatus at that time much larger than you know that of the era of the Kennedy assassination or the Gulf of Tonkin incident or the Vietnam War and enough people were able to look at this information and say hey wait a minute this is this is open source information this is mainstream media and this is contradicting
[03:01:50.965 --> 03:01:57.336]  Uh, you know, the supposed official version of these 19 guys in a cave directed by Osama and Laden that did this thing.
[03:01:57.796 --> 03:01:58.236]  Yeah.
[03:01:58.236 --> 03:02:00.598]  And now more and more people are waking up to it.
[03:02:00.598 --> 03:02:07.762]  And the reason that it's still so important seven plus years later, it's not seven years later yet, but it will be, it'll be before we blink folks.
[03:02:07.762 --> 03:02:10.044]  I mean, the summer is going to end September 11, 2008.
[03:02:10.044 --> 03:02:11.585]  We'll be here.
[03:02:11.585 --> 03:02:15.727]  It'll be seven years on is because it still makes the front page of the paper.
[03:02:15.727 --> 03:02:18.649]  You still, you still hear about the post nine 11 world.
[03:02:18.649 --> 03:02:24.693]  It's still the excuse for the Patriot acts for the military commissions act for Homeland security, which is a totally corrupt,
[03:02:25.302 --> 03:02:25.562]  I don't know.
[03:02:41.696 --> 03:02:42.116]  Yeah, I am.
[03:02:42.116 --> 03:02:44.138]  Here in the local area, I've pushed it real hard.
[03:02:44.138 --> 03:02:50.703]  I can't get out much, but I've definitely done a lot of stuff around here, and I do see people waking up a lot more than even a year ago.
[03:03:06.052 --> 03:03:07.873]  Well, I agree with you there, and I thank you for the call.
[03:03:07.873 --> 03:03:09.634]  We're going to jump to the next caller.
[03:03:09.634 --> 03:03:13.196]  It's supposedly Justin in Texas, but I'm going to guess it's not Justin in Texas.
[03:03:13.196 --> 03:03:14.177]  It's somebody else.
[03:03:14.177 --> 03:03:15.418]  Go ahead, Justin.
[03:03:15.418 --> 03:03:16.438]  Hi, Jason.
[03:03:16.438 --> 03:03:17.239]  Good to talk to you again.
[03:03:17.239 --> 03:03:17.919]  Oh, it is.
[03:03:17.919 --> 03:03:23.682]  We're just calling up to hopefully get in some comments about controlled demolitions and your thought on that.
[03:03:23.682 --> 03:03:24.883]  Sure.
[03:03:24.883 --> 03:03:34.489]  Yeah, I was wondering if, during the mechanism of collapse on the World Trade Center towers, they both initiated at the same point of impact as the airplanes.
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:36.140]  Right?
[03:03:36.140 --> 03:03:42.923]  Okay, so how could it have been that the Controlled Demolitions Incorporated that you guys supposed did the attacks on them?
[03:03:42.923 --> 03:03:44.644]  I never said CDI did the attacks.
[03:03:44.644 --> 03:03:45.024]  Hold on.
[03:03:45.024 --> 03:03:45.965]  Alright.
[03:03:45.965 --> 03:03:47.025]  Alright, hold on.
[03:03:47.025 --> 03:03:51.087]  I'm going to give you every opportunity to talk, but when you misquote me, I have to correct you.
[03:03:51.087 --> 03:03:53.868]  CDI was commissioned to clean it up.
[03:03:53.868 --> 03:03:54.749]  That's all I've ever said.
[03:03:55.249 --> 03:03:56.852]  Okay, CDI came in and cleaned that up.
[03:03:56.852 --> 03:03:59.776]  They cleaned up also Oklahoma City.
[03:03:59.776 --> 03:04:05.103]  Alright, and now your question is, well, how could the demolition be at the impacts of these planes?
[03:04:05.103 --> 03:04:07.526]  Those entire buildings were rigged for demolition.
[03:04:07.526 --> 03:04:07.867]  In other words,
[03:04:08.598 --> 03:04:11.660]  The top 20 floors above the impact were also rigged for demolitions.
[03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:18.424]  That's why there's not a huge 20-story part of the World Trade Center on the ground, because if it had tipped over, that's what you would have seen.
[03:04:18.424 --> 03:04:25.448]  You can clearly see squibs going off 20, 40, and 60 floors below this supposed collapse initiation point.
[03:04:25.448 --> 03:04:27.549]  And we'll get into more of it on the other side.
[03:04:27.549 --> 03:04:28.850]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:28.850 --> 03:04:30.131]  Hold the collar over.
[03:04:30.131 --> 03:04:32.032]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:46.144 --> 03:04:47.585]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:47.585 --> 03:04:50.387]  A New World Order.
[03:04:50.387 --> 03:04:54.889]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:54.889 --> 03:04:58.111]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:58.111 --> 03:05:00.893]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.893 --> 03:05:04.095]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:04.095 --> 03:05:11.400]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.423 --> 03:05:19.867]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.867 --> 03:05:23.749]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.749 --> 03:05:26.311]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:26.311 --> 03:05:27.492]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.492 --> 03:05:28.272]  They're not after money.
[03:05:28.272 --> 03:05:29.533]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.533 --> 03:05:30.534]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.534 --> 03:05:31.675]  That's their after-mission.

[03:05:43.202 --> 03:05:44.243]  You have been warned.
[03:05:45.244 --> 03:05:48.146]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:05:48.146 --> 03:05:52.549]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[03:05:52.549 --> 03:05:56.112]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the Antichrist.
[03:05:56.112 --> 03:05:59.875]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the Antichrist?
[03:05:59.875 --> 03:06:03.818]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:06:03.818 --> 03:06:05.880]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:12.046]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[03:06:12.046 --> 03:06:13.988]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[03:06:13.988 --> 03:06:15.970]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[03:06:15.970 --> 03:06:19.253]  1 John states, the Antichrist is already in the world.
[03:06:19.253 --> 03:06:21.396]  What is the truth and what is a lie?
[03:06:21.396 --> 03:06:23.758]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[03:06:23.758 --> 03:06:25.460]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.

[03:06:44.088 --> 03:06:45.769]  Hi, neighbor.
[03:06:45.769 --> 03:06:48.230]  This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:51.752]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[03:06:51.752 --> 03:06:54.753]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you
[03:06:56.735 --> 03:07:03.959]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[03:07:24.350 --> 03:07:27.573]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[03:07:27.573 --> 03:07:29.535]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[03:07:29.535 --> 03:07:30.716]  Decide now.
[03:07:30.716 --> 03:07:32.297]  Place your bet.
[03:07:32.297 --> 03:07:34.139]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[03:07:34.139 --> 03:07:35.580]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:36.120]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:39.323]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:53.507 --> 03:07:54.328]  All right, we are back.
[03:07:54.328 --> 03:07:55.508]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:55.508 --> 03:08:00.112]  I got a caller on the line asking about CDI's involvement in 9-11.
[03:08:00.112 --> 03:08:05.795]  Controlled Demolition Incorporated, run by the Lizot family, has been a military contractor for years.
[03:08:05.795 --> 03:08:13.181]  They are one of the few controlled demolition companies out there that can take down a building, a large-sized building.
[03:08:13.181 --> 03:08:18.484]  I mean, there aren't that many controlled demolition businesses in this country.
[03:08:18.484 --> 03:08:20.285]  Again, they get government contracts all the time.
[03:08:20.285 --> 03:08:20.986]  They're family-run.
[03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:28.714]  I never said that they were the ones that rigged up the towers, but they were the ones responsible for cleaning up the towers.
[03:08:28.714 --> 03:08:31.315]  Now, quote-unquote, Justin, is that even your real name?
[03:08:31.315 --> 03:08:32.716]  Is it Dan or Justin, man?
[03:08:32.716 --> 03:08:33.976]  I mean, you're the same guy, right?
[03:08:33.976 --> 03:08:35.797]  My name is Justin.
[03:08:35.797 --> 03:08:44.542]  Alex knows my name is Justin because he called me back in my house to verify that, but I just want to make a quick comment and then, you know, I could take your answer off the air.
[03:08:44.542 --> 03:08:50.705]  I just was thinking that if the impact of the planes hit at the exact initiated collapse point of the building,
[03:08:51.627 --> 03:08:57.353]  How would that be such a great guess from whoever set up the controlled demolition?
[03:08:57.353 --> 03:08:57.973]  I'll answer.
[03:08:57.973 --> 03:09:00.376]  I don't think it's a guess, number one.
[03:09:00.376 --> 03:09:08.784]  You see, for instance, the second plane that goes into the building, you clearly see a demo charge go off outside of the explosion of the plane.
[03:09:08.784 --> 03:09:10.065]  It's in the center of the building.
[03:09:10.065 --> 03:09:11.166]  It's a small squib.
[03:09:11.166 --> 03:09:12.487]  It looks just like the other squibs.
[03:09:12.487 --> 03:09:14.990]  Now, with the first strike of the World Trade Center, that plane
[03:09:15.467 --> 03:09:16.467]  Look up 20 floors.
[03:09:16.467 --> 03:09:18.328]  You'll see the exact same squib going off.
[03:09:18.328 --> 03:09:24.289]  You'll see another squib in the middle of the building pop out, and the whole floor pop out around the 105th floor.
[03:09:24.289 --> 03:09:27.470]  I don't think... You do see a whole section of the top building falling, though.
[03:09:27.470 --> 03:09:28.710]  I'm not talking about collapse.
[03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:29.270]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:09:29.270 --> 03:09:30.551]  I'm not talking about collapse.
[03:09:30.551 --> 03:09:39.513]  I'm talking about when these planes hit those buildings, that you could see squibs being knocked loose from the demolition charges that were placed in the buildings.
[03:09:39.513 --> 03:09:40.233]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:09:40.583 --> 03:09:40.863]  Okay.
[03:09:40.863 --> 03:09:45.127]  It just seems that there's a lot of floors that they would have had to load up with controlled demolitions.
[03:09:45.127 --> 03:09:49.871]  And I mean, I've heard you guys say that a couple of floors were restricted or there was limited access.
[03:09:49.871 --> 03:09:51.532]  Well, it wasn't a couple of floors, man.
[03:09:51.532 --> 03:09:52.092]  I mean, all right.
[03:09:52.092 --> 03:09:54.034]  Let me, let me, let me talk on that for a second.
[03:09:54.034 --> 03:09:58.057]  I interviewed Gary Corbett in 2006, right before the anniversary.
[03:09:58.057 --> 03:09:59.018]  He worked in the buildings.
[03:09:59.018 --> 03:09:59.839]  He approached me.
[03:09:59.839 --> 03:10:01.440]  I didn't know who he was.
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:02.841]  He had gone to our site.
[03:10:02.841 --> 03:10:07.625]  He saw the Scott Forbes article that is now a notorious where Scott Forbes claimed that, uh,
[03:10:08.246 --> 03:10:14.349]  Certain floors were shut down in the weekend before the attacks and that they were given access to a new security system.
[03:10:14.349 --> 03:10:14.950]  Okay?
[03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:18.051]  Now, Gary Corbett comes up to me and he tells me the same exact story.
[03:10:18.051 --> 03:10:25.015]  He says that they were knocking down, uh, I think something like three to four floors at a time, powering them down, clearing them out.
[03:10:25.015 --> 03:10:30.138]  And he said that when he got there on Monday, he was very confused because this new security system wasn't working.
[03:10:30.138 --> 03:10:32.539]  And a lot of the, uh, a lot of the, uh,
[03:10:33.274 --> 03:10:43.580]  Businesses on the floors were upset because they couldn't they couldn't get their their security working and he said it caused a big hubbub people were being called in and out and people were unhappy and of course the attacks happened on Tuesday.
[03:10:43.580 --> 03:10:47.963]  Do I know that they rigged those buildings for demolition the weekend before?
[03:10:47.963 --> 03:10:52.366]  I don't know that but I do know that John Gross is on camera
[03:10:53.353 --> 03:10:55.854]  He's not saying that there was no molten metal at the scene.
[03:10:55.854 --> 03:10:59.235]  He's like, well let's go to your initial premise that there was molten metal on the scene.
[03:10:59.235 --> 03:10:59.876]  He denies it!
[03:10:59.876 --> 03:11:01.316]  He says no one reported it.
[03:11:01.316 --> 03:11:15.082]  Now I've got probably half a dozen newspaper reports and then in loose change final cut I think I have five to six eyewitness accounts including Ken Holden who was on the scene before anybody who was part of FEMA and their team going around.
[03:11:15.082 --> 03:11:17.103]  He's talking about molten metal dripping from six.
[03:11:17.683 --> 03:11:22.850]  Then, he denies that the thermal imagery from NASA even exists.
[03:11:22.850 --> 03:11:23.951]  And that's a big problem for me.
[03:11:23.951 --> 03:11:29.138]  If he's not going to take a look at the thermal imagery that shows these extreme hot spots under 1, 2, 7, and even 6,
[03:11:30.896 --> 03:11:32.237]  Then I don't think he's credible.
[03:11:32.237 --> 03:11:44.423]  And then when he's asked about the rest of the collapse, he said, well, we didn't have to actually do any mathematics or equations for the rest of the collapse of the building because it's very evident what happened to those buildings on the videotape.
[03:11:44.423 --> 03:11:46.684]  All we had to describe was collapse initiation.
[03:11:46.684 --> 03:11:54.348]  Now, you would think in a 10,000 page report, they could explain why the bottom 70 plus floors of each building turned to dust.
[03:11:55.037 --> 03:12:01.479]  Okay, well I have a lot more questions for you, but I appreciate the time you've given me so far, and I just wanted to make a quick comment.
[03:12:01.479 --> 03:12:08.181]  Recently, within the last couple of days, I talked to somebody who was much wiser than myself, who said, you're not going to get anywhere being a jerk.
[03:12:08.181 --> 03:12:10.602]  So I apologize for past smarminess.
[03:12:11.309 --> 03:12:14.251]  And I hope you appreciate the more appropriate dialogue.
[03:12:14.251 --> 03:12:19.255]  I do, and I'm more than willing, I just want to put out that I'm more than willing to speak to my detractors on any level.
[03:12:19.255 --> 03:12:22.918]  You know, I've talked to the SLC guys, I've challenged them to debates.
[03:12:22.918 --> 03:12:25.460]  They're not that, they won't go on against me anymore.
[03:12:25.460 --> 03:12:29.903]  You know, Pat Curley has come on against me a couple times, James B. has never come on against me.
[03:12:29.903 --> 03:12:34.307]  But, you know, I'll look at all the evidence, man, and I'm not in this for any other reason.
[03:12:35.054 --> 03:12:39.396]  Other than what I believe, and I do believe that this was an inside job, and I'm very upset about it.
[03:12:39.396 --> 03:12:40.857]  It does not comfort me.
[03:12:40.857 --> 03:12:45.639]  Well, I gave you the apology, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.
[03:12:45.639 --> 03:12:46.099]  Alright, man.
[03:12:46.099 --> 03:12:46.660]  Have a good day.
[03:12:46.660 --> 03:12:49.461]  Alright, let's go to Joe in Indiana.
[03:12:49.461 --> 03:12:51.642]  Is Joe there?
[03:12:51.642 --> 03:12:52.542]  Hello, Jason.
[03:12:52.542 --> 03:12:53.743]  Hey, how you doing, Joe?
[03:12:53.743 --> 03:12:57.165]  First of all, great job you did on the final cut.
[03:12:57.165 --> 03:12:58.665]  Oh, thank you, man.
[03:12:58.665 --> 03:13:04.328]  And for people like that last caller there, we can change the subject of 9-11 a little bit.
[03:13:04.656 --> 03:13:14.102]  But how can you have, like, the Vice President of Choice Point and Eugene Clinton Curtis speak to members of Congress, and that's not even on mainstream media?
[03:13:14.102 --> 03:13:17.364]  Well, enlighten me, because I don't know anything about this.
[03:13:17.364 --> 03:13:18.384]  Oh, really?
[03:13:18.384 --> 03:13:20.866]  No, hey, I'm not a god, man.
[03:13:20.866 --> 03:13:22.567]  I do a lot of research.
[03:13:22.567 --> 03:13:24.288]  I look at a lot of stuff.
[03:13:24.288 --> 03:13:25.469]  You know, stuff slips by me.
[03:13:25.469 --> 03:13:27.650]  Please talk about Choice Point.
[03:13:27.650 --> 03:13:29.551]  Well, I'll do something on your level there.
[03:13:29.551 --> 03:13:33.553]  Can you explain, because I know on the second edition you put options.
[03:13:34.673 --> 03:13:36.757]  But on the final cut you didn't put that in there?
[03:13:36.757 --> 03:13:36.937]  Yes.
[03:13:38.567 --> 03:13:40.128]  Can you explain, like, exactly where?
[03:13:40.128 --> 03:13:44.530]  Well, the only reason that we didn't cover it in the final cut is because it was covered in the second edition.
[03:13:44.530 --> 03:13:47.712]  And let's go over some of the insider trading on 9-11.
[03:13:47.712 --> 03:13:49.913]  Now, we have insider trading in Boeing Airlines.
[03:13:49.913 --> 03:13:53.355]  We have insider trading in American Airlines in the days before the attacks.
[03:13:53.355 --> 03:13:54.656]  Merrill Lynch, other U.S.
[03:13:54.656 --> 03:13:55.396]  companies.
[03:13:55.396 --> 03:14:07.483]  Now, when this comes to light, the 9-11 Commission covers it in a footnote and says, although it looks suspicious, it couldn't be insider trading because none of it was related to Al-Qaeda.
[03:14:07.483 --> 03:14:07.963]  In other words,
[03:14:08.476 --> 03:14:11.925]  Uh, something like a billion plus of the insider trading went to one U.S.
[03:14:11.925 --> 03:14:14.191]  businessman who had no ties to Al Qaeda.
[03:14:14.191 --> 03:14:16.337]  So, it just had to be a coincidence.
[03:14:16.937 --> 03:14:24.160]  Convar, and this is in the second edition, was commissioned to recover some of the hard drives that were in the rubble at the World Trade Center.
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:28.782]  We all know not everything was destroyed, and hard drives are actually pretty durable things.
[03:14:28.782 --> 03:14:30.243]  You know, it's on a piece of tape.
[03:14:30.243 --> 03:14:33.385]  If you put them into a clean room, you can get data off them.
[03:14:33.385 --> 03:14:44.270]  When they got the data off them, they said, wow, it looks like there were some people in the buildings who knew exactly when the planes were going to strike and moved out hundreds of millions of dollars prior to this.
[03:14:44.270 --> 03:14:45.170]  Now, when he was asked,
[03:14:45.523 --> 03:14:45.943]  I don't think so.
[03:15:09.798 --> 03:15:18.671]  In the stock market, and then we have people on the inside of the World Trade Center complex itself moving out all this money in accordance with these attacks.
[03:15:18.671 --> 03:15:20.894]  Obviously US interests were involved.
[03:15:20.894 --> 03:15:23.017]  You have Larry Klayman, this is going to be in my new film.
[03:15:23.682 --> 03:15:30.726]  Of Judicial Watch, who was representing Robert Wright, who tried to go forward before 9-11 and say, hey, I know how this money's moving.
[03:15:30.726 --> 03:15:36.189]  Saying, well, the reason they're not talking about it is because this money was moving through some powerful U.S.
[03:15:36.189 --> 03:15:40.691]  banks and interests who had reason to know that they were dealing with terrorists.
[03:15:40.691 --> 03:15:43.793]  So, you know, there's no doubt that there were U.S.
[03:15:43.793 --> 03:15:44.773]  interests involved.
[03:15:44.773 --> 03:15:51.737]  Whether we're ever actually going to get that Convair information or we're going to get an investigation into the insider trading, I don't know, man.
[03:15:53.490 --> 03:15:54.371]  Does that answer your question?
[03:15:54.371 --> 03:15:55.611]  That answers my question.
[03:15:55.611 --> 03:15:57.472]  Alright, Joe, thank you for the call.
[03:15:57.472 --> 03:15:59.674]  Let's go to Mike in Idaho.
[03:15:59.674 --> 03:16:00.674]  Mike, are you with us?
[03:16:00.674 --> 03:16:01.955]  Yes, I am.
[03:16:01.955 --> 03:16:06.918]  Hey, I appreciate all your hard work, and you're making a lot of people open their eyes.
[03:16:06.918 --> 03:16:08.579]  Well, thank you, man.
[03:16:08.579 --> 03:16:12.362]  There's another thing you need to... You've heard about the Peer Report Review.
[03:16:12.362 --> 03:16:13.682]  It just came out.
[03:16:13.682 --> 03:16:14.843]  Alex covered it.
[03:16:14.843 --> 03:16:15.684]  I'm not sure, no.
[03:16:15.684 --> 03:16:16.284]  Go ahead.
[03:16:16.284 --> 03:16:20.927]  Okay, it's from Beth Ham, Open Access.
[03:16:20.927 --> 03:16:22.148]  And what this is, is this is...
[03:16:23.433 --> 03:16:25.635]  It's a report.
[03:16:25.635 --> 03:16:29.078]  Basically, it's 14 points of agreement with official government reports.
[03:16:29.078 --> 03:16:30.699]  Oh, the Stephen Jones paper?
[03:16:30.699 --> 03:16:31.019]  Yes.
[03:16:31.019 --> 03:16:35.903]  Okay, now this is something that is serious ammunition.
[03:16:35.903 --> 03:16:40.827]  I just discussed this with somebody in the legislative body, and I am very well connected.
[03:16:40.827 --> 03:16:46.692]  And this is opening up some serious eyes, because this gives your film massive validity.
[03:16:47.096 --> 03:16:56.304]  Oh absolutely, and you know he's done another experiment that although his peer-reviewed paper on the matter has not gotten the attention of this 14 points of agreement, but
[03:16:57.906 --> 03:17:04.609]  His paper on the molten metal that was pouring out of the World Trade Center prior to its collapse is amazing.
[03:17:04.609 --> 03:17:09.591]  Because again, the official version would have us believe that there was no molten metal possible.
[03:17:09.591 --> 03:17:13.033]  Now, when this molten metal is caught on camera pouring out, what do the debunkers say?
[03:17:13.033 --> 03:17:16.054]  Well, that's obviously aluminum from the plane.
[03:17:16.054 --> 03:17:19.815]  Aluminum burns somewhere between 600 and 800 degrees before it's moltenized.
[03:17:19.815 --> 03:17:21.176]  Now, aluminum is silver.
[03:17:21.716 --> 03:17:31.547]  So Jones was good enough to go and do an experiment and say all right well let's let's make some molten silver or I'm sorry molten aluminum and see if it will mesh and make this color
[03:17:32.034 --> 03:17:35.497]  That this molten metal pouring out of the World Trade Center was, and it didn't do that.
[03:17:35.497 --> 03:17:39.221]  And a lot of people have now detracted the aluminum from the plane.
[03:17:39.221 --> 03:17:40.823]  Now they're saying it's batteries.
[03:17:40.823 --> 03:17:47.449]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now, it is clearly molten iron or molten steel or a combination of both.
[03:17:47.449 --> 03:17:49.391]  This thing looks like a foundry.
[03:17:49.391 --> 03:17:53.275]  It literally pours down 60 plus floors and doesn't dissipate.
[03:17:53.275 --> 03:17:54.516]  Only molten metal would do that.
[03:17:55.051 --> 03:17:57.333]  And it's quite interesting.
[03:17:57.333 --> 03:18:00.235]  I just woke up in December, and Ron Paul is the one that woke me up.
[03:18:00.235 --> 03:18:05.560]  I feel very, very bad about what I've told other people a year ago.
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:08.362]  And I was a debunker, in a manner of speaking.
[03:18:08.362 --> 03:18:10.724]  I could not believe my country could do this.
[03:18:10.724 --> 03:18:12.985]  Well, it's very difficult for the majority of us.
[03:18:12.985 --> 03:18:17.249]  I know when I first started to get into this, about six months after the attacks, it was the last thing.
[03:18:17.674 --> 03:18:32.029]  That I wanted to believe about my country, and that's why another one of those debunker arguments just doesn't hold water with me of, well, you know, these conspiratorial minds work in a fashion that they want the world to be this perfect place where our rulers control everything.
[03:18:32.029 --> 03:18:38.475]  No, man, I was way more comfortable thinking it was Muslims in a cave halfway across the world where we could bomb them.
[03:18:38.475 --> 03:18:39.977]  I am much more uncomfortable
[03:18:40.297 --> 03:18:46.762]  With elements within our own military-industrial complex apparatus carrying out these attacks.
[03:18:46.762 --> 03:18:49.885]  And like you said, you know, we just keep having more fuel to fire.
[03:18:49.885 --> 03:18:55.690]  I'm very happy to hear that you woke up in December, because that tells me we can keep waking up more and more minds.
[03:18:55.690 --> 03:19:04.397]  And I just tell people, you know, make copies of our films, hand them out, have movie night, talk to people like a human being, know your information.
[03:19:04.397 --> 03:19:06.498]  I mean, you know, you're going to catch more flies with honey.
[03:19:07.933 --> 03:19:09.414]  Than any other way.
[03:19:09.414 --> 03:19:09.974]  Oh, definitely.
[03:19:09.974 --> 03:19:13.335]  And you know, I'm very well connected also because I'm an armorer.
[03:19:13.335 --> 03:19:13.736]  Okay?
[03:19:13.736 --> 03:19:17.317]  And I deal with a lot of military and I deal with a lot of other people.
[03:19:17.317 --> 03:19:21.999]  And I'm also a veteran of the Navy and the Army and private military.
[03:19:21.999 --> 03:19:24.060]  Well, Mike, I thank you for waking up.
[03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:25.161]  Thank you for the call.
[03:19:25.161 --> 03:19:26.421]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:26.421 --> 03:19:28.442]  We're going to be taking your calls in the last 40 minutes.

[03:21:45.586 --> 03:21:52.249]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:21:52.249 --> 03:22:00.352]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:00.352 --> 03:22:08.196]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:08.536 --> 03:22:13.619]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:13.619 --> 03:22:18.842]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:18.842 --> 03:22:23.185]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:23.185 --> 03:22:24.286]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:24.286 --> 03:22:28.788]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:28.788 --> 03:22:33.691]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:33.691 --> 03:22:36.193]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:22:40.577 --> 03:22:42.179]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:42.179 --> 03:22:50.689]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:22:50.689 --> 03:22:55.775]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:22:56.115 --> 03:23:01.480]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:23:01.480 --> 03:23:07.386]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:23:07.386 --> 03:23:13.632]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:23:13.632 --> 03:23:17.135]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:23:17.395 --> 03:23:22.218]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:23:22.218 --> 03:23:23.258]  Do your part.
[03:23:23.258 --> 03:23:25.900]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[03:23:25.900 --> 03:23:35.104]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[03:23:57.284 --> 03:24:03.328]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[03:24:03.328 --> 03:24:05.589]  I won't even turn my head.
[03:24:07.265 --> 03:24:09.606]  Alright folks, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:24:09.606 --> 03:24:15.867]  I am Jason Burma, subbing in the entire week as Alex takes on the Bilderbergers in Chantilly, Virginia.
[03:24:15.867 --> 03:24:27.490]  And if you missed any of Alex's call-in with Jim Tucker in the first hour, you can go to InfoWars.com, and as soon as this broadcast is over, we replay it all day for free, and there is a podcast.
[03:24:28.823 --> 03:24:38.372]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and if you want to see the last hour video feed, you want to see my pretty little face on the radio, I guess, or my little shirt that I'm going to wear.
[03:24:38.372 --> 03:24:39.754]  I'll put this up there.
[03:24:39.754 --> 03:24:43.577]  Oh, Investigate911, you get that at my website, loosechange911.com.
[03:24:43.577 --> 03:24:45.980]  Become a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber.
[03:24:45.980 --> 03:24:51.225]  They have, I think, something like 40 to 50 documentaries on there now, all of Alex Jones' films.
[03:24:52.159 --> 03:24:54.940]  All of his big interviews on MP3.
[03:24:54.940 --> 03:25:02.103]  I mean, what you get with PrisonPlanet.TV, which is about 15 cents a day, you're not going to get anywhere else, and we really do need your support and help.
[03:25:02.103 --> 03:25:08.206]  That's why the InfoWars Money Bomb is running until Friday, and we're going to be giving out the totals on that.
[03:25:08.206 --> 03:25:08.786]  We've made over $200,000.
[03:25:08.786 --> 03:25:14.548]  That's going to go towards a new office and a new television program, hopefully on Dish Network.
[03:25:14.548 --> 03:25:16.349]  We're really going to try to put it together, folks.
[03:25:16.349 --> 03:25:18.810]  It's not an easy task.
[03:25:19.522 --> 03:25:21.443]  I want to remind people I'm over at Myspace.
[03:25:21.443 --> 03:25:25.145]  Myspace.com slash Jason Burmas if you want to get at me.
[03:25:25.145 --> 03:25:26.386]  I do read my emails.
[03:25:26.386 --> 03:25:27.947]  I do check out my comments.
[03:25:27.947 --> 03:25:29.688]  I do not have an administrator running it.
[03:25:29.688 --> 03:25:31.609]  And I love to hear from you guys.
[03:25:31.609 --> 03:25:34.210]  So that being said, let's take some more callers.
[03:25:34.210 --> 03:25:36.372]  Let's go to Bob in Pennsylvania.
[03:25:36.372 --> 03:25:39.273]  Bob, are you with us?
[03:25:39.273 --> 03:25:40.154]  No Bob?
[03:25:40.154 --> 03:25:41.074]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:25:41.074 --> 03:25:42.175]  Oh, how you doing Bob?
[03:25:42.175 --> 03:25:42.955]  Good.
[03:25:42.955 --> 03:25:46.017]  Jason, I wanted to ask you, whenever it happens,
[03:25:48.293 --> 03:25:55.316]  Last year, around this time, we were kind of told that there may be a theatrical release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:25:55.316 --> 03:25:59.238]  Is that still possibly on the table, or whatever became of that?
[03:25:59.238 --> 03:25:59.658]  Sure, sure.
[03:25:59.658 --> 03:26:03.079]  I mean, I answered this question yesterday, but I'll answer it again today.
[03:26:03.079 --> 03:26:05.140]  Basically, you know, we met with all these Hollywood types.
[03:26:05.140 --> 03:26:06.361]  We talked to people at Paramount.
[03:26:06.361 --> 03:26:07.761]  We talked to people at Lionsgate.
[03:26:07.761 --> 03:26:13.564]  The only people that were really interested in possibly putting this out was Mark Cuban's company, Magnolia, or 2929.
[03:26:15.109 --> 03:26:15.629]  We're good to go.
[03:26:35.081 --> 03:26:36.442]  It's a very big possibility.
[03:26:36.442 --> 03:26:43.005]  I mean, if you look at the other pictures that they put out, they put out that film Redacted, which got some decent press, I guess.
[03:26:43.005 --> 03:26:49.648]  It was against the Iraq War, but it opened in eight theaters, and it was out for two weeks, and it wasn't seen by anybody.
[03:26:49.648 --> 03:26:53.810]  So we saw that, and we said, well, how are we going to take our movie off the internet?
[03:26:53.810 --> 03:26:56.592]  That's what made us big, and this is a completely separate movie.
[03:26:56.592 --> 03:27:00.994]  Why should we sell the rights to our completely separate movie to these people?
[03:27:01.747 --> 03:27:04.288]  And basically, you know, things degraded from there.
[03:27:04.288 --> 03:27:06.489]  It did show up in theaters in the UK.
[03:27:06.489 --> 03:27:08.830]  Picturehouse carried it for a while.
[03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:12.251]  But, you know, it's very hard to get that kind of distribution.
[03:27:12.251 --> 03:27:16.253]  And unfortunately, you know, I don't see us being able to do that.
[03:27:16.253 --> 03:27:23.136]  I mean, it's always a possibility where I'm always talking to people behind the scenes, but when it comes down to it, it's tough.
[03:27:23.136 --> 03:27:27.497]  Do you know anything about the film The Reflecting Pool?
[03:27:27.497 --> 03:27:28.638]  I haven't watched it yet.
[03:27:28.638 --> 03:27:31.059]  I actually do have a copy of that back in New York.
[03:27:31.761 --> 03:27:33.102]  I didn't know that had been out yet.
[03:27:33.102 --> 03:27:35.103]  I thought it was a pending release.
[03:27:35.103 --> 03:27:36.084]  Is that released?
[03:27:36.084 --> 03:27:36.764]  I don't know.
[03:27:36.764 --> 03:27:37.284]  I think so.
[03:27:37.284 --> 03:27:38.225]  I got it on DVD.
[03:27:38.225 --> 03:27:41.407]  I mean, I might have got a pre-screener copy from the filmmakers.
[03:27:41.407 --> 03:27:43.108]  They sent it to Dylan.
[03:27:43.108 --> 03:27:46.710]  But I think you can get that on DVD right now.
[03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:49.792]  I have not watched it, so I really can't give an opinion on it.
[03:27:49.792 --> 03:27:50.192]  Okay.
[03:27:50.192 --> 03:27:50.993]  Well, thank you very much.
[03:27:50.993 --> 03:27:52.954]  You're doing a great job.
[03:27:52.954 --> 03:27:53.634]  Well, thanks, Bob.
[03:27:53.634 --> 03:27:55.395]  I appreciate the support.
[03:27:55.395 --> 03:27:57.397]  Let's go to Graham in Seattle.
[03:27:57.397 --> 03:27:58.097]  Graham, are you with us?
[03:28:00.228 --> 03:28:01.809]  Okay, so then let's go to Darren.
[03:28:01.809 --> 03:28:02.770]  Darren, are you with us?
[03:28:02.770 --> 03:28:03.410]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:28:03.410 --> 03:28:04.071]  How are you, buddy?
[03:28:04.071 --> 03:28:04.451]  Good, man.
[03:28:04.451 --> 03:28:05.372]  How you doing?
[03:28:05.372 --> 03:28:06.552]  All right.
[03:28:06.552 --> 03:28:24.404]  You know, I hear everybody talking about the World Trade Tellers, and no one seems to even touch upon the fact that the engines, when they smashed into the Pentagon, they had to change 90 degrees, travel some feet, and then fit into a 40-foot hole.
[03:28:24.404 --> 03:28:26.866]  Now, what's the distance between the two engines?
[03:28:28.144 --> 03:28:30.947]  Um, I'm not quite sure what the distance of the two engines are.
[03:28:30.947 --> 03:28:55.807]  I know you're talking about a plane with a wingspan of almost 120 feet, uh, in a hole that I wouldn't even say was 40 feet, I would say 16, 20 feet tops, with visible damage maybe 70 feet across, but in order for the wings to penetrate that visible damage, you would think there would be a hole there, when in fact, there isn't a hole, and I think the biggest problem with that for me is the fact that there's no damage from the tail section whatsoever, and this is a huge
[03:28:56.187 --> 03:29:02.410]  Vertical stabilizer on the back of this plane, and it's not on the lawn, and there's no markings from where it would have hit.
[03:29:02.410 --> 03:29:03.971]  So what happened to it?
[03:29:03.971 --> 03:29:08.433]  Yeah, yeah, and the engines themselves, they're what?
[03:29:08.433 --> 03:29:10.995]  Each of them are five tons?
[03:29:10.995 --> 03:29:13.176]  I believe they're over a ton of titanium.
[03:29:13.176 --> 03:29:15.877]  I don't think they're five tons each, but they're almost indestructible.
[03:29:15.877 --> 03:29:19.559]  We cover that in length in loose change second edition.
[03:29:19.559 --> 03:29:21.080]  Graham, hold over so I can keep you up.
[03:29:22.029 --> 03:29:24.510]  On the other side, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:24.510 --> 03:29:36.032]  Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com.
[03:29:36.032 --> 03:29:37.433]  We're on the march.
[03:29:37.433 --> 03:29:39.953]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.953 --> 03:29:42.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:30:07.871 --> 03:30:08.371]  I think so.
[03:30:30.879 --> 03:30:38.642]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:30:58.869 --> 03:31:09.938]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:31:09.938 --> 03:31:13.340]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:31:13.340 --> 03:31:15.102]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:31:15.102 --> 03:31:21.246]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:31:36.856 --> 03:31:39.497]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[03:31:39.497 --> 03:31:44.820]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:31:48.027 --> 03:31:50.348]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[03:31:50.348 --> 03:31:55.450]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[03:31:55.450 --> 03:31:58.131]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[03:31:58.131 --> 03:32:02.413]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[03:32:02.413 --> 03:32:05.474]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[03:32:05.474 --> 03:32:08.795]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[03:32:08.795 --> 03:32:13.677]  Food riots and breadlines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[03:32:13.877 --> 03:32:17.938]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[03:32:17.938 --> 03:32:22.859]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.

[03:32:41.243 --> 03:32:41.643]  Call now.
[03:32:58.979 --> 03:33:00.800]  The Man Before!
[03:33:00.800 --> 03:33:04.161]  Man, I love Metallica.
[03:33:04.161 --> 03:33:09.362]  Even when they're covering stuff, Garage Days Inc.
[03:33:09.362 --> 03:33:12.863]  is one hell of an album, folks.
[03:33:12.863 --> 03:33:15.744]  We're talking to Darren!
[03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:36.519]  And we're talking Pentagon, and we're talking about what hit the Pentagon, but I think it's really just as important as why was the Pentagon even hit?
[03:33:36.519 --> 03:33:39.923]  I mean, this is the most secure building in probably the world.
[03:33:39.923 --> 03:33:43.527]  This is the head of our military-industrial complex right here.
[03:33:43.527 --> 03:33:48.993]  And I just posted over on my blog, loosechange911.com, Norman Mineta's account.
[03:33:49.508 --> 03:33:57.729]  Of what happened in that PEOC, the Presidential Emergency Operating Center, which he wasn't even aware of until 9-11 when they took him down into it.
[03:33:57.729 --> 03:34:09.232]  And on five separate occasions, I have all five videos up there, he confirms that Cheney is in that bunker prior to 9-11, that somebody is coming to him saying, Sir, the plane's 50 miles out.
[03:34:09.232 --> 03:34:10.372]  Sir, the plane's 30 miles out.
[03:34:10.372 --> 03:34:11.892]  Sir, the plane is 10 miles out.
[03:34:11.892 --> 03:34:13.972]  Do the orders still stand?
[03:34:13.972 --> 03:34:15.773]  And he says, of course they still stand.
[03:34:15.773 --> 03:34:17.113]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[03:34:17.637 --> 03:34:20.320]  And they didn't even warn the people in that wing of the Pentagon.
[03:34:20.320 --> 03:34:26.729]  Sure, most of them had been evacuated because it was where there was a bunch of work being done.
[03:34:28.035 --> 03:34:31.156]  But we still lost over 120 people in that building.
[03:34:31.156 --> 03:34:32.977]  And did those people deserve to die?
[03:34:32.977 --> 03:34:33.697]  No.
[03:34:33.697 --> 03:34:35.218]  They deserve to be warned.
[03:34:35.218 --> 03:34:37.098]  And Cheney allowed this to happen.
[03:34:37.098 --> 03:34:44.861]  The 9-11 Commission whitewashed the entire situation by saying that Cheney wasn't in that bunker till almost 10 o'clock, well after the Pentagon strike.
[03:34:44.861 --> 03:34:46.361]  And then there's no more questions asked.
[03:34:46.361 --> 03:34:54.984]  It's okay, because Cheney and Bush testified together, not under oath, in front of the 9-11 Commission, with no record whatsoever of what they said.
[03:34:54.984 --> 03:34:56.585]  No transcript.
[03:34:56.585 --> 03:34:57.105]  No tape.
[03:34:57.950 --> 03:35:03.094]  No verbal confirmation and no commissioners talking about what they actually said.
[03:35:03.094 --> 03:35:06.636]  Do you have any other points on the Pentagon, Darren?
[03:35:06.636 --> 03:35:07.317]  Well, no.
[03:35:07.317 --> 03:35:20.987]  I was just talking about the engines and the instantaneous acceleration that those engines had to go through to change direction and squeeze into that tight, neat little hole that they called an airliner.
[03:35:21.397 --> 03:35:23.899]  Which is an absolute ridiculous assumption.
[03:35:23.899 --> 03:35:26.280]  Well, I'm with you, and I thank you for the call.
[03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:28.942]  Let's keep shooting through these callers.
[03:35:28.942 --> 03:35:30.703]  Let's go to Craig in New Jersey.
[03:35:30.703 --> 03:35:31.944]  Craig, are you with me?
[03:35:31.944 --> 03:35:33.105]  Hey, how you doing, buddy?
[03:35:33.105 --> 03:35:37.748]  You know, I did a few years in the Navy, and here's the thing that bothers me the most about 9-11.
[03:35:37.748 --> 03:35:40.290]  No one's head rolled.
[03:35:40.290 --> 03:35:41.710]  That's number one.
[03:35:41.710 --> 03:35:42.311]  And number two,
[03:35:42.947 --> 03:35:54.338]  Are they really trying to insult our intelligence by telling us that not a single jet fighter in the area could have been dispatched with the exception of from Boston?
[03:35:54.338 --> 03:35:58.202]  Dude, let me tell you something.
[03:35:58.202 --> 03:36:07.030]  Oceana Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia, for example, in 2001 was the air station fighter wing on the East Coast.
[03:36:07.756 --> 03:36:16.440]  So you're trying to tell me they couldn't find one F-14 Tomcat, which could have been basically armed and ready to roll in ten minutes?
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:19.382]  I mean, it's things like that that really bothers me.
[03:36:19.382 --> 03:36:29.727]  Well, what really bothers me is the fact that we also have these simultaneous drills going on, so that fighter jets are put halfway across the country in the wrong direction, and then some of them aren't even armed.
[03:36:30.256 --> 03:36:31.017]  Well, exactly.
[03:36:31.017 --> 03:36:32.077]  I mean, look for this way, too.
[03:36:32.077 --> 03:36:34.800]  You have Naval Air Station Willow Grove in Pennsylvania.
[03:36:34.800 --> 03:36:40.244]  You could have dispatched a doggone A-10 Warthog that flies at like 300 miles an hour to intercept that jet.
[03:36:41.970 --> 03:36:49.277]  Well, with you being in the military, I'd be interested to get your take on the other white plane that was in New York City on the morning of 9-11.
[03:36:49.277 --> 03:36:56.505]  A lot of people know about the white E-4B that was present on the scene of the Pentagon strike, and that was part of the Global Guardian drill.
[03:36:56.505 --> 03:36:57.846]  They had five of those in the air.
[03:36:57.846 --> 03:36:58.807]  Oh yeah, the Doomsday Plane.
[03:36:58.807 --> 03:37:00.269]  The Doomsday Plane, sure.
[03:37:00.269 --> 03:37:02.130]  But if you look at the videos, you've got to type in
[03:37:03.396 --> 03:37:07.981]  World Trade Center first plane and then Camera Planet or something like that.
[03:37:07.981 --> 03:37:15.989]  You can actually see before the second plane strikes that there is another white plane in restricted airspace prior to the second strike happening.
[03:37:15.989 --> 03:37:17.811]  And this looks a little different from an E-4B.
[03:37:17.811 --> 03:37:25.099]  Although it has a white body, it has two blue wings and blue marking on the tail section.
[03:37:25.529 --> 03:37:29.011]  And this plane is also on the scene of the second crash, and then it flies away.
[03:37:29.011 --> 03:37:33.613]  But according to, you know, the official version, there's no military planes in the air that day.
[03:37:33.613 --> 03:37:35.974]  Well, that's just a lot of hooey.
[03:37:35.974 --> 03:37:43.837]  And besides only that, my friend, there's also redundancy built into the combat readiness of the East Coast.
[03:37:43.837 --> 03:37:46.559]  If the Pentagon gets knocked out, which it was, guess what?
[03:37:46.559 --> 03:37:51.501]  You have the backup at the fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia.
[03:37:52.284 --> 03:37:56.067]  Which basically replicates the Naval Command Center that's in the Pentagon.
[03:37:56.067 --> 03:37:57.888]  So there's redundancy built into there.
[03:37:57.888 --> 03:38:03.672]  And meanwhile, they're running these drills at a Cheyenne Mountain, and I've got the audio tapes of NORAD.
[03:38:03.672 --> 03:38:04.433]  Yeah, listen to it.
[03:38:04.433 --> 03:38:11.478]  Yeah, after Flight 93 has went down, they're calling up Cheyenne Mountain and saying, hey, stop the inputs.
[03:38:11.478 --> 03:38:13.840]  We can't tell what the real attacks are.
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:14.881]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:38:14.881 --> 03:38:20.725]  And finally, my friend, and let's put it this way, if they're trying to tell us the best picture they could get on the Pentagon,
[03:38:21.149 --> 03:38:21.549]  I'm with you.
[03:38:21.549 --> 03:38:23.849]  Thank you so much for the call, Craig.
[03:38:23.849 --> 03:38:25.330]  Let's move on to Mark in Georgia.
[03:38:25.330 --> 03:38:26.110]  Mark, you're live on the air.
[03:38:51.761 --> 03:38:52.241]  Hey, bro!
[03:38:52.241 --> 03:38:53.802]  How you doing, man?
[03:38:53.802 --> 03:38:54.803]  It's been a while.
[03:38:54.803 --> 03:39:04.968]  Listen, uh, the one thing I remember, uh, back in the 90s, uh, Dr. Paul Martin gave a presentation at a cult awareness conference.
[03:39:04.968 --> 03:39:08.790]  He was explaining these are the tactics of manipulation and mind control.
[03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:13.213]  By the way, brainwashing is specific to people that are held against their will.
[03:39:13.213 --> 03:39:17.455]  I know that's a, uh, perhaps a minor technicality.
[03:39:17.455 --> 03:39:20.316]  I'm pulling over here so you can hear me more clearly.
[03:39:20.316 --> 03:39:20.957]  And the thing is,
[03:39:22.138 --> 03:39:26.920]  What he explained is that one of the major tactics is called loaded language.
[03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:36.423]  That is to say, a term or phrase that has a strong emotional charge attached to it that obstructs people from thinking.
[03:39:36.423 --> 03:39:38.843]  You mean like, conspiracy theorist?
[03:39:38.843 --> 03:39:40.984]  No, that's one of my, that's one of the major ones.
[03:39:40.984 --> 03:39:49.487]  The other one, and I tried at the Georgia State GOP convention, I tried to go on record about this, and people were booing us.
[03:39:50.154 --> 03:39:52.456]  The other one is the word terrorist.
[03:39:52.456 --> 03:40:10.667]  It's not like these people are human beings with God-given rights who have been provoked to fight against us using whatever means are at their disposal, but they're not following the Geneva Convention in terms of having some kind of marking that can be seen from a distance.
[03:40:10.667 --> 03:40:13.909]  Kind of like the French Marquis during the Nazi occupation of France.
[03:40:15.208 --> 03:40:18.829]  They're not wearing something that says, hey, I'm the Maquis, come shoot me.
[03:40:18.829 --> 03:40:21.931]  You know, it's like, uh, they're resisting as they can.
[03:40:21.931 --> 03:40:34.695]  And the thing is, that we call them terrorists to avoid dealing with the moral implications of if somebody else tried to do to us what we've been doing to them, people would stand up and fight against them.
[03:40:34.695 --> 03:40:41.358]  And, uh, you know, that's one thing I really respect about Dr. Ron Paul, the only one who's applied the golden rule of
[03:40:42.156 --> 03:40:43.437]  What if the roles were reversed?
[03:40:43.437 --> 03:40:46.779]  What if somebody else tried to do to us what we've been doing?
[03:40:46.779 --> 03:40:48.821]  Would that be morally acceptable?
[03:40:48.821 --> 03:40:53.684]  And, um, well, you see, it concerns me because it's like good cop, bad cop.
[03:40:53.684 --> 03:41:08.635]  Sometimes, if you can explain to people, this is the tactic by which you're being manipulated, the trick is to re-engage people's critical thinking skills and to help them realize that, no, we're not saying that everyone in the government is party to this.
[03:41:08.635 --> 03:41:11.157]  We're saying elements high up in the government
[03:41:11.790 --> 03:41:17.473]  And they're cronies, and they're lackeys, and they're dupes, and they're people who, you know, were compartmentalized.
[03:41:17.473 --> 03:41:27.819]  And that's the thing is that, you know, it's like, um, first, uh, first, uh, test everything and hold fast to that which is good or true.
[03:41:27.819 --> 03:41:31.261]  And, you know, it's good to know what's true even when the truth is not good.
[03:41:31.261 --> 03:41:38.145]  You can't, but I try to explain that to some people who profess to be Christians because it's like,
[03:41:38.755 --> 03:41:43.758]  We have an arrogant attitude of, well, there's one standard for us and a different standard for them.
[03:41:45.423 --> 03:41:47.464]  You know, people need to snap out of it.
[03:41:47.464 --> 03:41:49.626]  Yeah, well, Mark, it's all about dehumanization.
[03:41:49.626 --> 03:41:59.753]  It's about labeling them as terrorists, as non-humans, so when we bomb their entire village and we kill civilians, children, women, it's okay because we hit a terrorist base.
[03:41:59.753 --> 03:42:04.856]  It's just like when Clinton went in with cruise missile strikes against the Sudan.
[03:42:04.856 --> 03:42:06.837]  He said he was going after bin Laden.
[03:42:06.837 --> 03:42:10.020]  In reality, they bomb the largest aspirin factory.
[03:42:10.660 --> 03:42:12.080]  Uh, in that country.
[03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:17.001]  And it doesn't really, it doesn't really mesh with the American people because they were told that they were bombing terrorists.
[03:42:17.001 --> 03:42:18.542]  I thank you for the call.
[03:42:18.542 --> 03:42:19.062]  It's right.
[03:42:19.062 --> 03:42:22.542]  I mean, it's a different set of rules for a different set of folks.
[03:42:22.542 --> 03:42:26.323]  And because they tell you it's a terrorist, they're not a human being to you.
[03:42:26.323 --> 03:42:31.864]  It doesn't even click that this is somebody's brother, sister, mother, family member.
[03:42:31.864 --> 03:42:36.985]  You know, this is somebody that has the same emotions as you and I. They're human beings.
[03:42:36.985 --> 03:42:39.066]  All right, let's go to Steve in Texas.
[03:42:39.066 --> 03:42:39.726]  Steve, are you with us?
[03:42:40.290 --> 03:42:40.710]  Yes, sir.
[03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:42.311]  Good afternoon, Jason.
[03:42:42.311 --> 03:42:44.773]  I appreciate the work you've done with Loose Change.
[03:42:44.773 --> 03:42:59.583]  I've pointed a lot of people to that, and all I tell them is it's the definitive documentary about 9-11, and just go look at that and check out the evidence versus the official story, and you draw your own conclusion based on that.
[03:42:59.583 --> 03:43:02.705]  Of course, if you're objective, you're going to draw the right conclusion.
[03:43:02.705 --> 03:43:05.627]  So I appreciate what you guys are doing with that.
[03:43:06.380 --> 03:43:21.685]  I just want to make people aware of some... I've already been in touch with Alex's producer about that, and this is going to, I think, turn out to be one of his biggest interviews ever, but there's a guy, I don't know if you've heard of him, named Scott Loper.
[03:43:21.685 --> 03:43:22.585]  No, I haven't.
[03:43:22.585 --> 03:43:28.027]  Okay, you've heard of Restore the Republic, Aaron Russo's... Sure, sure, I've worked with him for a little bit.
[03:43:28.027 --> 03:43:31.128]  Yeah, they had a conference call last week, and
[03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:38.994]  What this was, was Scott Roper and his lawyer on this call telling his very sad story.
[03:43:38.994 --> 03:43:42.256]  And what he shared is a real travesty of justice.
[03:43:42.256 --> 03:43:47.799]  Just in a nutshell, he'll get to share more when he's actually on, but he was up in Canada living there.
[03:43:47.799 --> 03:43:49.159]  He'd married a Canadian woman.
[03:43:49.159 --> 03:43:50.920]  He was an American citizen.
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:52.741]  He was a police officer from New Jersey.
[03:43:52.741 --> 03:43:55.563]  He moved up there in Ontario, Canada.
[03:43:55.563 --> 03:43:59.425]  Anyway, he ended up doing a private investigation of his own for the drugs
[03:43:59.955 --> 03:44:03.177]  And the prostitution that the police there were running.
[03:44:03.177 --> 03:44:11.382]  Well, they came down on him, and he uses the term arrested, but really what they did was abducted him as well as his wife and his daughter.
[03:44:11.382 --> 03:44:17.225]  And the bottom line is, he has not seen his three-year-old son since 2000 when this took place.
[03:44:17.225 --> 03:44:24.529]  They kept him against his will for four years in solitary confinement, and they tortured him.
[03:44:24.529 --> 03:44:29.092]  And he goes into detail about this, but I mean, what they did to him is horrendous.
[03:44:29.502 --> 03:44:40.829]  But the worst thing is, when they finally released him four years later in 2004, they dumped him on the American side of the border in my hometown of Buffalo, New York, with just the clothes on his back.
[03:44:40.829 --> 03:44:45.472]  He got back to New Jersey, contacted his congressman, they got in touch with the State Department.
[03:44:45.472 --> 03:44:46.752]  Here's the bottom line.
[03:44:46.752 --> 03:44:56.498]  This year, you probably heard, there's this guy, Madeline, that's an illegal Mexican that in 1993 was convicted for the brutal rape and murder of two women here in the Houston area.
[03:44:56.498 --> 03:44:57.599]  Bush just came out,
[03:44:58.092 --> 03:45:05.978]  Stopping the execution of this guy who was on death row, citing the Vienna Convention, because he didn't get to contact the Mexican consulate.
[03:45:05.978 --> 03:45:18.387]  And yet here, the State Department has given absolutely no help to this man, who's a legal citizen, and has done nothing wrong, and they're basically telling him, forget about your son, he's probably dead.
[03:45:18.387 --> 03:45:25.332]  And so they've turned a blind eye, and the bigger picture of this, as far as restoring the Republic, is the North American Union.
[03:45:25.774 --> 03:45:28.976]  As well as people traveling out of the country from America.
[03:45:28.976 --> 03:45:32.238]  And so I'm hoping people will go to WorldNetDaily.
[03:45:32.238 --> 03:45:35.020]  There's actually four or eight articles about this on there.
[03:45:35.020 --> 03:45:37.201]  He's got documentation to back all this up.
[03:45:37.201 --> 03:45:42.304]  But they're saying there's not even a record of this man in Canada, which is a total lie.
[03:45:42.304 --> 03:45:43.945]  And our government knows about this.
[03:45:43.945 --> 03:45:45.626]  And I'm really upset about this.
[03:45:45.626 --> 03:45:46.167]  All right, Steve.
[03:45:46.167 --> 03:45:46.947]  Well, we'll check it out.
[03:45:46.947 --> 03:45:47.948]  I hope they do get him on.
[03:45:47.948 --> 03:45:49.269]  That is an incredible story.
[03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:50.369]  And check him out.
[03:45:50.369 --> 03:45:51.470]  WorldNetDaily is a...
[03:45:51.923 --> 03:45:53.565]  It's a source I use in some of my films.
[03:45:53.565 --> 03:45:55.686]  It's one of the better websites out there.
[03:45:55.686 --> 03:45:56.868]  Thank you for the call, Steve.
[03:45:56.868 --> 03:45:58.969]  Alright, let's go to Graham in Seattle.
[03:45:58.969 --> 03:46:00.231]  Graham, are you with us?
[03:46:00.231 --> 03:46:02.132]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:46:02.132 --> 03:46:13.102]  So, I was going to tell you, you were talking about the mural that was painted on the side of the flatbed truck, depicting the remote-controlled airplane flying into New York City.
[03:46:14.262 --> 03:46:21.264]  Um, and I found, uh, there was actually an article that Steve Watson had written, uh, last year, April 23rd, uh, 2007.
[03:46:21.264 --> 03:46:34.887]  It's called The Mystery of the 9-11 Car Bombs, and he references Channel 30 NYC, one of the emergency communications channels, on the morning of September 11th, where the first responder actually directly makes reference to, uh,
[03:46:35.712 --> 03:46:52.773]  A message about the remote-controlled plane and he talks about how there's a big truck with a mural painted of an airplane diving into New York City and exploding and then they were calling for the bomb people to come over there and so that was pretty interesting.
[03:46:52.773 --> 03:46:55.036]  We played that audio on the show yesterday by the way.
[03:46:55.888 --> 03:46:57.508]  Oh, did you play that audio?
[03:46:57.508 --> 03:47:16.712]  Yeah, if you want to actually hear that audio, there's a great article over at TruthAlliance.net where somebody goes through that entire conversation and on Google Maps, on Google Video, he kind of takes you where these things are happening and that happened on King Street between 6th and 7th, and then there's a... Yeah, 6th and 7th on King Street.
[03:47:16.712 --> 03:47:18.712]  Yeah, it says that in this article that I'm looking at too.
[03:47:18.712 --> 03:47:21.613]  It also has the audio on the Steve Watson article.
[03:47:22.304 --> 03:47:29.889]  You were talking to the We Are Change person earlier about the... he had mentioned the Norman Mineta in the 2006 report.
[03:47:29.889 --> 03:47:36.473]  I think it was the Norman Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Study report.
[03:47:36.473 --> 03:47:37.294]  I believe so, too.
[03:47:37.294 --> 03:47:39.435]  In February of 2006.
[03:47:39.435 --> 03:47:47.000]  That reference, it's kind of interesting that they found it to be just an innocent delivery truck, even though it had a painting of a plane flying into the world.
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:50.022]  And Middle Easterners who couldn't speak English that didn't own it.
[03:47:50.700 --> 03:47:56.386]  Yeah, and it's kind of interesting because the actual first responders reported that it exploded.
[03:47:56.386 --> 03:47:58.688]  Well, one of the things, I don't know if that one exploded.
[03:47:58.688 --> 03:48:06.476]  I think that they're talking about another van, because I'm listening to these things for the first time in the past couple days, and I've only listened to them about four or five times.
[03:48:06.776 --> 03:48:19.308]  But I do think that's a separate incident because they say that they have those guys in custody and that the flatbed truck had been pulled over and then they're talking about this other explosion that may have been one of those urban moving systems vans.
[03:48:19.308 --> 03:48:26.976]  I gotta jump, but I thank you for the call, Graham, and it's definitely an area of interest for me and one that really needs to be looked into.
[03:48:26.976 --> 03:48:29.398]  Let's go to Kenny in Wisconsin.
[03:48:29.398 --> 03:48:30.019]  Kenny, are you with us?
[03:48:30.396 --> 03:48:32.616]  Yeah, Jason, Trucker Kenny here.
[03:48:32.616 --> 03:48:34.277]  I want to ask you something.
[03:48:34.277 --> 03:48:39.798]  If you recall, I think a couple of years ago, there was an interview.
[03:48:39.798 --> 03:48:43.859]  I know the guy's first name is Rick, but I don't know his last name.
[03:48:43.859 --> 03:48:52.000]  He was interviewing Dr. Taganya Koreshnev, Vladimir Putin's right-hand girl.
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:52.920]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:53.680]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:48:53.680 --> 03:48:54.521]  Are you aware of that?
[03:48:54.521 --> 03:48:56.581]  No, I'm not aware of that, so please enlighten me.
[03:48:57.057 --> 03:49:02.561]  Okay, well, going through an interpreter, this Rick, and I wish I knew his last name.
[03:49:02.561 --> 03:49:05.844]  Maybe one of the callers will remember.
[03:49:05.844 --> 03:49:12.889]  She indicated in the interview that 9-11 was two years, at least, in the planning.
[03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:22.516]  And at the closing of the interview, she says that terrorists wear $2,000 Armani suits and ride around in limousines in Washington.
[03:49:22.516 --> 03:49:24.218]  I will leave it at that.
[03:49:25.518 --> 03:49:27.621]  And thanks for taking my call, Jason.
[03:49:27.621 --> 03:49:28.682]  All right, thank you, Kenny.
[03:49:28.682 --> 03:49:29.463]  I'll look into it.
[03:49:29.463 --> 03:49:35.311]  But yeah, I mean, the real terrorists are the ones in the three-piece suits, and then they have their little drug runners and their little ops.
[03:49:35.311 --> 03:49:37.634]  I mean, look at Muhammad Ata.
[03:49:37.634 --> 03:49:38.615]  Never hurting for money.
[03:49:39.315 --> 03:49:43.499]  Down in strip clubs, doing blow, drinking alcohol.
[03:49:43.499 --> 03:49:51.327]  This is the same guy that's on a plane with four other guys dressed in jumpsuits on a plane with James Woods.
[03:49:51.327 --> 03:49:55.291]  And James Woods is so spooked that they're going to actually hijack the aircraft.
[03:49:55.291 --> 03:49:57.434]  He pulls one of the stewardesses aside.
[03:49:57.434 --> 03:50:02.259]  He expresses his concerns, then watches them the entire time they're on the plane.
[03:50:02.699 --> 03:50:06.361]  Then they both get off the plane and they file separate FAA reports.
[03:50:06.361 --> 03:50:08.543]  Now, he's been on O'Reilly talking about this.
[03:50:08.543 --> 03:50:09.964]  This is prior to 9-11.
[03:50:09.964 --> 03:50:10.924]  The FAA does nothing.
[03:50:10.924 --> 03:50:11.805]  Why do they do nothing?
[03:50:11.805 --> 03:50:13.386]  Because they're told it's a drill!
[03:50:14.181 --> 03:50:15.721]  These guys work for the government.
[03:50:15.721 --> 03:50:17.402]  Maybe not all of them.
[03:50:17.402 --> 03:50:21.523]  But you better know that Atta had all sorts of government ties.
[03:50:21.523 --> 03:50:23.804]  Trained at Maxwell Air Force Base, folks.
[03:50:23.804 --> 03:50:24.804]  There's no debating it.
[03:50:24.804 --> 03:50:26.444]  We have the FOIA request.
[03:50:26.444 --> 03:50:29.986]  Well, that's A Muhammad Atta, not THE Muhammad Atta.
[03:50:29.986 --> 03:50:30.706]  Give me a break.
[03:50:30.706 --> 03:50:31.886]  Final segment on the other side.
[03:50:31.886 --> 03:50:33.006]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:33.006 --> 03:50:34.027]  We'll be taking your calls.
[03:50:34.027 --> 03:50:35.027]  I am Jason Bermas.
[03:50:47.372 --> 03:50:53.457]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[03:50:53.457 --> 03:50:59.402]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[03:50:59.402 --> 03:51:03.545]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[03:51:03.545 --> 03:51:08.449]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:51:08.709 --> 03:51:17.212]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[03:54:00.979 --> 03:54:01.879]  It truly is the end.
[03:54:01.879 --> 03:54:16.325]  If you missed any of the Alex Jones Show, especially that first hour where we had Alex and Jim Tucker reporting from Chantilly, Virginia, the Bilderberg Conference, where the mainstream media dare not go but to attend.
[03:54:17.120 --> 03:54:18.341]  Yeah, can I speak off the air?
[03:54:45.831 --> 03:54:46.872]  So you want to do that?
[03:54:46.872 --> 03:54:47.413]  Hold him.
[03:54:47.413 --> 03:54:48.273]  All right.
[03:54:48.273 --> 03:54:50.616]  Let's go to Wilson in Texas.
[03:54:50.616 --> 03:54:51.957]  Wilson, are you with us?
[03:54:51.957 --> 03:54:53.098]  Yes.
[03:54:53.098 --> 03:54:54.339]  What can I do for you today, sir?
[03:54:54.339 --> 03:54:55.020]  Sure.
[03:54:55.020 --> 03:54:56.421]  Jason, three or four things, man.
[03:54:56.421 --> 03:55:01.186]  You used to be able to get to Final Cut through LaughingPond.com.
[03:55:01.186 --> 03:55:02.067]  That's shut down, right?
[03:55:03.513 --> 03:55:04.454]  Uh, I don't know.
[03:55:04.454 --> 03:55:06.536]  I have no idea about the LaughingPond.com.
[03:55:06.536 --> 03:55:14.003]  I think that, I think I've seen it posted, but if you go to, uh, video.google.com, you type in, uh, Loose Change Final Cut, you should be able to find it.
[03:55:14.003 --> 03:55:16.906]  Or, uh, you can just type in Loose Change into Google.
[03:55:16.906 --> 03:55:20.309]  The first thing that'll come up is the second edition, the one that I've posted.
[03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:26.876]  And then, if you just go into More from User section, which is right next to the video, you can easily navigate to Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:55:27.662 --> 03:55:27.842]  Cool.
[03:55:27.842 --> 03:55:30.626]  Well, Laughing Pond used to be a free link to it.
[03:55:30.626 --> 03:55:33.870]  I think somebody else, maybe you didn't even know about it.
[03:55:33.870 --> 03:55:35.051]  Enemies have shut it down.
[03:55:35.051 --> 03:55:45.184]  But another one of the points I wanted to make, in Midwest City, Oklahoma City suburb, they just had a warrantless traffic search on Monday.
[03:55:46.135 --> 03:55:51.902]  And all of the people that were interviewed from Channel 4 were talking about, oh, well, this is a good thing.
[03:55:51.902 --> 03:55:57.488]  Well, it's great that we don't have a Fourth Amendment and they can just pull you over and say, oh, it looks like you don't have your seatbelt on.
[03:55:57.488 --> 03:55:59.010]  Or, oh, is there contraband in your car?
[03:55:59.010 --> 03:56:00.231]  Can we search your car?
[03:56:00.231 --> 03:56:02.353]  Yeah, it's the end of America, man.
[03:56:02.353 --> 03:56:02.874]  Exactly.
[03:56:04.025 --> 03:56:05.086]  But I have a clip of that.
[03:56:05.086 --> 03:56:08.529]  I sent Aaron at InfoWars and I haven't heard anybody talk about that yet.
[03:56:08.529 --> 03:56:08.950]  You know why?
[03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:12.573]  It's probably just because Aaron has been running around like crazy.
[03:56:12.573 --> 03:56:16.037]  He's got like five different jobs just to get this Bilderberg meeting.
[03:56:16.037 --> 03:56:23.024]  Anybody who's sending in stories right now, I just want to let you know these guys are going to be gone for the entire week and I would try again on the Monday around.
[03:56:23.024 --> 03:56:24.005]  I thank you for the call, Wilson.
[03:56:24.005 --> 03:56:24.645]  I got to jump.
[03:56:24.645 --> 03:56:26.767]  Let's go to Tony in Illinois.
[03:56:26.767 --> 03:56:27.428]  Tony, are you with us?
[03:56:29.028 --> 03:56:31.370]  Yeah, Jason, not a lot of time left.
[03:56:31.370 --> 03:56:37.334]  Getting back to the Pentagon, the telephone poles, the most peculiar thing.
[03:56:37.334 --> 03:56:42.797]  How does five telephone poles get knocked down on that highway if it wasn't a large jet busting them down?
[03:56:42.797 --> 03:56:45.639]  Well, this is my big problem with the telephone poles.
[03:56:45.639 --> 03:56:50.182]  If it was a large jet that cut through that, I do think you have to account for the telephone poles.
[03:56:50.182 --> 03:56:51.003]  The light poles?
[03:56:51.003 --> 03:56:52.264]  Yeah, the light poles.
[03:56:53.184 --> 03:56:55.927]  Where are the pieces of wing that would have shattered?
[03:56:55.927 --> 03:56:59.431]  I mean, you're going through five separate ones, some of which were cut in half.
[03:56:59.431 --> 03:57:01.213]  They weren't just knocked over, okay?
[03:57:01.213 --> 03:57:06.119]  Now, normally when a plane hits something like that, it's very obstructed.
[03:57:06.119 --> 03:57:11.985]  You would have thought that the plane would have hit the lawn of the Pentagon, crashed into the ground, lost control.
[03:57:11.985 --> 03:57:14.188]  I mean, we're talking about 500 plus miles an hour.
[03:57:14.648 --> 03:57:14.948]  I don't know.
[03:57:30.899 --> 03:57:36.924]  than your standard plane that was able to resist or just go fast enough where it was able to cut through those.
[03:57:36.924 --> 03:57:38.425]  I don't have an answer for you, man.
[03:57:38.425 --> 03:57:42.068]  I mean, again, you know, loose change final cut tries to handle all the angles.
[03:57:42.068 --> 03:57:44.010]  I'm sorry we can't go to Art in Kansas.
[03:57:44.010 --> 03:57:46.312]  We just took the last caller.
[03:57:46.312 --> 03:57:52.737]  Guys, the retransmission starts in less than 60 seconds over at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:52.737 --> 03:57:54.078]  I am Jason Burmess.

[03:57:55.520 --> 03:57:58.222]  We're going to have more from Alex Jones and the Bilderberg Group.

[03:58:40.653 --> 03:58:41.594]  In the near future.
[03:58:42.463 --> 03:58:45.545]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[03:58:45.545 --> 03:58:48.368]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:58:48.368 --> 03:58:51.150]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:58:51.150 --> 03:58:54.332]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:58:54.332 --> 03:59:01.658]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:59:04.690 --> 03:59:10.133]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[03:59:13.995 --> 03:59:16.576]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:59:16.576 --> 03:59:17.736]  Most people have no idea.
[03:59:17.736 --> 03:59:18.517]  They're not after money.
[03:59:18.517 --> 03:59:19.778]  They have all the money they need.
[03:59:19.778 --> 03:59:20.778]  They're after power.
[03:59:20.778 --> 03:59:21.919]  That's what they're after, you see.
[03:59:21.919 --> 03:59:26.101]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com
