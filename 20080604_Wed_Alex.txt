[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  the media.
[00:02.000 --> 00:03.000]  Government cover-ups.
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.000]  Do you want answers?
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  I am not Alex Jones, I'm Jason Bermont.
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  I was studying in the rest of the week.
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.000]  Alex, however, has huge breakthroughs
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  from the Builderburg Conference.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  He will be calling in the first hour.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  I can't wait.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  I talked to him briefly this morning.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  And a lot of stuff coming up.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  He's being hustled out of that hotel right now.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  They're preparing for the elite to come in
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  to their annual meeting,
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  where they will discuss geopolitics
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  and decide what's good for you and me.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  And it doesn't necessarily have to be good, folks.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  We're also going to have a few guests on the show today,
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  of course, this Wednesday, June 4th, 2008.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  We're going to have Adam Cunnington of Kentucky We Are Changed.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  Jonathan Elanoff of We Are Changed Colorado.
[01:04.000 --> 01:12.000]  Daniel Estalon, of course, the author of a book we carry over at infowars.com
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  on the Builderburg Group.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  And of course, he's an end game with Jim Tucker.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  We had Jim Tucker on yesterday.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  And Alex will be joining us for the full third hour, I believe.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  So hopefully Alex is going to call in in the first hour.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  We're going to take calls in the first hour as well.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  And I might even give a call to Blair Gadsby after the break.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  Blair is the man who is basically on a hunger strike right now
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  to talk to John McCain.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  Now, I am no fan of John McCain.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  John McCain, of course, wrote the forward to popular mechanics book,
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Debunking 9-11 Myths.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  And we're going to read an excerpt out of that.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  But the Arizona Central is, I'm sorry, the Arizona Republic newspaper out there
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  is finally reporting on this on a pretty non slanted manner.
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  I've heard conspiracy theorists, whack jobs.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  They leave that rhetoric out of this article.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  And I'm going to read it for you right now.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  An Arizona State Senator is petitioning presumptive GOP presidential nominee
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  John McCain to meet with 9-11 conspiracy theorists.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  I guess they do throw out conspiracy theorists in the beginning.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  Including an adjunct professor from Scottsdale,
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  who has been fasting outside McCain's office for more than a week.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  State Senator Karen Johnson, a Mesa Republican,
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  she's been on this show, by the way,
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  delivered a letter to McCain's Senate office Tuesday
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  asking her to sit down with Scottsdale activist Blair Gadsby
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  and a pair of leading members of the 9-11 Truth Movement
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  to consider alternative explanations for the September 11, 2001 attacks
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  Gadsby's fast outside McCain's Senate office
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  entered its 10th day today. Wow.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  I can't imagine not eating for 10 days.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  I think I've gotten, what, a day and a half, two days without eating?
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  And that was because I was sick.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  10 days? Godspeed, man.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  There are so many questions left on answers, said Johnson,
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  who called for a new independent investigation into the attacks.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  She had previously been focused on media attention
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  for her vocal misgivings about the government account of 9-11.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  Again, Tuesday, she said, there's no explanation,
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  no legitimate explanation about why the towers
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  in Building 7 came down.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  Folks, it's a 10,000-page report by NIST,
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  commissioned by the government, in which they don't even tell you
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  how the towers collapsed.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  They try to explain away collapse initiation.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  Okay, let's say it again, collapse initiation,
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  and then they say that global collapse ensues.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  When John Gross of NIST was confronted about this
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  and asked about the molten metal,
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  he denied the molten metal that was under 1, 2, and 7.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  Plenty eyewitnesses' accounts.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Check out Loose Change Final Cut. They're in there.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  And he denied any knowledge of the NASA thermal imagery
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  that showed these extreme hotspots.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  I don't know anything about that.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  Oh, why don't you email it to me? That sounds good.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  Now, the person asking him this is a professor at the college
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  that he's speaking at.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  So this professor goes and approaches Mr. Gross afterwards
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  and he says, can I get that email so I can send you these NASA thermal imagery?
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  No, I'm not interested. Thanks.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  I just said that because I was in front of a group of kids.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  So let's see if we can get Blair Gatsby on the line,
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  10 days without food for 9-Eleven Truth, folks.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  That's pretty hardcore.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show. Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Remember, Alex is down in D.C. at Bilderberg.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  He's going to be calling in. We'll be back after this.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning,
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  and the poisoning of your entire system
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  are totally unnecessary?
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die,
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  with laced med inks, patented methodology.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Laser technology at its best.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  For more information, call 702-953-0267
[05:41.000 --> 05:49.000]  or visit www.LASEMEDINC.com.
[05:49.000 --> 06:16.000]  Call 702-953-0267.
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.000]  Or you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  We've got the most well-researched and documented titles,
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  all available at PrismPlanet.com.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  Or if you'd like, you can give the info or store a call
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  at 888-253-3139.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  Or you can view more than a thousand titles
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  in super high quality right now at PrismPlanet.tv.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Knowledge is power, and the information you need
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  to effectively wake up your fellow man
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  and fight the New World Order is available right now
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  at truthnews.us and prismplanet.tv.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  Join the info war today.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  Are you concerned about cholesterol, blood pressure?
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Are you looking for a more natural method
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  to help improve your health issues?
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  My husband has had lots of blood pressure problems today.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  It would just be really high that doctor had worked with him
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  and he'd give him some medication for a little while.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  It would maybe work, and then it wouldn't.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  He was going back and forth, and my husband's not the doctor
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  that he wants to go to the doctor anyway.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  He'll wait till he is in major problems.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  So, a friend gave us a bottle of cardivate,
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  and he started on it within a very short time.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  I'm going to say two weeks at the most.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  It was just leveling out, and as long as he's been on these,
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  it has literally saved his life.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  To learn more, call 1-877-928-8822
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P.com.
[07:48.000 --> 08:17.000]  Call 1-877-928-8822.
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.000]  Talk 9-11 Truth.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  I really don't think Mr. McCain has really looked into the matter
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  other than his basic rhetoric against Middle Eastern terrorists.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  This is the same guy who joked around and saying,
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, I ran.
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  I want to remind people that Alex will be checking in all day long
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  from D.C. and the Bilderberg conference.
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  I am Jason Bermas.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  You can check out my little website at loosechange911.com.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  All right, let's go to Blair.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  Blair, how did you come up with this idea?
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  And by the way, I can only commend you.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  I mean, I can't imagine fasting for 10 days.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  Yeah, it's not something I've ever done before,
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  but it sure is good to be here talking to you.
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  How did I come up with it?
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.000]  Good question.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  I think it was somewhat of a spontaneous idea
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  in that there's a convergence of issues.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  First of all, McCain's rather sudden rise to the top of the ticket
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  and to the top of the nominee here.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  And the fact I'm an Arizona citizen or resident
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  and the fact that he wrote this forward to this book.
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  And I thought, well, this is an interesting confluence of events here.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  I wonder if that would give me any leverage to approach him
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  and ask him about just what side of this issue is he on
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  regarding the official 9-11 cover story.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  Absolutely.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  And in Alex's upcoming film, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising,
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  one of the family members, someone I know personally,
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  Dave Cahill, he's a musician.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  You can go check his stuff out on MySpace.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  But he asks him in light of the fact that many family members
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  want a new investigation and don't feel that their questions were answered.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  In fact, 70% of their questions were unanswered.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Would you support a new 9-11 investigation?
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  And McCain just poo-poo's it and says,
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  oh, I think that they did a bang-up job
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  and the family members are quite satisfied.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  And let me just read a little excerpt from what he wrote in that forward
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  to debunking 9-11 myths.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  Why conspiracy theories can't stand up to the facts.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  He says, we cannot let these tales go unanswered yet.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  He doesn't say what these tales are.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  9-11 conspiracy movement exploits.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Now we're exploiting people, folks.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  The public's anger and sadness.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  No, I think that was the mainstream media and the mainline government
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  that exploited the public's anger and sadness
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  in order to invade two sovereign nations.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  But I guess that's just me.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  Traffics in ugly, unfounded accusations.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  Of course, he hasn't looked at these accusations.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Or he would know they're more than founded.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  Of extraordinary evil against fellow Americans.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  Hmm.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Now, I can ask you a little bit.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  Yeah, it's very odd.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  What brought you into 9-11 truth?
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  What was the overwhelming piece of evidence that you just said,
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  you know what, this story's not adding up.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  I better look into this.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  These people might have something here.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  It built really when,
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  I mean, initially when they came out and said,
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  they hate us because we are free.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  That's why they attacked us.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Well, this is preposterous.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  How do you, how is hate generated in someone's heart?
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Because somebody else has freedom.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  I could be envy, but not hate.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  So as a religious studies professor,
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  and I even teach a course on Islam
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  and the other world religions,
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  I mean, this was obviously a distortion,
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  to say the least.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  Now, that was early on in the media,
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  but that certainly was not a 9-11 truth
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  or if you will, at that point.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  In early 2003, in reading Gordy Dole's book,
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  he made the suggestion,
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  I think it was perpetual war for perpetual peace,
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  or his dreaming war.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  All right, Blair, can I just get you to hold?
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  I'm sorry, man, but I have Alex on the line.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  He wants to come on right now.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  Can you hold over till the next segment?
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  I can, sure.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  All right, thank you so much, Blair.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  All right, let's go right to Alex Jones
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  from D.C. Bilderberg Conference,
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  2008. Alex, are you with us?
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Yeah, Jason, don't interrupt.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  I told you I was going to call at this time.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  I'm all about it, sir.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  How are things going?
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  All right, so it's Sunday in the West Spoons.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  But, literally, as we speak,
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  I have security people following me.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  I have questions.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  You pull anywhere that jump all over you.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  Get in your face.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  And they don't even start arriving
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  until tomorrow morning, but older advanced teams
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  were here last night.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  Of course, we're standing nearby
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  and also got a room here
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  to work in tomorrow morning.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  We're here
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  covering everything that's happening
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.400]  happening. And so it's very important everybody understands that the decisions
[12:36.400 --> 12:41.640]  that are going to be made here the few days will probably govern whether they
[12:41.640 --> 12:49.360]  attack or not. We know that every 50 years, every five years in North
[12:49.360 --> 13:00.120]  America, two years ago in Ottawa. Now they're back here in DC, Kenya. Most experts,
[13:00.120 --> 13:04.160]  including Jim Tucker, who I talked about this morning, he's not staying here, but
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.760]  he just arrived and he's inside. I'm now eating lunch. We're gonna help some more.
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.800]  But all the experts agree that the fact that they're meeting here means that
[13:14.800 --> 13:18.520]  war, if you look at it from the table, we don't know if we're going to play that
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.760]  card. They're gonna play that card. If the United States is going to be sucked
[13:22.760 --> 13:29.680]  into it and be drugged back into it and more tyrant. This is so important. They
[13:29.680 --> 13:34.840]  met here, of course, in 2002. It's a very little and I'm standing in front of
[13:34.840 --> 13:40.360]  right here in front of main entrance. And the fact that they're meeting here
[13:40.360 --> 13:44.480]  again, you later learn some of the minutes that got leaked in some of our
[13:44.480 --> 13:48.400]  sources and it turned out to be accurate intelligence. It always does when it
[13:48.400 --> 13:52.480]  comes from Jim. In fact, I've never seen Jim be wrong. So other people be right
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.040]  about 90% of the time, 95% of the time, Jim is always, and in 2002, he came on my
[13:57.040 --> 14:07.200]  show during the meeting here in Chantilly and said that the fact that
[14:07.200 --> 14:17.520]  he had met here and that his intelligence had of him, that I'm going to be
[14:17.520 --> 14:30.280]  attacking in March of that year, but that would be in 2003 in March. That would
[14:30.280 --> 14:33.440]  be correct. I've got people watching me walk around. That's why I'm bubbling a
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.400]  little bit here. But just to be clear on my report, I'm talking to others who
[14:37.400 --> 14:40.920]  said that the fact that they're meeting here in D.C. only two years after
[14:40.920 --> 14:45.680]  meeting in North America, the fact that they met here to plan the Iraq War in
[14:45.680 --> 14:53.360]  2002, for March of 2003 shows that the War Council meeting that they are having
[14:53.360 --> 14:59.600]  here, really clear. I met Bill, or 2008, they shot the hotel down. They said we
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.800]  have to be out in the morning. I'll be surprised. We've got to find out before
[15:04.800 --> 15:13.640]  then there are much better than I saw. Even in Ottawa, where I saw it, and the
[15:13.640 --> 15:16.680]  leaders haven't even arrived, their advanced teams are here. If you try to
[15:16.680 --> 15:19.480]  go in there, the conference rooms or any other areas where they're setting up,
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.520]  there's people guarding. You broke up for a second there, Alex. Do you say that
[15:23.520 --> 15:27.800]  there was twice as much security at this than it was two years ago? Yes, it's
[15:27.800 --> 15:32.400]  just coming in clear. Am I coming in clear now? Yeah, yeah. Okay, let me give you
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.200]  some people just a clear report from the start. I am here at Bilderberg, 2008, in
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.040]  Chantilly, Virginia, at the Westfields Marriott Hotel. The last time they met
[15:42.040 --> 15:47.000]  here was in 2002, and accurate leaks that were then proven to be correct,
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.680]  said that the attack on Iraq would not be in 2002, but that it was going to be
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.280]  happening in March of 2003. The reason that's important is the Washington
[15:57.280 --> 16:00.960]  Post, New York, and everybody else in the mainstream media were reporting that
[16:00.960 --> 16:10.160]  the attack was on in the next few months in Iraq, and told like that, and it
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.880]  didn't happen, and it did happen in March of 2003. The power of Bilderberg
[16:15.880 --> 16:21.960]  showed how they truly do and make decisions. And time and time again,
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.480]  M has been accurate with sources, so it's accurate in their sources. Forecast
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.200]  thing was going to happen here, years, three years, just like they said,
[16:31.200 --> 16:36.200]  they'd be paying dollars a gallon up to two years ago. They said that
[16:36.200 --> 16:41.080]  those we go well above $100 a barrel. Now it's been $105 a barrel for
[16:41.080 --> 16:46.280]  weeks. They showed that these people really knew government, and so we see
[16:46.280 --> 16:53.840]  big shows of Barack Obama. We see big shows going on right now with Hillary
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.640]  Clinton and the rest of it. I know he's the presumptive nominee. None of that
[16:57.640 --> 17:01.800]  anything. People are literally pocket change. It's in their pocket, and we've
[17:01.800 --> 17:07.240]  done a presentation about that show that Barack Obama is being handled,
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.280]  and it's in the Bible, or we hear just about what's been here. This is John
[17:11.280 --> 17:19.920]  McCain is handling control of the very same institutions, and it's just like
[17:19.920 --> 17:25.040]  Otto there at the Brookstreet Hotel. It's surrounded by racing on and
[17:25.040 --> 17:31.400]  Lockheedon, and driving in here was even worse. I saw every major contract for
[17:31.400 --> 17:39.280]  you. Hold on, Alex. You broke up there. You saw, yeah, you saw every major
[17:39.280 --> 17:44.920]  defense contractor. Is that what you said? Go get on the hotel line, and is this
[17:44.920 --> 17:48.640]  the bat cell? It's pretty rough. Yeah, it's pretty rough. It's you've been
[17:48.640 --> 17:51.800]  breaking up in and out, but you were saying that.
[17:51.800 --> 17:55.400]  Everybody disregard this report. When are you going to have the fellow
[17:55.400 --> 17:59.840]  testing off? I just had him call in, and he'll be out after this segment, so.
[17:59.840 --> 18:04.480]  Okay, well, I'll just go in at the tree after, okay? All right, sounds good. Thank
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.640]  you, Alex. There he is. He's at Bilderberg folks, and like he said, double
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.160]  the security. It's days before, got there a little early, spoke about the
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.960]  situation. He's going to be calling back on a landline, so he's a little bit more
[18:15.960 --> 18:20.840]  clear, broke up in and out. All right, let's go back to Blair Gadsby, a religious
[18:20.840 --> 18:25.520]  studies professor. I believe you teach in Scottsdale, Arizona, Blair? That's
[18:25.520 --> 18:29.160]  correct. It may be actually, but it's a sister of colleges here in the
[18:29.160 --> 18:33.120]  Maricopa County, and we were discussing what really will come up, and you
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.560]  said that, you know, just the fact that they said, hate us for our freedoms, got
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.680]  your mind working, but what was it that really pushed you over the ads to check
[18:40.680 --> 18:44.880]  out 9-Eleven Truth? Well, I think then it was a subtle shift over to the so-called
[18:44.880 --> 18:49.120]  Liehop fairy, when Gordy Dahl, as I mentioned in those two weeks, one or
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.120]  other of these two earlier book titles I mentioned, suggested that, well, where
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.240]  was the Air Force that day? It seemed to be somewhat inexplicable that there was
[18:58.240 --> 19:02.520]  no Air Force response, so I think since 2003 had been something of a latent
[19:02.520 --> 19:07.800]  Liehopper. However, it was last year, around May last year, a little over a year,
[19:07.800 --> 19:12.040]  when somebody took me off to loose change, I watched that salt building seven
[19:12.040 --> 19:15.480]  come down, and you know it really all came together thereafter, and I've been a
[19:15.480 --> 19:20.000]  truth or ever since. Yeah, it's really hard to explain how a 47-story skyscraper
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.560]  that holds every intelligence agency under the sun, from the FBI to the largest
[19:24.560 --> 19:29.160]  CIA office outside of DC, to the Secret Service, the largest Secret Service
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.240]  field office in the world, just comes down in a style of control demolition.
[19:33.240 --> 19:37.240]  Blair, I'm gonna have to let you go, but I want to say, you know, keep it up, we're
[19:37.240 --> 19:40.800]  with you, there's a lot of people following this story, you have anything to add at the end?
[19:40.800 --> 19:45.600]  All I can say is just keep the pressure on the media. I'm targeting John McCain,
[19:45.600 --> 19:49.680]  remember, I'm trying to zero in on the fact that I believe he has been deceived by these
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.560]  scientists, and I want to snatch him back from those forces that have pulled him
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.360]  over. Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of
[19:57.360 --> 20:01.520]  gasoline. It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying
[20:01.520 --> 20:05.440]  record prices at the pump. I have run across a company called SFR, who has
[20:05.440 --> 20:09.600]  developed two products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic as
[20:09.600 --> 20:13.760]  much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete fuel system
[20:13.760 --> 20:18.840]  treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one
[20:18.840 --> 20:22.920]  tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends
[20:22.920 --> 20:27.000]  the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.560]  to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95, and
[20:31.560 --> 20:37.120]  receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free. Call triple-8, use
[20:37.120 --> 20:43.480]  SFR-1. That number again is triple-8, use SFR-1, or check them out online at
[20:43.480 --> 20:49.320]  oilcompanysecret.com. That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed, or
[20:49.320 --> 20:53.600]  your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[20:53.600 --> 20:58.120]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet
[20:58.120 --> 21:03.280]  history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new
[21:03.280 --> 21:07.960]  two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change
[21:07.960 --> 21:11.920]  Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[21:11.920 --> 21:15.960]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of
[21:15.960 --> 21:20.080]  the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change Final Cut is the
[21:20.080 --> 21:24.760]  ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to
[21:24.760 --> 21:29.000]  bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.720]  must see. Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com

[21:50.880 --> 21:54.800]  tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[21:54.800 --> 22:00.520]  Ted Enners of Hermit is June 4th, 2008. Gold 883.50 ounce gold coins can be
[22:00.520 --> 22:07.560]  purchased for $909.33, $447.95 for half, $223.98 for quarter. That's $909.33,
[22:07.560 --> 22:14.640]  $447.95, and $223.98. We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster
[22:14.640 --> 22:18.280]  than tax collections. Now the government has published the document that sounds
[22:18.280 --> 22:22.080]  the alarm. That's right, the United States government accountability office, the GAO,
[22:22.080 --> 22:25.920]  has published the long-term fiscal outlook document. Clearly stating that the
[22:25.920 --> 22:29.560]  federal debt burden is spiraling out of control, this will directly affect
[22:29.560 --> 22:34.800]  programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank deposits. Taxation
[22:34.800 --> 22:38.480]  and inflationary printing of the US dollar are inevitable pressures facing the
[22:38.480 --> 22:45.080]  economy. Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237. The US GAO has
[22:45.080 --> 22:52.120]  spelled it out in black and white. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[22:52.120 --> 22:57.920]  Hi, my name is William Lewis, and if you're listening to this radio station,
[22:57.920 --> 23:01.720]  then chances are you've probably seen one or two of the documentaries that I've
[23:01.720 --> 23:07.320]  made over the years. 911 in plain sight, Beyond Treason, or maybe 911 Ripple Effect.
[23:07.320 --> 23:12.160]  And by now you've got to be as angry as I am and wondering what else have they
[23:12.160 --> 23:17.000]  done and what are we gonna do about it. My latest documentary, Washington You're
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.840]  Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change while at the same time exposing
[23:21.840 --> 23:26.000]  the scope of the president's immoral and illegal spy program. We reveal the
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.320]  abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act,
[23:30.320 --> 23:34.680]  and other very intrusive spy bills. Washington You're Fired explores the
[23:34.680 --> 23:39.920]  removal of habeas corpus, posicumatatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of
[23:39.920 --> 23:45.520]  Rights. Join us today at TakeBackWashington.com. Listen to our new radio
[23:45.520 --> 23:49.600]  program, get caught up on current events, and get your copy of Washington You're

[23:55.120 --> 24:07.720]  Alright folks, it's the Alex Jones Show. We are back. We just let Blair Gatsby go.
[24:07.720 --> 24:12.520]  Let's really support him. He's out there in Arizona, 10th day without any food
[24:12.520 --> 24:16.560]  whatsoever in front of McCain's office, just petitioning to talk to the man and
[24:16.560 --> 24:22.120]  try to show him some of this evidence that 911 was indeed an inside job.
[24:22.120 --> 24:28.520]  Building 7 says it all itself. Alex Jones called in. His cell phone was a
[24:28.520 --> 24:31.600]  little shaky, but let's try to recap it a little bit what he said. He said twice
[24:31.600 --> 24:36.680]  as much security as in 2006. He said security has shown up a day before its
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.040]  schedules. He has to be out of the hotel early in the morning. Tomorrow he was
[24:41.040 --> 24:44.560]  obviously very silent. He felt like he was being followed. He talked about
[24:44.560 --> 24:48.160]  defense contractors. He also discussed how the last time it was in Chantilly,
[24:48.160 --> 24:53.880]  Virginia, was in 2002. We discussed that with Jim Tucker yesterday. It really
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.440]  allows for a lot of the upper echelons of the military, of the Washington
[24:59.440 --> 25:05.200]  insiders, of the bureaucrats that run the system, NDC, to come over and stop over
[25:05.200 --> 25:09.640]  for a meeting for only a couple hours. It really allows access. I think this
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.440]  is going to be a big, big Bilderberg meeting. We can't wait for Alex to
[25:15.440 --> 25:18.320]  call back, hopefully on a landline, and give us a little bit better of a report
[25:18.320 --> 25:24.440]  where we can hear every single word that he is saying. That being said, most
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.200]  talk shows would have started out with this info, but I haven't even talked
[25:28.200 --> 25:31.880]  about it yet. We had Mike Rivera on yesterday, and we started to talk about
[25:31.880 --> 25:37.040]  the Democratic nomination for the presidency. He said it looks like
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.560]  Barack Obama. We discussed Hillary Clinton and don't counter out yet, but
[25:41.560 --> 25:48.160]  indeed it looks like it will be Barack Obama today. He is the seemingly, I
[25:48.160 --> 25:53.120]  guess, unopposed at this point nominee for the Democratic Party, but when I went
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.360]  to CNN.com this morning to check out the story, the first spin they put on it,
[25:57.360 --> 26:04.040]  will Hillary vie for the Democratic vice presidential nomination. Now, I have
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.600]  been an advocate that it was going to indeed be a Hillary Obama or an Obama
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.620]  Hillary ticket, and that if it was not that ticket that John Edwards would step
[26:13.620 --> 26:18.240]  in and be the VP for either candidate. I am still sticking by that. I understand
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.840]  that Obama would be a fool to choose Hillary Clinton after she's
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.200]  joked a couple times that he may be shot and killed or assassinated when the
[26:27.200 --> 26:32.960]  last assassination of that nature prior to the elections was Robert Kennedy
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.040]  back in the day, and it's been quite a long time since that yet she brings it
[26:38.040 --> 26:43.920]  up as if it is a probability. Very scary stuff. Now, he may be forced into it much
[26:43.920 --> 26:49.160]  like Reagan was forced to take George H. W. Bush. Reagan and George H. W. Bush had
[26:49.160 --> 26:56.400]  some heated words during the debates in 1980 prior to his election to the
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.280]  presidency, and he was forced to take George H. W. Bush as his vice
[27:01.280 --> 27:04.080]  presidential candidate. It was not something he was looking forward to. In
[27:04.080 --> 27:08.200]  fact, I don't think it's something he wanted. Remember, George H. W. Bush comes
[27:08.200 --> 27:13.280]  up as the head of the CIA out of nowhere supposedly, although he was a clandestine
[27:13.280 --> 27:17.720]  officer from all accounts prior to that, or you wouldn't just be the head of the
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.160]  CIA, folks. They don't just throw anybody in there. They throw people who have in
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.160]  long history of intelligence and keeping secrets and being manipulative in there.
[27:25.160 --> 27:29.960]  Then he becomes vice president for eight years, and let's not forget that Reagan
[27:29.960 --> 27:34.480]  is actually shot on the day of a presidential succession drill. We talked
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.680]  to Michael Rivera a little bit about that yesterday, and then Bush becomes
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.760]  president for four more years, and the follow-up to him is Billy Boyd Clinton,
[27:44.760 --> 27:47.840]  or as I like to call him, Bilderberg, Bill Clinton. Now that he's actually
[27:47.840 --> 27:50.680]  admitted to attending Bilderberg, we played that clip on the air yesterday,
[27:50.680 --> 27:57.080]  and Bilderberg, Bill Clinton was one of his drug runners in the 80s. Okay, let's
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.520]  let's be clear. Our government runs a lot of the drugs in this country. In fact,
[28:01.520 --> 28:04.840]  the majority of the cocaine, the majority of the heroin, they have a pretty
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.160]  good hold on the marijuana trade. The people that you see going to jail are
[28:09.160 --> 28:14.440]  those that aren't paying their cut, that aren't playing by the rules, and Billy
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.400]  Boyd Clinton was more than happy to run drugs through Mina Arkansas, and he is a
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.480]  great speaker. I mean, Bill Clinton, man, he is a snake charmer, isn't he? When I
[28:24.480 --> 28:27.800]  saw that, when he actually admits to Bilderberg, he's just getting hooded and
[28:27.800 --> 28:32.800]  hollering, and everybody's cheering. He's like a god of Olympus. He can do no wrong.
[28:32.800 --> 28:36.640]  People don't even know what he's saying. He's just putting a positive spin out.
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.200]  The economy was better when I was president. We enforced trade laws when I
[28:40.200 --> 28:44.280]  was president. I love America. We're not going to throw their interests away. Oh
[28:44.280 --> 28:47.560]  yeah, I went to Bilderberg. I know, yeah, they set policy there, but I wasn't there
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.280]  to set any North American policy. I was just there to sit in on some meetings
[28:51.280 --> 28:57.080]  with some Europeans about what was going to happen to Russia. Total bull, total
[28:57.080 --> 29:02.960]  nonsense. All right, let's get into some positive news.
[29:02.960 --> 29:08.120]  There's not a lot of that these days, but I just want to let people know that
[29:08.120 --> 29:14.280]  the courts have ruled, Missouri lawmakers have ruled, that they're going to make
[29:14.280 --> 29:20.520]  it a crime if people are ordered to be microchipped in their arms from private
[29:20.520 --> 29:25.840]  businesses. Well, good. There's no way my job should say, well, you want to keep
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.600]  your job? Here's a little chip. It's almost like that biometrics thing for

[33:41.640 --> 33:48.360]  All right, we are back. Missouri workers can't be forced to get microchip
[33:48.360 --> 33:52.240]  implants. That's some good news, actually, folks. They can't force you in a couple
[33:52.240 --> 33:56.080]  states to get microchip implants. I'm glad they're making these laws. It's been
[33:56.080 --> 34:01.000]  found of, you know, foreign cancer and rats and other animals, and there's no
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.960]  reason it needs to be in a human being. Although, one of the debunkers over at
[34:05.960 --> 34:13.400]  the JRF forums, Unsecured Coins. Very funny. Unsecured Coins. A few weeks back,
[34:13.400 --> 34:17.520]  it goes in for a checkup. He wasn't scheduled for one for about five years.
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.560]  This guy's military. He goes in, he passes with flying colors, and then they
[34:21.560 --> 34:25.480]  stamp this thing with RFID. They say, come back next week, next Thursday. We're
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.760]  going to chip you, and there's nothing he can do about it. There's this big
[34:29.760 --> 34:32.280]  thread, and people are like, well, why don't you just refuse it? He's like, well,
[34:32.280 --> 34:35.600]  then my career goes down the tubes, and we can't have our careers go down the
[34:35.600 --> 34:38.960]  tubes because then you can't pay your mortgage or your car payment, and you
[34:38.960 --> 34:42.080]  can't send your kid to college, or if they're a toddler, you can't put them into
[34:42.080 --> 34:46.240]  little league because you don't have the money. Okay, that's how they get you. They
[34:46.240 --> 34:50.360]  put you into a system first. They get you comfortable on that system. They get
[34:50.360 --> 34:54.640]  you to dedicate your life to that system, and then they put more
[34:54.640 --> 34:59.720]  restrictions on you. So let's go ahead and read this article. Your bosses can
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.960]  still make you work weekends and give you projects you loathe, but Missouri
[35:03.960 --> 35:08.560]  lawmakers have voted to make it a crime if they order a microchip to
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.520]  be implanted in your arm. Duh! It's common sense. Of course, there should be a law.
[35:13.520 --> 35:17.320]  They can't force you to put a microchip in your arm. What do you want? Forcing
[35:17.320 --> 35:21.520]  someone to get microchipped implanted is barred in California, North Dakota, and
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.340]  Wisconsin. Legislating awaiting governor Matt Blunt's signature would
[35:26.340 --> 35:30.100]  make it a misdemeanor with a fine of up to a thousand dollars for a boss who
[35:30.100 --> 35:34.840]  demands that a worker get an implant. A thousand? Let's make it ten thousand, huh?
[35:34.840 --> 35:38.040]  Let's make it really hurt. Let's make it a hundred grand. Let's hurt their pocket
[35:38.040 --> 35:42.240]  book. A thousand. They might even be, most of their employees probably make a
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.240]  thousand dollars a week. Come on. A thousand dollars. That's nothing. That's kind of
[35:47.240 --> 35:52.920]  makes me sick. Catherine Albright, an expert in consumer privacy and radio
[35:52.920 --> 35:57.480]  frequency identification. That's RFID folks. Acknowledges that microchip
[35:57.480 --> 36:02.560]  implants might sound like a black helicopter and tin foil hats. Ignore. No,
[36:02.560 --> 36:10.000]  it doesn't. Listen, a family went on television in 2001. They went on The
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.640]  Today Show and got chipped. The crazed mom got on there and said, Oh, it's gonna
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.120]  help us protect from terror. The government loves us. I want to do what I
[36:22.120 --> 36:25.880]  can. And she said it was her little kid's idea. I think the kid was like 11 or
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.120]  12 at the time. Some kind of techie. Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's listen to my
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.640]  11 or 12 year old kid about getting chipped. He knows. He's into technology and
[36:34.640 --> 36:37.400]  then it comes out. They were actually on a payroll.
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.480]  Verichip was paying them an ungodly amount of money to promote this and act
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.720]  like it was just the best thing since breakfast. Well, it's not. And you can go
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.680]  on eBay right now and for about $10 to $15, you can get one of these microchips
[36:51.680 --> 36:55.360]  that you can chip your dog with. But you know, it's a microchip. It's like a
[36:55.360 --> 36:57.840]  hypodermic needle. You can put it in anything you can put it in you. If you'd
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.000]  like, you could put it in your shoe. And then you subscribe to the service and
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.240]  you're part of a GPS tracking program. It's really nice. It's good stuff. But
[37:09.240 --> 37:13.920]  the founder of antichips.com and other critics argue they are tangible
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.280]  medical privacy and religious worries driving attempts to pass laws banning
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.840]  forced implants. Yeah. The people who oppose it don't understand how real the
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.240]  threat is. And the people who are gung ho don't understand its power, Albright
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.240]  said. Albright's been trying to persuade state lawmakers across the country to
[37:31.240 --> 37:36.040]  pass legislation regulating technology that allows for tagged items to be
[37:36.040 --> 37:40.440]  tracked when microchips send off a radio signal to special readers. The
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.640]  information can be linked to a database and if they're so easy to hack. Listen,
[37:44.640 --> 37:47.960]  it's an electronic device. Electronic devices can be hacked. They can be
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.760]  manipulated. They can do so rather easily. So when they say that you're gonna be
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.880]  safe and secure and no one can take your microchip, it's a load of bull. Yeah, they
[37:55.880 --> 37:58.920]  can't physically take it out of you. That doesn't mean they can't put new
[37:58.920 --> 38:03.040]  information on it, take old information off, hack into it, clone those chips. I
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.160]  mean, there's a ton of stuff they can do with it. It's a computer. Come on. This
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.800]  year, at least 17 states have considered bills regulating or restricting radio
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.640]  frequency identification or RFID according to the National Conference of
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.960]  State Legislators. Last year, there were 13. So that's positive that we're, you
[38:21.960 --> 38:27.200]  know, upping it. Well, I wish we had a law like that in New York. God. Radio
[38:27.200 --> 38:32.160]  tracking has been used for forcing, for tracing stores inventories in toll booths,
[38:32.160 --> 38:36.720]  quick passes, linking unconscious patients to important medical information, and
[38:36.720 --> 38:42.440]  even for uniting missing pets with their owners. Oh, so many positive things. But
[38:42.440 --> 38:46.080]  critics say the benefits pale in comparison to risks of cancer and
[38:46.080 --> 38:50.000]  identity theft by secretly lifting information off someone's microchip.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.560]  The nation's only federally approved maker of human microchips in plants has
[38:54.560 --> 38:58.680]  denied claims that its product can cause cancer. A spokesman for Florida-based
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.360]  Verichip Corp. did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Of course, they
[39:02.360 --> 39:07.240]  didn't because they've done the test. Yes, it causes cancer in mice. Just type in
[39:07.240 --> 39:14.720]  verichip cancer. Please, please. Look, this thing passed in 2004 from the FDA for
[39:14.720 --> 39:18.800]  human consumption. Okay. All right. We got Alex on the line. Hopefully on the
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.360]  landline. Alex, you're with us. Yes, Jason. It is incredible. Everybody's cell
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.160]  phones. We've got five of them. We'll have full bars and then no bars. There's
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.760]  definitely surveillance teams, white vans, black vans. Security follows us
[39:32.760 --> 39:36.560]  everywhere. I've never seen this much security and it doesn't even officially
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.560]  start till noon tomorrow. We're kicked out of the Westfields Marriott in the
[39:40.560 --> 39:47.240]  morning and we're staying at the Hilton just a few miles away with
[39:47.240 --> 39:51.560]  continual coverage, not just here, but on coast to coast AM. I was on last time
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.640]  giving him reports tonight and the next night so people can also tune in for
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.840]  that. They'll get several reports during the day here over the next three days
[39:59.840 --> 40:03.680]  and also just special reports during the weekend shows on Genesis and then we're
[40:03.680 --> 40:08.440]  going to obviously have a report on the Sunday show as well. Let me tell you the
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.440]  basics here. I have Jim Tucker sitting right next to me. We're gonna go to him
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.880]  in just a moment. Here's the bottom line. They normally only meet North America
[40:15.880 --> 40:19.680]  every five years, but two years ago they met in Ottawa, Canada and we went
[40:19.680 --> 40:22.720]  and attended that. Of course, I was detained and the rest of people know
[40:22.720 --> 40:26.080]  that story. It's covered in the end game. The reason it's so important is
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.240]  everything Jim in 30 plus years of reported on Bilderberg has ended up
[40:30.240 --> 40:33.200]  happening. That shows their power and control. He said Bush is going to
[40:33.200 --> 40:36.960]  endorse greenhouse gases and the global tax. He did it weeks later when Bush
[40:36.960 --> 40:40.000]  had said he'd never do it and people didn't believe it. He was proven right
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.640]  two weeks later. He said that they weren't going to attack in the latter
[40:44.640 --> 40:49.640]  part of 2002. The Bilderberg had met in this very hotel here in
[40:49.640 --> 40:54.240]  Chantilly at the Westfields Marriott. They've come back to the scene of the
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.880]  crime. They told Rumsfeld who attended. They said you are allowed to attack, but
[40:59.880 --> 41:04.960]  you have to attack next March. Jim said that nine months before the attack and
[41:04.960 --> 41:08.880]  it happened just as he said it would. We were at the scene of the Iraq
[41:08.880 --> 41:14.520]  planning. This is a place of high treason. This is the place here in
[41:14.520 --> 41:18.360]  Virginia right outside D.C. just a few miles in Chantilly where they
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.640]  orchestrated this in 2002. Now the Washington Post and others who attended
[41:22.640 --> 41:26.240]  lied to the public and said oh no it's going to be in the next few months in
[41:26.240 --> 41:31.400]  2002 knowingly premeditatedly and again Jim Tucker was right about that. He's got
[41:31.400 --> 41:34.960]  sources inside. We'll get the list in the next few days. We'll learn more and
[41:34.960 --> 41:40.640]  more, but I tell you we are in the belly of the beast here. We are right in the
[41:40.640 --> 41:47.000]  heart of the monster and I want to turn you over to Jim Tucker. Jim Jason
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.280]  Bermas is sitting in for me while we're here in Virginia. Just for a few minutes
[41:51.280 --> 41:57.440]  give people a basic rundown of what you've seen so far and then any questions
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.440]  that Jason has them. He'll come back to me in about five minutes. Ladies and
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.280]  gentlemen, Jim Tucker, the guy who's been hounding Bilderberg for 35 plus years.
[42:05.280 --> 42:08.720]  They tried to throw us off and say it was in Greece. That this info was exposed.
[42:08.720 --> 42:12.880]  Here we are now covering it yet again from the belly of the beast. Jim Tucker,
[42:12.880 --> 42:20.160]  American Free Press.net. Well hello. Hi Jim, how you doing man? Good. We're in the
[42:20.160 --> 42:26.360]  process now of developing sources. We will develop sources and we will expose
[42:26.360 --> 42:32.640]  these criminals as we do every year. Excellent. So Alex was telling me that
[42:32.640 --> 42:38.160]  it's unprecedented security over there. What's your take? Well I'm quite used to
[42:38.160 --> 42:45.400]  this kind of security. We're of course under constant surveillance. In other
[42:45.400 --> 42:51.720]  years I would recognize the guard who's assigned to be reading a newspaper
[42:51.720 --> 42:57.160]  at the breakfast table next to mine. If I'm in the gift shop buying newspaper
[42:57.160 --> 43:02.920]  he's in the gift shop looking around and then one morning just for the fun of it
[43:02.920 --> 43:08.600]  I opened my door suddenly and quickly and he's outside the door waiting. So I
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.640]  started calling him Charlie. I named it Charlie. I say okay Charlie it's time now
[43:13.640 --> 43:18.360]  first go down to the cocktail lounge. Come on Charlie. I'm going back to my room
[43:18.360 --> 43:26.480]  now. So I've gotten used to the kind of cute. Jim, I racked work planning. Listen I
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.120]  want to ask Jim right now this is important for everybody about 2002
[43:30.120 --> 43:34.360]  how they deceived us. Are they planning the attack on Iran or are they nixing the
[43:34.360 --> 43:37.520]  plan to attack Iran? Everybody knows the carriers are waiting it's all coming
[43:37.520 --> 43:42.360]  together. Jim can you answer that question? Well President Bush definitely
[43:42.360 --> 43:48.960]  wants to attack Iran as if our troops are not spread thin enough. The European
[43:48.960 --> 43:54.120]  Bilderbergs opposed the invasion of Afghanistan. You know the UN went along
[43:54.120 --> 44:01.000]  with that when they strongly opposed the invasion of Iraq. So as the night 2002
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.200]  as Alex said that the all the newspapers including the Bilderberg control
[44:05.200 --> 44:11.920]  newspapers were saying the war is coming this summer of 2002 our early fall at
[44:11.920 --> 44:18.240]  the latest and when Rumsfeld as then Secretary of Defense went out to the
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.840]  Bilderberg meeting and assured the Bilderberg kids there would be no
[44:21.840 --> 44:30.360]  invasion this year. Nevertheless their pledge of secrecy was so treasured that
[44:30.360 --> 44:34.360]  they allowed their own newspapers to be wrong. Now Jimmy Lee Ho Gluth who heard
[44:34.360 --> 44:40.000]  Rumsfeld's speech of the Washington Association for the Washington Post. He
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.040]  could have gone to the Post Newsroom and simply say boys stop predicting war this
[44:45.040 --> 44:49.480]  year. Don't ask me how I know I just know I'm the
[44:49.480 --> 44:52.360]  Washington Association editor. It's quick predicting war this year will not happen
[44:52.360 --> 44:59.960]  until 2003 and yet he will maintain this piece and let his own newspaper be wrong
[44:59.960 --> 45:07.760]  for the rest of the year. That's just a demonstration of their fierce loyalty to
[45:07.760 --> 45:12.280]  their pledge of secrecy. So this year do you think they're going to be discussing
[45:12.280 --> 45:15.280]  Iran? Do you think it's going to be on the table prior to the administration
[45:15.280 --> 45:20.160]  changing hands to either John McCain or Obama now being the nominee? Do you
[45:20.160 --> 45:23.840]  feel like they're going to be the planning of Iran at this meeting or are
[45:23.840 --> 45:29.920]  they going to push it back like they did in 2002? Well I think Bush wants to
[45:29.920 --> 45:35.040]  invade on his watch. It's so evident with all the propaganda coming out of the
[45:35.040 --> 45:41.400]  White House. All these months and months there's conditions of public
[45:41.400 --> 45:46.160]  mind for an invasion of Iran but there'll be heavy pressure from the Europeans
[45:46.160 --> 45:51.080]  not to do it. Do you think that pressure is going to hold water or do you feel
[45:51.080 --> 45:55.920]  like these guys are going to go ahead anyway? I mean we've had very
[45:55.920 --> 45:59.680]  little change in the administration. Donald Romsfeld being the one guy that
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.640]  really stepped down. Well I'm hopeful that the president will be pressured out of it.
[46:05.640 --> 46:11.160]  Otherwise he could find himself leaving the next president with a bloody war on
[46:11.160 --> 46:17.880]  his hands and maybe a hasty retreat as in Vietnam. And that would be
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.440]  actually pretty tough if we do put somebody like Obama into office who has
[46:22.440 --> 46:28.760]  pledged to end the war in Iraq and not start any more wars but I feel like in
[46:28.760 --> 46:32.560]  order to give that some sort of legitimacy in a different administration
[46:32.560 --> 46:38.480]  they would have to carry out some kind of a false flag attack. Yes that's easily
[46:38.480 --> 46:45.280]  done. We've seen it before in 1964. Lyndon Johnson is campaigning as the peace
[46:45.280 --> 46:51.480]  president and there you go. Water is being defined as the mad bomber. At that
[46:51.480 --> 46:59.360]  time in August of 64 President Johnson during the heated campaign simply
[46:59.360 --> 47:04.400]  pledged to the American people gain and gain and gain even though Franklin
[47:04.400 --> 47:12.080]  Roosevelt there would be no war. American boys will not be fighting a war as an
[47:12.080 --> 47:16.440]  Asian boys on a fight for themselves he said. Then he invented the Galvatongan
[47:16.440 --> 47:24.120]  fiction and every survivor well every sailor who served on the ship in
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.240]  question on discharge said their ship was never attacked. Pure fiction about an
[47:29.240 --> 47:37.360]  attack on Galvatongan incident which he used to rationalize going to war. And we've
[47:37.360 --> 47:42.240]  already seen like similar provocations in this Iran situation. The most
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.560]  prominent one I would say was a few months back when they had that speed
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.080]  boat that they said was Iranian and threatening a US ship and then that
[47:52.080 --> 48:00.720]  turned out to be all propaganda Jim. Yes it's not hard to invent an incident. So you
[48:00.720 --> 48:03.440]  feel like they'll do it. Do you feel like they have a better
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.240]  shot of doing this overseas something like a Galvatongan or something more
[48:07.240 --> 48:11.760]  homegrown like maybe a smaller scale or maybe even a larger scale 9-11 type
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.960]  attack. I certainly hope they don't resort to something so horrible. I think it's
[48:16.960 --> 48:22.880]  more likely that they'll come up with some provoked some incident perhaps in
[48:22.880 --> 48:28.000]  the middle of training where the ship is allegedly attacked. They have to fire
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.840]  back and kill everybody on the other ship and sink it in order to not have
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.640]  any dissent. Well I feel like they're gonna have to have some kind of a body
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.280]  count though to get the American people behind this. Maybe you know a destroyer
[48:43.280 --> 48:48.480]  going down some of our boys 15 or 20 soldiers killed by Iranians. Some sort of
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.640]  provocation where American lives are lost. Yes Bremenus of Pearl Harbor which
[48:53.640 --> 48:59.880]  Roosevelt provoked and knew about well in advance and those who apologize
[48:59.880 --> 49:03.840]  Roosevelt now real history is no longer a question. In fact he had advanced
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.000]  knowledge and had provoked the Japanese into the Pearl Harbor attack. They
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.920]  simply say he had to do that because the draft that passed by only one boat. We
[49:12.920 --> 49:15.920]  have to go to war in Europe or there will dictate peace terms from the
[49:15.920 --> 49:22.160]  White House and that kind of jazz. Well even if you accept is that argument
[49:22.160 --> 49:26.840]  which I don't. Why do you have to have 2,800 boys killed? Why not? Because the
[49:26.840 --> 49:31.000]  United States Commander-in-Chief ordered the ships dispersed off battle field
[49:31.000 --> 49:38.080]  row and into the scattered into the ocean. Why not order maneuvers that Sunday
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.560]  morning and have the airplanes in the skies lined up on the ground as easy
[49:42.560 --> 49:47.840]  targets and if you only killed 800 American boys the nation would be
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.320]  so outraged to be made to go to war. You don't have to kill 2,000 more. Well we
[49:52.320 --> 49:56.560]  already know that you know we've tried to provocate even Iraq prior to that war
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.720]  into shooting down planes that were painted up with UN colors and we
[50:01.720 --> 50:06.760]  couldn't get them to do that. We were unable to get Iran to attack our boats
[50:06.760 --> 50:12.440]  after we put out that propaganda. I just hope that if this does happen enough
[50:12.440 --> 50:15.280]  people in the American public are going to question it and aren't going to be
[50:15.280 --> 50:20.440]  rabid for another war which seems on the agenda and of course
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.760]  Bilderberg is meeting in DC like we discussed yesterday. It gives them very
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.720]  easy access to top generals, top lieutenants, top military guys, top
[50:29.720 --> 50:33.920]  insiders in Washington. This is the Alex Jones show. We will be back after this
[50:33.920 --> 50:53.440]  with Alex Jones and Jim Tucker, Infowars.com.
[50:53.440 --> 51:02.640]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.560]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group. But their objective
[51:07.560 --> 51:13.240]  being world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they
[51:13.240 --> 51:18.520]  hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[51:18.520 --> 51:25.880]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for
[51:25.880 --> 51:30.240]  world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the
[51:30.240 --> 51:34.320]  entire New World Order agenda. Bilderberg is making great progress for the world
[51:34.320 --> 51:37.200]  government. Most people have no idea they're not after money. They have all
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.320]  the money they need. They're after power. That's their after-easy. Order in-game on

[52:13.680 --> 52:20.080]  Life was hard for the 150 survivors of the sunken ship Pope drifting days in a
[52:20.080 --> 52:25.720]  lifeboat after the battle of the Java Sea in 1942, but it got much harder when
[52:25.720 --> 52:30.560]  captured and placed in the Japanese prison camp, Macassar, with 2,500 other
[52:30.560 --> 52:35.680]  prisoners of war. There they found themselves in the hands of cruel and
[52:35.680 --> 52:41.400]  barbarous captors, kicked and beaten unmercifully at the slightest provocation.
[52:41.400 --> 52:46.960]  And so it was one day for one helpless prisoner who was being beaten and clubbed
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.800]  to death. Blows from a heavy hauser were raining down on the helpless victim.
[52:51.800 --> 52:57.400]  American officer Lieutenant Richard Knott Atrium tried to stop it but was
[52:57.400 --> 53:03.640]  ignored. What could he do to save the life of one of his men? Then it came to
[53:03.640 --> 53:10.160]  him and he did it. What he did stopped the beating, stopped it cold and so
[53:10.160 --> 53:14.640]  astonished the torturous beaters they not only stopped but backed off in
[53:14.640 --> 53:19.320]  amazement. What he did that day not only saved a life but won him the
[53:19.320 --> 53:25.000]  Congressional Medal of Honor after the war. What did he do? Wealth? For the rest
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.520]  of that, another untold story, go to anotheruntoldstory.com. It's posted there

[53:51.840 --> 54:20.840]  In Constance Iroh, in his name, I am the man of Constance Iroh.
[54:20.840 --> 54:37.720]  I've seen trouble all my days. I've been fairway held to old Kentucky and we're gonna have a Kentucky we are
[54:37.720 --> 54:43.400]  change on a little while. Right now we have Jim Tucker and Alex Jones live from
[54:43.400 --> 54:46.600]  Bilderberg on the Alex Jones show. I just want to remind people before we go
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.000]  back to them that the Info Wars money bomb is still going on. We raised over
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.960]  $200,000 this week and we're gonna give out the grand total on Friday. If you
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.040]  want to support us you want to help us with this new TV network to get the
[54:58.040 --> 55:02.320]  info war to the masses because let me tell you the mainstream media is not
[55:02.320 --> 55:05.920]  covering the Bilderberg conference. The two gentlemen we're talking to are
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.040]  covering the Bilderberg conference and the majority of the information that
[55:09.040 --> 55:14.040]  comes out of there are going to come from Jim Tucker and Alex Jones. So let's
[55:14.040 --> 55:17.920]  get right back to them. What's your overview of the situation over in
[55:17.920 --> 55:23.160]  Chantilly, Virginia right now? Okay this is Alex Jones back live. I want to be
[55:23.160 --> 55:29.280]  clear here. History was made in the very building that I am standing in right now.
[55:29.280 --> 55:34.760]  History was made here in 2002. The green light was given for a completely
[55:34.760 --> 55:41.240]  illegal aggressive attack where our country was brought into Iraq to suppress
[55:41.240 --> 55:45.000]  the amount of oil that was flowing out to have a black hole to put now over
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.600]  $3 trillion into. $3 trillion black hole. Meanwhile more than four
[55:50.600 --> 55:54.360]  trillions disappeared out of the pension funds via the Pentagon, the Defense
[55:54.360 --> 55:58.480]  Department. And so I just wanted to hand the phone back to Jim Tucker and say Jim
[55:58.480 --> 56:01.800]  for the World Wide Radio audience listening right now. Specifically you've
[56:01.800 --> 56:07.520]  set on record they planned the 2003 attack of Iraq. We're now five plus years
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.960]  into that. Gave the green light for that here where we're standing in this very
[56:11.960 --> 56:17.160]  conference center in this very luxury hotel. What I'm asking you is, A, do you
[56:17.160 --> 56:22.520]  think they're going to attack Iran? B, will they be deciding during this key
[56:22.520 --> 56:26.400]  meeting in Virginia? Is that why they're coming back to North America so early?
[56:26.400 --> 56:32.360]  How important, how historical is this meeting right now, Jim Tucker? Well yes
[56:32.360 --> 56:39.040]  it is. Historical meeting, as Alex pointed out, it was when they last
[56:39.040 --> 56:46.120]  met here, the first meeting after the 9-11 terrorist attacks. The United
[56:46.120 --> 56:50.640]  States and most of the American participating in
[56:50.640 --> 56:56.560]  Bilderberg were all far from going to war. The Europeans opposed it. Now President
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.080]  Bush wants to attack Iran very badly. All the signs are there. All the
[57:02.080 --> 57:07.760]  political propaganda about what a threat they are are there. I'm hoping that
[57:07.760 --> 57:13.240]  the Europeans, it's unusual for Bilderberg to be split on a major subject. First
[57:13.240 --> 57:17.560]  time I've ever known them to be split on a major subject such as war. They were all
[57:17.560 --> 57:24.960]  far. The invasion of Yugoslavia under the Clinton administration. They
[57:24.960 --> 57:30.240]  celebrated America getting over at Smith Dam syndrome they called it. I'm hoping
[57:30.240 --> 57:37.040]  that the Europeans can pressure the United States out of attacking Iran but
[57:37.040 --> 57:41.600]  I'm afraid that it might be difficult because the President is so determined
[57:41.600 --> 57:47.080]  to go to war in Iran no matter how much blood he leaves or stands for the next
[57:47.080 --> 57:53.680]  President to deal with. Jim, Jim, hold on Jason. Jim can you specifically speak
[57:53.680 --> 57:58.080]  about do you believe that the decision to go to war or not to go to war is going
[57:58.080 --> 58:07.040]  to be made this weekend? I really don't know. The Americans
[58:07.040 --> 58:11.520]  are going to try to make the case for war this weekend and I'm just hoping the
[58:11.520 --> 58:17.320]  Europeans will resist it strongly enough to avoid it but I'm afraid that the
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.720] ... Alright we'll be back with Jim Tucker and Alex Jones right after this. It is the
[58:21.720 --> 58:33.440]  Alex Jones show. They're at Bilderberg folks.

[59:41.200 --> 59:51.640]  Join the info war today. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[59:51.640 --> 59:54.200]  network.
[59:57.080 --> 1:00:05.160]  Media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on
[1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:13.560]  the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas. Alex Jones. Alright folks
[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:18.640]  we are back yet again I am Jason Burmos with me Alex Jones and Jim Tucker. They
[1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:22.840]  are reshaping Eurasia. The establishment has taken over Afghanistan. They have
[1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:27.920]  taken over Iraq. You know they want Iran. Are they going to decide whether or not
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:33.240]  to invade Iran this year at this Bilderberg conference. Let's get it
[1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:37.160]  straight from the sources that are there. Alex, Jim, what do you think? Is this
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:39.680]  going to be it? Are they going to decide to go into Iran? Is it going to be more
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:43.360]  about the presidency? What are they going to be discussing? Well just for the
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:46.440]  listeners all over the world the new stations that just tuned in. We are in
[1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:52.280]  Chantilly, Virginia, a bedroom community of Washington DC at the Westfields
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:57.360]  Marriott 2008. They're back at the scene of the crime where they gave the
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:02.800]  green light for the attack on Iran in 2002 and launched the attack in
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:08.200]  2003. Our cell phones when they're turned off turn on by themselves will have
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:12.720]  full bars. They won't let us take phone calls. There's definitely electronic
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.120]  warfare going on here. We know that's happened in the past. Jim at other events
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:21.600]  has found bugs in his room. We are being followed by security. They're not even
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:25.240]  hiding it everywhere we go. When we get out our cell phones they run up and make
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:29.440]  sure we're not using those to videotape. It is just absolutely amazing but as
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:34.000]  American citizens, as free humans, we have a right to be here to be covering
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:40.360]  what leaders from all over the world and the owners of the Fortune 100 and
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:44.200]  royalty, the Rockefellers, the Rothschild representatives are doing. We have a
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:48.760]  right and Jim always makes the point. We had 125 movie stars meeting in secret.
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.960]  There'd be 50 helicopters and people freaking out wanting to know what was
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:55.360]  happening. But remember just seven or eight years ago the media still
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:59.600]  denied this even existed. Now the Washington Post was even forced to admit
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:05.120]  that the headline was they rule. And said yes we rule the planet, we run
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:09.080]  your lives and that's the key here. This is historical, this is important. That's
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:12.560]  why Genesis Network is so important. That's why infowars.com, everybody,
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:16.560]  support is so important. Why thank them? Because this is so important. What we do,
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:20.360]  we risk our lives, our time, our energy, we're passionate, we're dedicated and we
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:24.800]  owe so much to Jim Tucker for pioneering and exposing the true tip top of the
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:27.520]  pyramid. You know, in the superclass article they wrote for the New York Times
[1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:31.200]  admitting they run the world want world government, Rothkopf says it's 6,000.
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:36.080]  Those are the Gophers, the Minions, the highest level of servants. This is the
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:39.880]  owners of the planet. This is the Eugenicist. These are the people that
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:42.680]  are poisoning our water and our food. These are the people that are carrying
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:46.560]  out eugenics against us with the Marisol filled vaccines. We're only
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:51.920]  going to do two more minutes with Jim. Jim, again, any other key points you want to add?
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:03:01.920]  Well, I would add that the, whether or not the United States invades Iran this year
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:07.800]  might well be decided at this meeting. I'm hopeful that it will not happen, but I'm
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:14.760]  afraid it will because it's held bent to invade Iran and leave large-buddied
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:20.360]  footprints in the sands of time. They will also be discussing if not
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:29.800]  celebrating the price of oil. It was in, I think it was in 05 when, reaching from my
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:33.960]  memory here, but about two or three years ago they announced the price of oil,
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:38.720]  which was then $40 a barrel, was going to rise over the years to $140 a
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:46.520]  barrel. It's up to $133 a barrel. I don't know what they're going to do
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:49.440]  with the subject, but I know it's definitely on their agenda. Do you think
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.960]  we're going to hit $200 a barrel? Do you think that's on the agenda? Maybe to
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:56.800]  push it even further up so we're paying $6, $7 a gallon at the pump?
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:03.120]  I really don't know, but I will know when this meeting is over. I'll know.
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:06.720]  Excellent. Well, you got to keep us posted on that because it just seems like
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.360]  they keep bringing up the price of gas, and I've seen so many articles prepping
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:15.440]  us saying we still have it too good that they pay, you know, $6, $7 a
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.960]  liter in other countries, and we deserve to pay more. Jim is what they're trying to
[1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:25.960]  tell us. Yes, a long Bilderberg tradition of lowering America's standard of
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:30.680]  living to the same level as in European countries would be much better for them
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:34.480]  to live the standard of living in European countries of the level of the
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:38.520]  United States. But we all know that won't happen. They're trying to enslave us. Jim
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:45.760]  Tucker, Alex Jones at Bilderberg, 08 will be back after this. It is the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:55.200]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet

[1:07:54.880 --> 1:08:02.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:10.240]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network, and now, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:16.360]  Alex Jones. Well, the establishment is added again, folks. The eugenicists are
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:20.560]  meeting this weekend, and what will be on the agenda? Will it be the depopulation
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:23.880]  program that we all know about? Well, for sure they're going to be talking about
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:28.680]  reducing the standard of living of American citizens as they've done over
[1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:31.760]  the last, you know, five to ten years. They've really lowered the standard of
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:35.160]  living in this country. They've upped the prices. Inflation is out of control, and
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:39.680]  there seems to be more and more government control of our lives. Jim, you
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:44.720]  were just discussing how you were hoping that they would up the European standard
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:48.640]  of living to that of the United States, but in fact, it seems like the standard
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:52.280]  of living in the United States has gone down. There's literally food rationing
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:56.240]  going on in New York. It's something that's unheard of to me. Is this the
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.800]  program they're keeping up with? Are they going to lower our standard of living
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:03.800]  even more, Jim? Jason, I want you to reintroduce that great question in a
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:09.640]  moment as we close out this interview with Jim. I just wanted to, again, point
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:12.800]  out what Jim was just bringing up. How they're lowering our standard of living,
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:17.600]  how they're inflating, how they're destroying the currency,
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:22.760]  the inflation. Jim said three years ago this was on the agenda. Jim only makes
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:27.360]  four or five announcements a year from his sources, from his intel, from coming
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:30.480]  back and interviewing people after the globalists leave. You know, they'll never
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:33.360]  talk to us beforehand. They've all been told they'll be fired if they talk to us.
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:36.000]  We've talked to a bunch of people from people serving the coffee, you know,
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.040]  dumping Starbucks to people in the bar in the restaurant who work here to
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:44.560]  bell hops, and they're scared. But then after they see the evil and hear the
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:47.320]  evil and are treated like crap, they're told they're not allowed to look at
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:50.760]  Bilderberg group members in the eyes. After they're treated like crap by this
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:55.440]  125 global rulers who just want to dehumanize them and
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.400]  euthanize them and go out of the way, they always give us even more intel, but
[1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:01.880]  Jim actually has sources inside Bilderberg, not members, but some of their
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.360]  minions. But I just wanted to say we'll have reports at the end of the show
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:09.560]  again today. If anything big happens, I'll call in another Genesis shows and I
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:13.280]  will be live again on there with you tomorrow. You did a great job, Jason. I
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:17.600]  appreciate it. And of course Friday and then Saturday and coming back on Sunday.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:21.880]  But yes, bring that question back up to Jim Tucker because it's so amazing. And
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:27.280]  then after you bring up that question for him, ask Jim. All the predictions
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:30.920]  he's made are true. I mean, he said it's going to be $140 plus a barrel in the
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.000]  next two years and it happened. And so in a few days, we're going to learn the
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.800]  course of our lives. There's no other group where you can go spy on them. We're
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:44.280]  spying on the globalists. We're spying on the black hand. We're spying on the
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:48.160]  people that own the central banks. I mean, this is it. So bring up that
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:55.120]  population reduction point you were pointing out about raising their
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:58.960]  control over the world while lowering our standard of living and then bring up
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:01.920]  the fact that he's been right about the oil specifically. Here's Jim Tucker.
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:05.800]  All right, Jim Tucker joining us again and his predictions have all come true.
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:08.520]  It's not like he makes these wild predictions. He says about three or
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:12.400]  four things a year, just like Alex said, you know, from the price of gas to the
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:16.200]  invasions into other countries. And we were discussing standard of living, Jim,
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:19.320]  and you were saying, well, why don't they just bring up the European standard of
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:22.640]  living to the United States? But what we're seeing is the opposite. We're
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:27.040]  seeing the lowering of the standard of living in this country to that of Europe.
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:29.720]  Do you think that's going to be on the agenda? Do you think that's going to
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:38.400]  continue? That's been on the agenda for decades with the Billenberg kids. They
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:41.960]  won't, everybody has a lower standard of living. As Alex said, they're more
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:52.040]  controllable when they're poor donkeys. It's the wealth to entrepreneurs. Now
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:57.800]  we're seeing the effect of one seventh of the world's population is at risk of
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:12:05.200]  dying of diseases and hunger because of the cost of food being at a record
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:12.240]  half throughout the world because of the cost of fuel. And they're behind the
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:18.880]  ethanol thing, which cost even more. Well, we don't have ethanol pipelines like we
[1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:22.920]  have old pipelines. But the subsidiaries from ethanol, it seems like they're
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:26.920]  shutting down a lot of farms or a lot of farms that used to grow food for this
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:30.840]  ethanol production, which is further upping the prices of food.
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:38.200]  Correct, Jim? Absolutely, because economists tell us that something like 40% of
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:42.120]  on average, everything you buy, whether it's a house or a necktie or a loaf of bread,
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:47.120]  to be attributed to the cost of transportation is a long journey from
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:51.040]  raw material to finished product to marketplace. So when you drive up the
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:55.800]  price of food, we now have ancient people in the Social Security who have to
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:59.280]  give away their dogs because they need to eat the dog food at the end of the month.
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:03.920]  They're not taking their medications because they have to eat. It's a horrible
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:13.440]  situation for not just the very poor, but the not so poor when their food budget
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:21.480]  costs multiply as they have. And when you take one fourth of the corn crop and
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:28.760]  turn it into ethanol, and corn is the basis of so much of our finished food
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:33.440]  products, and that has a tremendous impact on the price of food, which has a
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:39.880]  tremendous impact on the standard of living, directly threatening millions with
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:47.800]  starvation. Also, as I said, causing poor people to be unable to afford their
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:54.320]  medications, to be unable to afford to eat property, if at all for the last three
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:59.560]  days of the month before their welfare check arrived, or social security check
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:02.640]  arrived. And they're just getting more and more people on that program because in
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:07.640]  the last year, they've blown out the US economy, they've blown out the housing
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:11.840]  market, they've upped the price of gas, they've stopped food production, and I
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:16.320]  think it is their plan to get more people on social services so that they
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:19.720]  are in the system, that they're used to getting a government paycheck, that they're
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:23.680]  used to bowing down to the government. And, you know, me and Alex were predicting
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:28.080]  if this thing goes just terrible, and the government start taking over some of
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:31.400]  these supermarkets, and it becomes a ration center, you can bet your bottom
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:34.640]  dollar they're going to give you a card, much like they're giving those who are on
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:39.520]  welfare and food stamps right now, in order to go get your rations, Jim. Yes,
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:46.160]  Bilderberg, euphemism, all of this is the population control. By that they
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:53.440]  mean killing the third baby as they did in China, well, that's known as abortion,
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:58.200]  I suppose. In fact, they're saying that the United States should pass a law
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:03.080]  permitting, even that got awful partial birth abortion, that is for the babies
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:07.840]  already coming out. They turn it around in the birth canal, take it out feet
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:12.880]  first, which are also dangerous with mother more so than coming out head first
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:16.880]  as usual. By the way, Jim, they're also calling for a one-child policy here in the
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:21.880]  U.S. about one-child policy. Bilderberg, let's introduce the question. Oh, yes,
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:29.440]  one-child policy is obviously aimed at reducing the population on earth, and
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:35.520]  of course with abortion and starvation and disease, they make great progress. In
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:41.680]  fact, some economists tell us that one billion people, one house, seven million
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:47.640]  people on this planet are likely to die. It's insane. You know, ABC has this
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:53.240]  website that they redirect kids to called PlanetSlayer.com, and in it young
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:56.880]  people, and why I say young people, I'm talking five to eight-year-olds, are led
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:16:01.060]  to believe that they've used up their quote-unquote carbon footprint by the
[1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:05.480]  time they're 14 months old, and it literally shows a cartoon of two pigs
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:11.000]  and in the middle blood from a dead human, saying that they need to die 14
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.120]  months after they're born, because they're taking up too much carbon, Jim.
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:20.720]  Is this getting us ready for a new form of taxation, the carbon tax?
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:28.160]  Well, Bilderberg never found a tax that didn't like. Carbon tax, tax be one of
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:36.320]  their favorite world tax, though it was taxing oil at the wellhead. So it'd be a
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:41.600]  direct tax for anybody who buys gasoline for their car, lawnmower, or for
[1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:44.400]  whatever purpose, be paying directly a tax for the United Nations.
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:49.040]  Well, one of the big proponents of this carbon idea, other than Al Gore, seems to
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.000]  be Gordon Brown, who's the Prime Minister over in the UK, and he has openly
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.040]  discussed a new world order prior to himself being elected, and then after he
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:01.200]  was elected, it was literally on the front page of mainstream press over there,
[1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:04.400]  and this guy is the guy promoting this carbon tax, Jim.
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:07.400]  Yes, and Tony Blair was a Bilderberg kid, too.
[1:17:07.400 --> 1:17:10.920]  Do you think Gordon Brown's going to possibly be at this Bilderberg meeting?
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:13.520]  Has he attended before? It is very likely, interesting.
[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:16.720]  I don't know, but it's very likely.
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:21.920]  So who do you think are going to be some of the staples? We see David Rockefeller
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:25.520]  there almost every year. Do you feel like he's going to show up?
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:29.080]  Yes, he's there every year. He's quite frail now, deep into his 90s.
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:35.080]  He was at the Trilateral Commission meeting a few weeks ago. Henry Kissinger, of course,
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:42.600]  is regular. In Peter Sutherland, the Executive Committee of both Bilderberg
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:48.320]  and Trilateral, he'll certainly be here. In fact, there's only typically about four
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:53.920]  or five new faces at a Bilderberg meeting each year, and if they're not invited back,
[1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:57.040]  that means they've been cast aside.
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:03.280]  Well, they don't always invite everybody every year. For instance, Edwards was taken
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:08.040]  in the year he was elected to be Vice President for the Democratic nomination.
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:10.960]  That's right, Jim. He's now bringing up that John Edwards was brought in.
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:14.600]  We've got it in this interview now. We're probably from on the street, be able to get
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:19.440]  Jim. He always does the ceremony, the ritual of trying to walk up and get in after they've
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:22.800]  already shut it down. We're going to try to be live on air around
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:27.360]  the noon time, central or so, whenever Jim wants to do that. We're going to be bringing
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:31.720]  him down here from his hotel after we have to check out of the scene of the crime of
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:36.040]  their crime. We'll be doing that tomorrow, but I want to thank Jim Tucker for being on
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:41.000]  the show. I'm going to hand it back over to you, Jason Burmes. Thank you so much for
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  doing the great job while we're out of town, and I want to thank all the other people that
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.200]  are tuned into the show today. Again, thank everybody for the money bomb. The more I think
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:51.080]  about it, it just totally blows me away, and I just love all of you out there. Thank
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:53.400]  you so much. Burmes, I'm turning it back over to you.
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:57.520]  Alright, Godspeed, Alex, and keep up the good work. Another way that we actually keep this

[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:55.560]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:05.400]  of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:09.440]  line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:14.360]  Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation, and higher taxes? These
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:18.320]  questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:22.760]  Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:27.840]  central bank power. A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking

[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:03.720]  the destroyers. The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:08.200]  of the population of the U.S. Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:12.920]  are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the man and bringing them to justice.
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:18.160]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over. They are called Illuminati.
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:23.720]  Elite, proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:28.240]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago. Everything they have built
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:32.920]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:37.920]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind. We will undo through the authority

[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:58.240]  in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:02.240]  waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and our high
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:06.840]  stress lifestyles. It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:11.840]  disease. The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:16.800]  ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:22.720]  Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years. Instantly transform

[1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:07.800]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back. I am Jason Bermas in for Alex Jones, Alex
[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:14.440]  and Jim just giving us a blockbuster material from the Bilderberg conference where they honestly
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:19.040]  decide what's going to happen to this country and the world over the next 12 months until
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:23.480]  they meet again. I mean obviously they have a two week retreat over in the Bohemian Grove
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:28.200]  but that's around 3,000 members and although they have a lot of things going on there,
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:35.360]  this is a more concentrated group of people, only a couple hundred and I can't tell you
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:41.840]  how important it is that we talk about Bilderberg. Go check out John Ronson's special where he
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:45.880]  did a little series, I think it's Adventures with Extremists, Alex has an episode, David
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:50.120]  Eich has an episode, but Jim Tucker's episode about the Bilderberg group, they literally
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:54.680]  get followed by secret service agents and when they pull over the secret service agents
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:59.760]  just pull over right next to them. They hang out because they are being surveilled and
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:04.960]  I just want to remind people that you can get a boost to energy without this garbage
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:09.960]  rock star energy drink or monster energy drink. I've seen so many energy drinks that are just
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:13.960]  sugar and caffeine and now they have these little spot on energy, none of that's good
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:20.200]  for you folks. So why don't you go to enterfood.com that's E N E R food dot com or you can call
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:28.920]  them at 866-762-9238 that's 866-762-9238. Alright let's go to my guest who's been patiently
[1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:34.120]  holding for the last 15-20 minutes. We have Adam Cunnington of Kentucky, we are changed
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:37.560]  one of the true info warriors out there. Adam how you doing?
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:42.520]  Pretty good, good afternoon Jason. Now how did you get involved in We Are Change? I mean
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:49.080]  this is an organization that has just exploded over the past almost two years now, it's been
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:53.360]  a little less than two years since Luke put it together. Chapters throughout the country,
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:56.400]  throughout the world really and why don't you tell us a little bit about how you got
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:03.600]  started and your chapter over in Kentucky? Well I didn't really see any type of real
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:09.880]  organization with anything going on here in the Louisville area. And from my studies
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:15.560]  within Madeline 11 Truth online I came across some of the very first We Are Change videos
[1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:21.560]  of New York and really appreciated what they were doing. You know taking the patriotic stance
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:31.120]  going at it, going at the people that are actually committing these crimes atrocities
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:36.960]  and confronting them face-to-face and I just respected that so much that I had to do something,
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:49.280]  I had to take organizational status here in my own area and that's pretty much how I
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.440]  started to prepare. So really you just saw other people coming out doing what's right
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:57.080]  and you said you know what I want to be a part of this, this is one of the few groups
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:01.640]  out there that truly is organic, that is talking about the real issues that are confronting
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:05.400]  the big boys and what did you do? Just email Luke and he kind of gave you a little bit
[1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:11.480]  of direction, I know that's who I send people to. Yeah I just emailed Luke, asked him if
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:17.600]  it would be alright if I created a chapter here out of the Louisville area and he pretty
[1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:25.440]  much said that would be fine. So I went from there, started organizing with what I found
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:32.080]  with a couple other people and they started also an Outlet and Truth global group. So
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:43.240]  now we've got fairly large, done such confrontations as Tom Brokaw, Lee Hamilton, Ted Nugent, Oliver
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:47.800]  North as of recent. Well that was you guys and Oliver North, I mean I recently saw that
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:50.720]  video, I didn't know that was you guys in Kentucky, why don't you tell people about
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:59.720]  that, they literally took your videos right? Yeah that was me and we are changing Kentucky
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:08.520]  doing a combined effort with we are changing Ohio and Cody Dee to come down and do the
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:16.840]  NRA event. He did address your questions but he always was spinning it, were you the guy
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:22.840]  that was standing up actually asking the questions? No that was Cody Dee from we are changing
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:28.200]  Ohio. Well when Cody's asking the questions, Oliver North, he's a pretty smart guy and
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:32.800]  he keeps phrasing it that this is going to be a constitutional government, a constitutional
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:36.440]  government. Now when he brings up the fact and he says well you're getting your information
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:42.280]  from the internet and he's like well no I saw the hearing of Iran Contra where Brooks
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:47.680]  asks you about it and the suspension of the constitution and he doesn't want to talk
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:51.440]  about that aspect of it, he never wants to talk about the suspension of the constitution,
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:56.000]  he doesn't want to talk about how continuity of government doesn't necessarily have a constitutionally
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:01.040]  elected leader and he doesn't want to discuss how those FEMA camps have been built all throughout
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:05.160]  the country for us, they're not for anybody else, you know we're not putting foreigners
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:11.400]  in there okay and they're there, all you have to do is type in FEMA camps and what really
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:16.440]  disturbs me most is that Aliburton got the private contracts to build these things and
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:20.200]  then they took their offices and moved them out to Dubai, why would they move them to
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:25.160]  Dubai? Well so we don't have access to them if they want to round us up. Adam Cunnington
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:28.080]  of We Are Changed Kentucky, we're going to talk to them on the other side, this is the

[1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:28.600]  Alright folks, we're back jamming on the
[1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:34.400]  Alex Jones show. I am Jason Bermas and if you want to get at me personally I'm at myspace.com
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:39.320]  slash Jason Bermas. Love a few more friends. I got a few thousand these days. I know Alex
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:44.720]  has something like 50,000 and I use it for networking. I actually do email people back.
[1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:49.960]  I read all the messages. If you want to get at me that is probably the easiest way to
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.880]  do so. We're talking to Adam Cuttington of Kentucky We Are Changed. They recently confronted
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:59.480]  Oliver North, lost their videotapes, got them back, threw it up on the internet. I'd be
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:04.360]  playing clips from that but of course we're having computer issues over at the command
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:10.160]  center in Austin, Texas. But one of the really other interesting things I thought Oliver
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:14.680]  North said was that he admitted that newspapers are going down the drain and young people
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:21.400]  just don't believe them anymore and they're going to alternative news sources and he didn't
[1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:27.960]  want to name those to give them recognition but I'm sure infowars.com, prismplanet.com,
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:32.560]  were some of the sites that he was referring to. What's your take on that Adam?
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:37.680]  I mean yeah, he pretty much hit the nail on the head there. Young people aren't trusting
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:46.880]  the very few media outlets they're trying to control the minds of the public out there.
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:51.360]  Yeah, people aren't buying into the corporate media especially the younger people, the people
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:55.480]  that are burning copies will lose change and handing them out to their friends and family.
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:00.040]  They're not going to CNN.com either. They might be going there linked from another place
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:04.360]  but they don't trust the corporate media anymore because they've been caught lying again and
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:09.640]  again and again. Yeah, it seems like they're scared. That's why he was talking about that.
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:16.280]  He's a reporter for Fox News. Yeah, absolutely. He has that special. It's an hour long show.
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:22.600]  I think it's about war heroes. He pumps his book all the time. This is a real insider.
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:28.720]  This is one of those guys that I feel he's in the room when the think tank is going through
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:33.600]  the separate plans. In other words, he's listening to the ideas and the plans and he's signing
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:39.280]  off on what he thinks and then he goes and he meets with his overlords back in the day
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:45.440]  that would have been people like George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, members of their cabinet
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:51.240]  and now his role is really that of a propagandist. Again, he's a pretty well-spoken guy. He can
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:56.840]  misdirect very well if people don't understand the subject matter. I mean, it's very easy
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:00.840]  for people to say, oh, it's on the internet. It's not true. Well, what's on the internet
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:06.280]  are stories based on mainstream media stories with links to the mainstream media sources.
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:11.200]  That's what he's not telling you. Instead, he just says, oh, you're reading the internet.
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:16.960]  Well, the internet is just as much a viable source of information, if not more, than television
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:22.560]  and newspapers and magazines like Time at this point because it is the only true source
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:27.960]  of open information left. You still with us, Adam?
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:34.680]  Yeah, yeah, I'm with you. Yeah, I agree. So how can people support you guys? I mean,
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:38.200]  you guys in particular, I mean, how many members do you have down in Kentucky? Do you need
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:41.600]  more members? I mean, obviously, we could always need more people. We always need more
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:44.440]  info orders. That's right. We always need more info orders.
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:49.480]  So how do they get into this? Well, what do you guys have a Kentucky We Are Change site?
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:55.560]  We have a kentuckyannachange.org is our website. We also have a MySpace, which is MySpace.com,
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:05.080]  such as Kentucky Annachange. You can contact us through either one of those outlets.
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.400]  So what's on the horizon? What do you guys think? Obviously, you're active. You're taking
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:13.280]  upon yourselves to become the citizen media. This is the new form. I mean, you're getting
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:19.680]  thousands of hits on your YouTube videos. Who's the next victim? Who's in the crosshairs?
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:27.520]  Well, I really don't want to put out there what our next ambitions are, as of right now.
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:32.280]  But I can say that we have, there's a little bit of interest throughout the group to cover
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:39.000]  the 2,300 Marines that will be landing in Indianapolis within the next week or two.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  I can't remember the date. I'm sorry. And what are they coming in for? Are they coming
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.360]  in for some kind of a massive exercise? Urban warfare drills. Oh, isn't that nice?
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.800]  They've been doing these since 99, but I'm sure they're going to say, well, now we're
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:53.800]  in a post-911 world. We actually have to be ready for this.
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:38:05.840]  Yeah. So we have a couple of people that may be going to cover that. And also, you can
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:10.120]  find information about that in the Indy Star website if anybody out there would like to
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:16.760]  find information about that and just go up themselves. Also, we have, I'm helping kick
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:23.160]  off a central Indiana We Are Change out of Indianapolis, which you can find out information
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:27.040]  about on the Kentucky and a Change meetup page as well.
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:31.160]  Excellent. Excellent. Well, man, I just got to tell you, keep up the great work. If they
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:35.720]  take your cameras, make a big stink about it, say, look, we have free speech in this country
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:40.360]  still. We still have a First Amendment. We're the new media. We're putting this out there
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:45.000]  for the masses. You don't have the right to take our stuff. You know, I mean, it's a big
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  win that you did get those tapes back. It's a big loss for the country that the police
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.720]  felt like they had the right to take that from you. But what do you expect in this
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:57.960]  Jackboot society? So, you know, I wish you the best of luck with this urban warfare drill.
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:01.320]  God knows what they're going to do in it, but I hope you get great footage, man.
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:05.600]  Thank you. You're doing great work out there, Jason. You keep it up.
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:09.680]  All right. Thanks. That's Adam from We Are Change, Kentucky. I'm not sure, but we might
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.960]  have Jonathan Elanoff on the line right now. All right. He's calling him right now. So,
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:21.160]  Jonathan Elanoff is of We Are Change, Colorado. And I personally know Jonathan. He brought
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:26.440]  Cory and Dylan and myself out there for a week out in February. We screened the movie
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:32.520]  to almost 2,000 people at three different screenings, two separate venues. Denver was
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:37.840]  just an awesome place. And that's where they're holding the DNC this year. That's where they
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:43.000]  have a provocateur group called Recreate68 where they're encouraging you to come down
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:48.080]  so you can throw red paint on people so you can wear a mask and you can destroy other
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:53.040]  people's cameras. Yeah, that sounds like a real group. That sounds like an anti-protest
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:57.360]  group that has some legitimacy. Let's attack others. Let's throw paint on others. Let's
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:01.000]  destroy the evidence of what actually happened. You know what that sounds like to me? That
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.680]  sounds like provocateurs. That sounds like the WTO in Seattle. That sounds like nonsense.
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:09.120]  And on the line is somebody who's going to be there for sure. I'm going to try to make
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:13.680]  it out there. I've got a wedding right after that, but it is very important that we go
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.760]  down to the DNC. We go down there peacefully and we actually film those who would not be
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:24.600]  peaceful. We film those that are on the payroll of the establishment. I mean, they got caught
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:29.400]  in Canada. They had one of these guys. You know, he had the jack boot on. He had the
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:33.800]  mask over his face. He was talking about throwing rocks at the police officers and the police
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:38.360]  come over to arrest him. Everybody already knows he's a cop. But when they bend him down,
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:42.800]  you see the bottom of his shoe. You see his whole shoe. And lo and behold, it's the same
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:46.680]  shoes that the police officers are wearing, Jonathan. Weird, huh?
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:52.000]  What's going on, man? Always a pleasure. Always a pleasure. Jonathan Elanoff of We Are
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.920]  Change Colorado and TruthAlliance.net. Why don't you just give people a heads up of
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:02.160]  how they can get involved if they're in your area and what you guys have been up to lately?
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:07.160]  Well, they can come up to any of our meetings and host them every Monday night. And they
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:15.160]  can find out about that if they go to WeAreChangeColorado.org. And our media, basically, our media
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:22.560]  network is TruthAlliance.net. And you can contact us through any of those sites. And
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:32.200]  you know, we do everything from confronting the global elite to discussing agendas to get
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:35.720]  the word out, to make sure we start recruiting more people to the truth movement and try
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:41.880]  to get some people out there and not wake them up. And it's just, there's something
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:47.000]  for everyone, I guess. But you know, it's funny because when I wrote those articles
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:54.400]  and blew the whistle, I've received everything from credit and praise from people in Colorado
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:00.920]  to some people questioning why I would even do such a thing. And it's been interesting
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:05.760]  coming across the many colors of the activists that are out here.
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:10.440]  Well, it blows people's minds when you actually shatter the false left-right paradigm when
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:16.440]  you say, hey man, I'm not a raging socialist leftist. And hey man, I'm not a raging, you
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:22.040]  know, conservative apologist for this administration. I'm what you like to call a constitutionalist.
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:27.040]  I believe in the Bill of Rights, in the Constitution, I believe in a constitutional government.
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:31.720]  I'm not here to abuse my rights. I'm not here to throw paint on people. I'm not here
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:37.000]  to bring a shield and incite riots. That's what they want you to do. Okay? It's very
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.240]  obvious to me that this is an op, that somebody at the top is putting this out there to try
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:48.160]  to cause violence at the DNC, to try to shift the focus on, you know, that we're out of
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:51.560]  control, that we don't even deserve a vote. I could see that, oh, we don't even deserve
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:54.360]  to vote anymore, Jonathan. We can't stop rioting.
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:43:00.360]  That's exactly right. And, you know, that's the whole point of peaceful revolutions and
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:07.360]  trying to get people to, to really just, you know, try to wake up to how to, how to create
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:12.840]  a revolution, what causes change. And if people really look at history, they'll notice that
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:20.320]  the only change comes from true leadership. Very few times through violence has change
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:25.880]  been brought. Now, this country was, was made through violent radical change, but that was
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:30.680]  a last resort. Now, we certainly are not at our last resort. Everyone knows that. We're
[1:43:30.680 --> 1:43:35.640]  far from that. There's many options, many opportunities. And when we gather in large
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:41.960]  numbers, it is so important to take advantage of peaceful civil disobedience because really,
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:45.920]  we don't really gather in large numbers anymore and it always gets covered. So it's funny
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:50.320]  to see that every time it happens, there's always somebody trying to get everyone to
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:55.680]  get angry and get upset, make us look dumb and bad. And so those are the people I usually
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.720]  pay attention to because I think either they're not familiar with what the new world order
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:06.640]  wants us to look like or look bad, or they're just dumb. And it's nothing personal, but
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:10.680]  you know, that's why it's so important that we remain peaceful. We do, we have, you know,
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:15.600]  speakers, we have events. We actually try to go to the media. We try to do maybe a march.
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:20.200]  We wear shirts. We walk with banners. You do something with a message so that people
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.040]  can hear what you believe and then you create change. But nobody's going to listen to anybody
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:30.120]  who's creating violence or creating havoc or just upset. They're just going to think
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:34.640]  that that person needs to be, you know, well, the average person I'm thinking here is what
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:39.720]  they think that person needs to be, you know, beaten into submission. And surprisingly,
[1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:43.080]  that's almost always what happens in those kinds of situations.
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:47.160]  Well, they would want a reason to let off rubber bullets. They want a reason to throw
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:52.400]  out the gas cans. And you're right. There are those people out there that have just awoken
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:57.680]  to the fact that this administration is evil, that they're liars and they, they're ignorant
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:01.680]  to the other facts that previous administrations have been this evil. They've just been slicker
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:05.880]  that it's not about Republican or Democrat. You know, they just know they're mad. And
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:09.880]  what they do is the, for instance, my buddy, Nate out in Colorado, one of his good or not
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:14.440]  Colorado out in Portland, one of his good friends, got this email. He's like, yeah,
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:18.840]  I'm going, go recreate 68. And he brought that up with me. He's like, yeah, he says
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:22.320]  he's going to this thing. And I said, you better warn him that this is going to be a
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:26.720]  provocative event. And I sent him the website with the shields and he's like, oh my God,
[1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:30.800]  you know, this isn't the right thing. So it's very easy for them to suck in the ignorant
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:35.240]  masses that just know that something's wrong. And these people genuinely think they're doing
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:40.040]  something positive. They're trying to bring change when in fact they're going to be just
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:44.880]  another part of this controlled paradigm in order to make movements like ours, Jonathan,
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:45.880]  look awful.
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:50.600]  Right. And they'll make us look violent. They'll make us look bad. And when peace protests
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:55.320]  break out in violence, I mean, this empowers the police state and it's used as a pretext
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:46:01.560]  to further bolster imperialist philosophies. Peace organizations have worked so hard to
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:08.600]  curtail in our society. Our concern is legitimate that the DNC will be provoked towards violence.
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:14.200]  Our evidence is the statements made by these organizations, their own websites, past actions,
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:19.920]  and it's all presented in articles I released. I was attacked personally almost immediately
[1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:26.960]  for even, even having any dissent against these groups or having a different opinion.
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:32.640]  And I've had people confront me and they've read the attack articles against me and they
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:37.320]  are not familiar with my articles or my proof or my evidence. And they're like, oh, you
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:41.600]  know, I've heard this and the other about you and you need to shut up and you need
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:49.680]  to stop talking about this. And it's amazing because you can really see the power that
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:54.120]  the collective masses really have when they don't pay attention to what they're doing.
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:59.920]  The power of disinformation, Jonathan. Oh, yeah. And it's almost kind of intimidating
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:05.800]  and scary at points because, you know, I, for a while there, I was kind of refuddling
[1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:09.560]  those attack articles, but they just kept coming and coming and emails kept coming
[1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:13.920]  and coming. So I decided to take the high road and just walk and say, you know what,
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:18.680]  look, I said my piece, I blew the whistle. This is not about me. This is about whether
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:24.240]  or not people understand my message, which is be peaceful. You know, let's, let's pull
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:29.120]  our heads together. Let's do something, you know, correct. I'm not against activism in
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:34.760]  any way. I'm an activist myself. I'm just concerned for the safety of 911 truthers
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:40.520]  down there. I think that this is a great situation to make us look bad. And that's what I got
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:44.320]  when I went to the meetings. That's exactly what I felt. That's what I witnessed. And
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:50.760]  that's all I needed to back away from that group immediately. So, you know, that was
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:54.800]  just a sharing of my experience. And I, you did the right thing. I mean, you did the
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:58.680]  right thing and you, you exposed them and you're right. Look at the, look at the power
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:01.920]  of the mockingbirds, the people that aren't familiar with our information. They're not
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:05.840]  even going to take a look at the information. And that's why the mainstream media has been
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:11.360]  somewhat successful in suppressing 911 truth because the majority of Fox News viewers don't
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:18.080]  know what 911 truth is. Just what has been represented by those like Neil Cavuto and
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:23.920]  Bill O'Reilly and Sean Insanity and even Alan Combs. I'm not going to give him a pass,
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:27.360]  you know, just these talking heads and what they've said about 911 truth. They're not
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:30.640]  actually going to go onto our website and check out our evidence. They're not going
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:35.400]  to go to Google video and watch loose change final cup for free. You know, we're putting
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:41.040]  this stuff out there for free to the masses because our nation's on its last legs. If
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:45.320]  they carry out another false flag terror attack, God knows what they're going to do. The provisions
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:49.760]  for martial law are in place. In fact, a lot of people don't know this, Jonathan, but isn't
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:55.680]  it a fact that martial law was declared in Florida in the days before 911 when Jeb Bush
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:57.680]  was running that state?
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:04.120]  Yeah. Four days, four days before, if I'm not mistaken, he declares martial law.
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  How convenient.
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:09.520]  And yeah, you know, and there was so much that came out of Florida that would have required
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:14.560]  the military to overrule the police and their investigations, you know, because I guess that
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:23.360]  was needed. I mean, come on, this guy, what's so funny about, what's so funny about the
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:28.600]  declaring martial law in advance of 911 is all the evidence of all the whistleblowers
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:32.800]  that came out of Florida, all the FBI agents, all the people who knew like pop sticker and
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:38.680]  stuff who investigated Muhammad Ata, they knew almost immediately that there was going
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:43.560]  to be massive investigations into the, to the many months that I think over a year spent
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:49.400]  by some of the hijackers in Florida and had Jeb Bush not declared martial law, all that
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:52.760]  information would have came out because the press would have had carte blanche and went
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.880]  out and found out all this stuff.
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:58.280]  And once he declared martial law, well, that made it really easy for anyone who wanted
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:01.840]  to ask questions, they needed to be going to the military to get their answers. And
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:08.160]  we all know the military follows orders under national security special under martial
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:13.120]  law, under martial law, anything goes. So really, that just meant that Jeb Bush is going
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  to give you your information from now on. Don't even bother looking into anything.
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:21.480]  And he also set up a safe house really for his, his brother, you know, the attacks take
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:24.240]  place and his brothers in Florida. What a coincidence.
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:29.600]  Oh, we're talking to Jonathan Ellen off of we are change Colorado. This is the Alex

[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:33.880]  We're talking to Jonathan Elanoff of We Are Change Colorado and TruthAlliance.net.
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:35.200]  And Jonathan has done some great things.
[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:40.320]  I mean, from the confrontations with Gary Hart to his articles about urban moving systems,
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:44.120]  this kid, I shouldn't call him a kid, he's a young man, just a little bit younger than
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.200]  myself, has done it all.
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:50.240]  And yesterday, I don't know if you were tuned in, Jonathan, but I went over some of your
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:57.160]  urban moving systems information and how one of these vans actually had exploded just down
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:02.080]  the road from the World Trade Center site somewhere on King Street between 6th and 7th
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:07.120]  Street, and that they were following a flatbed truck that had been rented to some Middle
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:11.760]  Easterners with the attacks actually painted as a mural on the truck.
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  Amazing stuff.
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:13.760]  Yeah.
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:21.360]  In the article, I kind of detailed that van with the mural on it, and it was.
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:27.360]  Even in the saving city lifeline, which was a transportation policy studies report released
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:33.160]  by Norman Mineta in 2006, he actually even confirmed that that van with the mural on
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:34.160]  it existed.
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:38.440]  In that report, it stated that there were continuing moments of alarm, a panel truck
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:43.280]  with a painting of a plane flying into the World Trade Center was stopped near the temporary
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  command post.
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:49.080]  It proved to be rented to a group of ethnic Middle Eastern people who did not speak English,
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:53.000]  fearing that it might be a truck bomb, the NYPD immediately evacuated the area, called
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.360]  out the bomb squad and detained the occupant until a thorough search was made, and the
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:59.160]  vehicle was found to be a delivery truck.
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:04.120]  Now, that's taken directly from that report, and it was made available in the van.
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  The article.
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:10.280]  So, you know, when I wrote that article, I was looking for any information on a page.
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:15.760]  If Mineta says that there's vans with explosives in it, and there's paintings of planes flying
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:20.680]  into the Trade Center towers, there's got to be police reports out there.
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:25.080]  And luckily, someone a while back, I'm not sure how long ago, but somebody posted a
[1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:32.200]  torrent of all of the audio from the police radio that day that was released to the public,
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:36.600]  including the fire department, the website that dedicated to the fire department, audio
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.600]  files.
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:41.800]  So, I downloaded that and listened and listened for hours, and I mean, I couldn't believe
[1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:47.960]  how many times I heard vans and stories about vans, and it was like, how come I've never
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:48.960]  heard about this?
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:51.720]  And the more I started looking into it, the more I actually started finding what I was
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:54.360]  looking for, it was just well buried.
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:58.360]  So, and this van is separate from the van that was pulled over by the George Washington
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:03.000]  Bridge that was supposedly full of explosives, the story then changes, that it set off the
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:06.840]  dogs and there was no explosives in it, but it tested positive for explosives.
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:10.720]  We're going to get into that and more with Jonathan Ellen off of We Are Changed Colorado.
[1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:39.200]  Through this, it is The Alex Jones Show and ForWars.com.

[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:54.960]  destroys the official fable forever.

[1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:04.040]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:59:04.040 --> 1:59:06.000]  crime are brought to justice.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.440]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:13.920]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change

[2:00:49.560 --> 2:00:54.360]  Right now, I'm talking to Jonathan Elenoth of We Are Changed Colorado, and we're discussing
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:56.840]  a lot of these vans now.
[2:00:56.840 --> 2:00:59.640]  These vans on 9-11, there was two big reports.
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:04.600]  There was the report of the one line with explosives, and then there was the report of
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:08.040]  the three gentlemen who had taped the attack.
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:10.240]  It looks like they were both detained.
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:14.560]  When you look at the report, some of these people who were involved in this quote-unquote
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:19.360]  Israeli intelligence ring were detained prior to 9-11, and then even more were detained
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:22.480]  after 9-11, but they were all let go.
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:28.040]  It seems like urban moving systems, Amdox, Comverse, all this has gone by the wayside,
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:32.280]  and it's just not discussed at all, Jonathan, but now we find out there were even more vans
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:35.400]  and a suspicious mural-painted truck.
[2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:40.760]  Right, and the truck with the mural on it was described as a moving truck.
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:46.040]  Some have suggested that it might be the same van that was owned by urban moving systems
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:48.120]  that now they own multiple vans.
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:53.640]  That hasn't been confirmed, but that's something I'd like to ask Dominic Souter, who was the
[2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:55.840]  owner of the urban moving systems.
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:01.680]  He employed these guys that were celebrating the attacks on New York and filming them,
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:03.440]  and those names were released.
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:06.720]  We have those names of those guys.
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:12.400]  I have a film coming out, as you know, that's going to be detailing all of this information
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:16.280]  and, of course, some new footage of building 7 and some other interviews that people haven't
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:23.360]  seen yet, and hopefully we can really get some questions answered because, I mean, anybody
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:29.920]  who's driving around on 9-11 with a van, with a mural on it, basically showing what's going
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:34.720]  on that day, should be questioned, I mean, to say the least, and why we know nothing
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:41.640]  about this, I mean, just only raises my curiosity, and I'm sure there's a long list of questions
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:44.920]  we all want to ask them, but yeah, in the police radio, they even reported a couple
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:48.880]  of times that a truck had actually exploded.
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:52.600]  One van had actually already blown up, and I was able to determine that actually the
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:57.720]  FBI, originally on that day, for a short period, was releasing statements, and I found
[2:02:57.720 --> 2:03:03.200]  USA Today and the NBC and CNN all releasing this, that they believed that there was a
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:08.720]  car or truck that was in the basement in the parking garage that had also exploded, aside
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:13.440]  from the explosives heard in the building and the plane hitting it, so the FBI at one point
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.760]  actually confirmed this story to be legitimate.
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:20.280]  They said it was the working theory at the time.
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:22.040]  Right, exactly.
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:28.040]  So I'm, you know, we're not alone in this, that these vans were, you know, people were
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:32.600]  conscious of these vans, so I want to know why the FBI released that report, what information
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:37.600]  they were going on because they haven't released their intel, and why they changed it, so suddenly
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:42.640]  who made that decision, I mean, if this is an issue of orders, somebody needs to be held
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:48.160]  accountable, but the direction was changed deliberately that day away from these vans,
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:52.640]  so that we would basically avoid hearing about them.
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:57.600]  And you can kind of, as you watch, and you've seen all the footage, so you know, as you
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:04:02.160]  watch the day unfold throughout 9-11, you can see the direction of the media, which
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:07.440]  is, for the most part, looking at it as, you know, they're looking for bombs, they're
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:11.000]  looking for explosives, these vans are an interesting story, Dan Rather covers it at
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:16.560]  one point, CNN covers it a little bit later in the evening, and then all of a sudden just
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:22.000]  an immediate change, a 180, and some news reports are saying the exact opposite information.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.640]  Absolutely, you know, and on that day they're blaming Bin Laden all over the place, every
[2:04:26.640 --> 2:04:30.200]  mainstream network I know, Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Bin Laden, we already know it's
[2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:31.200]  Bin Laden.
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:36.400]  Well, we'll be back after this with Jonathan Ellenoff of We Are Changed Colorado, it is
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:48.280]  the Alex Jones show.
[2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:52.360]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:56.320]  sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:04:56.320 --> 2:04:59.960]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[2:04:59.960 --> 2:05:04.060]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order
[2:05:04.060 --> 2:05:08.480]  master plan, we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet
[2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:09.480]  this threat.
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:14.760]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:20.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information, all 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded

[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:25.280]  others.
[2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:29.360]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:30.800]  online video library.

[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:35.960]  more.
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:41.720]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free, join PrisonPlanet.tv, burn the Info bombs
[2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:48.720]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the New World Order, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:52.840]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:56.840]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[2:05:56.840 --> 2:06:01.040]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are
[2:06:01.040 --> 2:06:02.640]  absorbed into the skin.
[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:07.320]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to

[2:07:49.640 --> 2:07:56.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:07:56.200 --> 2:08:04.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:11.880]  Alright folks, we are back. Alex Jones, Chantilly, Virginia, the Bilderberg meeting. He's going
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:16.160]  to be popping in hopefully in the third hour. We're also going to be taking your calls.
[2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:22.560]  In the third hour, right now, we have Jonathan Elenoff of We Are Change, Colorado. Jonathan,
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:27.880]  you've been in this for quite some time, the anti-globalist movement, the anti-New World
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:34.360]  Order movement. When did you decide that Colorado needs a chapter of We Are Change, and I'm
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:39.280]  going to be the guy, I'm going to be the go-to guy. I'm going to put this thing together.
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:47.000]  Well, actually, I originally had just kind of been dabbing around in the local 9-11 visibility
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:52.520]  group here under Michael Wolsey and the Colorado 9-11 visibility group, which is a great group,
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:09:01.080]  a bunch of great people there, nice people. It was through that that I had met Jason Charles,
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:07.880]  Truthline, and we got a chance to meet up with Rob and Josh and Nick and Adam and Shannon
[2:09:07.880 --> 2:09:12.720]  and all the other founders of We Are Change, Colorado. Basically, they had this vision
[2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:21.360]  of bringing We Are Change to Colorado. It just kind of manifested. With the help and
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:26.920]  the great work of these people out here in Colorado, the names I just mentioned, we
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:33.560]  made it happen. I'm just so honored to know these guys and to be on the battle lines with
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:42.800]  them. I didn't really ever see myself as becoming a hardcore activist when I was younger. I
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:51.160]  did know that I would inevitably fight for what I believed in because growing up, I was
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:57.000]  in this stuff in the 90s. I used to read conspiracy books and stuff like that. I used to read
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:02.560]  people like David Ike, who was not popular by any means in this movement, and he was
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:06.240]  actually one of the people who turned me on to this stuff. I came across Alex Jones, and
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:13.400]  then I just basically immediately was just completely behind the movement and total support.
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:19.640]  Of course, I worked all the time. I always knew that my place in this battlefield, which
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:21.840]  was to fight on the side of Truth.
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:27.440]  I feel like all of us have a place on this battlefield who crave freedom, who crave the
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:32.440]  bill of rights and constitution, who want a government, foreign by the people again.
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:38.080]  Those are the people that need to wake up, and people need to realize you do have power.
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:43.880]  We are all very powerful beings. Jonathan has been able to confront some of the big wigs
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:48.200]  on this, most notably Gary Hart. That's probably my favorite one from We Are Changed Colorado,
[2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:51.200]  but that's not it. I mean, you've gone much further than that, haven't you, Jonathan?
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:56.040]  Oh, yeah. We've gotten Bill Clinton. We got national press coverage for our competition
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:11:01.320]  with Bill Clinton. We just recently confronted McCain. Unfortunately, we're not going to
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:06.720]  be able to have a video on that. I did talk to the person who had camera footage. We
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:11.000]  have some of the speech. I don't think we have anything of anything else. But we did
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:15.600]  also, we just confronted the Denver Water Board again on water floor adation, and actually
[2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:22.800]  we were attacked by some private attorney who showed up and declared us a crazy conspiracy
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:27.320]  theorist. It was actually entertaining. That video will be up shortly, which actually,
[2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:31.680]  it kind of brings me to a whole other point. My YouTube channel had been disabled a while
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:38.640]  back, about a month back, and I've been permanently banned from YouTube for some convenient reason.
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:43.800]  So we've had to resort to relying to friends and other people to post our videos. So if
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:47.560]  people are wondering why they haven't been able to see our videos in a while, that's
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:48.560]  the reason why.
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:52.400]  Well, you gotta understand, these people are going to combat us in every way possible,
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:58.680]  and I truly believe the reshaping of Google video, for instance, was in large part to
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:02.920]  the popularity of movies like Loose Change and Zeitgeist and other Patriot films like
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:07.800]  America Freedom to Fascism, where they used to have a top 100 on the front page. It was
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:13.480]  very easily navigatable. People could look at the views that were on there, and then
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:17.120]  we got a little too popular, and they started resetting our views, and they started taking
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:22.920]  us off the top 100, and then they started taking out Embed as an option. And now they
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:28.520]  show you the top 10 or 15 videos in a specialized location. They don't show you how many views
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:33.560]  there are. They won't allow you to embed new videos. It seems like they're controlling
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:40.000]  this paradigm on the internet a little bit more strongly because it was able to infiltrate
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:44.840]  the mainstream, because it was able to reach millions and millions of people and spread
[2:12:44.840 --> 2:12:52.040]  this message like wildfire. And you know, it's not a shock when they pull down your YouTube
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:56.160]  or they pull down. I believe another YouTube account was just pulled down the other day
[2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:02.320]  because someone posted the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show where he showed the handlebars
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:06.920]  video, and they didn't just tell him to take that down. They just deleted his entire account
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:12.280]  without any notification whatsoever, and they said it was due to that video. But really,
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:16.360]  that's fair use. I mean, Alex had them on the show. You know, he has a small little
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:21.840]  TV program. That's like taking fuses off the air because they didn't interview with these
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:24.720]  guys and showed a portion of the video. It's absolutely ludicrous.
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:32.120]  Yeah, that is ludicrous. It's ridiculous. That's exactly what I had experienced. It's
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:37.840]  been fun confronting, I mean, we've confronted people like Giuliani, Romney, Ashcroft, and
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:43.160]  all these videos are basically off of YouTube right now. We do still have them. We are going
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:50.760]  to get them backed up, and I'm showing some of them in my film. But you know, this whole
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:55.760]  battle, which is basically an internet war of information, because I mean, let's face
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.080]  it, 90% of the people in this movement have found out about this, either from a DVD that
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:05.200]  somebody handed them or a website that somebody sent them to or that they ended up on. So
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:09.280]  this and those DVDs, by the way, come from ordering them on the internet. You're not
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:15.040]  getting them in Barnes & Noble. You're not buying them. You're not renting them at Blockbuster.
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:21.960]  This movement is solely dependent on communication between the internet and cell phone. It's
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:27.680]  grown to such a substantial size now that really the only thing they can do is try to
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:31.880]  attack us through the internet, which is funny that that's where we're seeing the battle.
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:37.160]  So I'm not surprised one bit when I see this stuff manifest before our eyes on the internet
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:42.160]  because, for example, I see disinformation all the time on the internet. It's one of
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:51.560]  the great tragedies of this movement, which is that the people who know the information
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:59.840]  get basically censored and moved aside. And then at the forefront, I see videos with tons
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:05.080]  of hits on YouTube that are complete disinformation. I've seen it all the time. I'm not going to
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:11.840]  name names, but I'm sure you're familiar with this. Sure, it's the laser beam, no plain
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:18.120]  whack job crowd that wants to put out a thousand videos and claim that we're somehow censoring
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:26.080]  their ludicracy and imagination because there's no evidence to support any of this stuff.
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:32.760]  Overlaying videos on top of videos that are shot at different angles on different cameras
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:37.160]  with different lenses, guess what? You're going to yield different results. They're
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:44.440]  not going to just line up. This isn't Fantasyland where everything just overlays. It's so obvious
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:50.760]  to me that this stuff is disinfo and it makes me sick because, for instance, Howard Stern,
[2:15:50.760 --> 2:15:55.840]  he has Paula Gloria on his show for an hour long and she sounds completely and totally
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:16:04.240]  insane. When she brings up somebody who was waving in the impact hole, instead of explaining
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:08.960]  why that would be impossible for the official version, she goes, just think about it. Well,
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:14.240]  no, what you need to say if you have any sort of legitimacy whatsoever is, well, the official
[2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:20.880]  version is that the impact site, it's supposed to be between 15 and 1800 degrees to weaken
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:25.880]  this steel, yet we have people in the impact holes waving and we also have the, not the
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:30.000]  transcripts, not only the transcripts, but the audio of the firefighters who are in the
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:34.680]  impact hole saying they can knock down the fire with two hand lines. Okay, now think
[2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:40.000]  to yourself, if it was 1500 degrees, could a person stand there? No. If it was 1200
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:45.200]  degrees, could a person stand there? No. If it was 600 degrees, could a person stand there?
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:49.880]  The answer is no. That's like getting into a broiler. I mean, give me a break. And that's
[2:16:49.880 --> 2:16:54.960]  the point that needs to be made. And instead, they have coop jobs on there talking about
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:17:01.760]  no planes and plane hugging pedophiles, just nonsense, you know, and it makes me sick.
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:07.480]  But at the same time, you've got to realize, what's that? And those videos don't get pulled.
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:11.400]  Oh, no, those videos are going to be, not only do they not get pulled, they get promoted
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:17.760]  by the mainstream. The mainstream can't wait to say something like no planes hit the towers.
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:23.720]  You know, I'll never forget when Morgan Reynolds went on Fox News and said, well, they're cartoons
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:28.520]  and I'm thinking to myself, all right, you're disinfo. This former Bush official, I had done
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:32.960]  an interview with him. He had really given some signs in that interview. I actually had
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:36.680]  done that interview with Alex and some of the crew over at Info Wars and he went off
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:42.360]  this tangent on OJ where he was doing slashing and stabbing and he had just grown this big
[2:17:42.360 --> 2:17:48.480]  weird mustache. And I'm like, what is this guy doing? And then he jumps into the loony
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:53.680]  bin crowd about cartoon planes. Listen, those people don't even know how special effects
[2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:58.680]  work. They don't know what a chroma key is. They, you know, from all the nonsense about
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:03.880]  West Cam and this and that projecting and, you know, Rick Siegel with his garbage on
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.600]  his, on his update of 9-Eleven Eyewitness. Look, I don't need these guys as friends.
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:11.560]  You know, I don't need these guys representing this movement. They're tearing this movement
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:16.920]  apart and they're the first ones to attack people. I shouldn't even be giving them this
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:21.440]  much of a forum, but people need to be aware that they're, that those videos aren't going
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:26.160]  to be pulled. Those videos are going to be promoted. Those videos are out there to try
[2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:30.000]  to discredit the entire movement and make us look all nuts. So when, you know, Jesse
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.920]  Ventura gets on Howard Stern and starts talking about, you know, the demolitions of one, two
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:39.320]  and seven and how he was in the, you know, underwater Navy demolitions team and he knows
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:44.160]  what a demolition looks like. They try to poo poo him, you know, or when Rosie O'Donnell
[2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:47.920]  was on there yesterday in an unprecedented event. Did you hear that yet?
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:48.920]  No.
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:53.640]  Yeah. She called in and she's been dogged on that show for 15, 20 years. I mean, like
[2:18:53.640 --> 2:18:56.960]  seriously dogged out on that show. As soon as she had that Rosie O'Donnell show, they've
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:01.840]  been all over her and she actually called in for the first time and this just shows
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:07.320]  what the awareness is. You know, Stern gets a ton of emails about 9-Eleven Truth. So he's
[2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:10.880]  well aware that Rosie O'Donnell has questioned the official version and we played the clip
[2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:16.440]  yesterday and she brought up, you know, one, two, seven. She said that, you know, you should
[2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:20.520]  have Willie Rodriguez on there, explained his story. Stern promised to have Rodriguez
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:25.120]  on. So we will see. Let's take some calls in the next segment, Jonathan, before I let
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:29.640]  you go. And, uh, and then we're going to take calls in the final hour. This is the Alex
[2:19:29.640 --> 2:19:53.400]  Jones show. I am Jason Burmist info wars.com. It is a big idea, a new world order in the
[2:19:53.400 --> 2:20:00.400]  near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful government. It's known as the builder bird.

[2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:11.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:20:11.960 --> 2:20:20.440]  80% of humanity is at hand. Oh, the first time in history, the elites plan for world

[2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:10.520]  hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections. Now the government has
[2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:14.340]  published the document that sounds the alarm. That's right. The United States government
[2:21:14.340 --> 2:21:19.120]  accountability office, the GAO has published the long term fiscal outlook document. Clearly
[2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:23.440]  stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control. This will directly affect
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:29.440]  programs like social security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank deposits. Taxation and inflationary

[2:21:43.160 --> 2:21:53.880]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:56.840]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's
[2:21:56.840 --> 2:22:01.600]  fair for the American people. The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism,

[2:22:55.080 --> 2:22:59.600]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution
[2:22:59.600 --> 2:23:07.960]  of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion

[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:16.280]  All right. We are back, ladies and gentlemen. It is the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Bermas,
[2:24:16.280 --> 2:24:17.280]  subbing in for the week as Alex is down in Bilderberg in Chantilly, Virginia. We're going
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:20.720]  to take a couple of calls. We have Jonathan Ellenoff with us. I want to remind people
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:25.280]  of the InfoWars Money Bomb was a great success. We raised over $200,000. We're keeping it
[2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:30.320]  open until the end of the week. And on Friday, we're going to unveil the actual number, the
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:36.040]  final number of what we made so we can put this together, put this new television network
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:41.080]  together, this new show together, move into bigger offices and expand the operation. That
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:45.320]  being said, let's go to our first caller, Scott. You're live in Colorado. Scott, you're
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:46.320]  with us.
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:48.320]  Hey, Jason. How are you doing?
[2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:49.320]  Good.
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:25:00.000]  Hey, this might be a little premature on my end here. I just added something to YouTube
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:05.480]  in reference to a church here in Colorado Springs. They had a sign out front that was
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:11.960]  basically, it looked to me like one of the ministers was going to be preaching on Romans
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:12.960]  13.
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:17.480]  Give up your guns. Obey the government. It's God. Go to the camps.
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:23.640]  Exactly. Anyway, it might not be up yet on YouTube. I've put it up, but I can't get it
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:33.160]  to pull up via the search words, but it's listed under Freedom Church, Colorado Springs.
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:37.880]  So it'll come up eventually today. I don't know what they're doing. If I go into my own
[2:25:37.880 --> 2:25:41.560]  account, I can see it, but it won't pull it up under this.
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:47.000]  We'll definitely let us know. Shoot an email over to Aaron at infowars.com. Maybe we can
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.800]  do a story on it if not this week. Next week, I thank you for the call, Scott. Let's go
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:54.720]  to DJ in Florida. DJ, are you with us?
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:26:02.240]  Yeah. Hey, right here. Hey, look it. On your latest film, you had the corner of the American
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:07.120]  Express building with 300 ton piece of steel in it. Sure thing. I think it was what, 20
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:08.120]  stories up?
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:09.120]  Yep.
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:14.160]  Okay. Has anybody got any films of taking that out of that? That was, you know, I showed
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:20.400]  that just a special sequence to a lot of people that had more impact than the planes hitting
[2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:22.400]  the towers.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:29.120]  It's pretty wild stuff that it was actually been able to thrown that far in a supposed
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:33.760]  pancake collapse and embed itself into the side of this building. I'm not sure how they
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:37.600]  got that out. Jonathan, do you know how they got that out?
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:42.720]  You know, I've got a video from Steven Rosenbaum that shows the cranes pulling that out. I
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:47.640]  believe they actually had to build a crane. Just for construction site, they had to build
[2:26:47.640 --> 2:26:50.600]  up the crane and then they had to actually maneuver it out of there.
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:53.000]  Well, what a selling point that is.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think so too, but it's just one of the hundreds of points
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.480]  that we make in loose change final cut. And if you guys haven't seen it, you know, it's
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:05.480]  for free on Google video. DJ, I thank you for the call.
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:09.720]  You know, yeah, again, you know, you have this huge beam embedded 400 feet away from
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:14.080]  the World Trade Center into a building around the 20th floor and they have to build a special
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:16.560]  apparatus to take it out.
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:19.520]  Let's go to Betty in North Carolina. Betty, are you with us?
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:24.360]  Yes, I am. Hi, Jason. This is my first time calling in.
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:25.360]  Excellent.
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:32.800]  I've listed to Alex Jones' show now for over a year. And I was on vacation last April
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:39.320]  and a guy from Tennessee would tell me about it. So that's how I know. And I wanted to
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:46.760]  let you know that last year, September, I took my cat into the vets to get checked up.
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:50.040]  And there they asked me if I wanted to get her microchipped.
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:53.320]  It was a new thing, huh? You haven't heard about that.
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:54.320]  Yeah.
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:28:00.920]  Right. And I told him no way. Now, my question is, say if someone has to go into the hospital
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:07.320]  for like surgery operation, can they microchip somebody without their consent?
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:11.240]  I don't know if they can do it without their consent yet. The only ones that I can say
[2:28:11.240 --> 2:28:15.000]  that they can do it without their consent are military personnel. Basically, you don't
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.240]  have a choice. You either leave the military and be court-martialed and go to military
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:23.520]  prison or you have to take it. That's why earlier I was reading that article, how they
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:28.160]  had banned workers, or I'm sorry, employers from forcing people in Missouri to take the
[2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:32.120]  chip because this is a new popular thing. I suggest that you get on the internet, you
[2:28:32.120 --> 2:28:37.400]  go to YouTube, you type in Verichip. Actually, if you go to my blog, loosechange911.com,
[2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:42.760]  one of my really early blogs from, I believe, March or early April, I have about five or
[2:28:42.760 --> 2:28:47.680]  six videos of how far the chip has come, how it's being proposed by the Mexican government
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:53.000]  to chip, all illegal aliens. In other words, people who are from Guatemala and below to
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:57.120]  come into the country instead of a passport, they want to chip these people. Betty, I thank
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:00.560]  you for the call. Yeah, this is a brave new world, Jonathan, where they literally want
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:03.400]  to chip not just your pet but human beings.
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:09.320]  Oh, yeah. And I was going to say that they're chipping people without their consent in other
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:14.320]  countries. There's reports of that already coming out. If it's happening in the state,
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:20.320]  it would be happening against laws and stuff. But remember, people can be bought to do whatever
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:24.000]  they want. So I wouldn't put it past anybody. That's right, Jonathan. Thank you so much.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:29.760]  We are Change Colorado. Just a great group. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Jason Burmese.
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.400]  We're going to be back after this with Daniel Estalon, author of The True Story of the Builderberg

[2:31:48.760 --> 2:31:52.920]  Hello I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing. Vaccines
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:57.880]  included medicines kill more people every year than any illness. The cost of drug side effects
[2:31:57.880 --> 2:32:03.520]  in America is more than $200 billion annually with the worst toll taken by antibiotics. But
[2:32:03.520 --> 2:32:07.860]  there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret. Oxysilver, developed
[2:32:07.860 --> 2:32:13.120]  by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making
[2:32:13.120 --> 2:32:18.520]  deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete. Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:24.440]  immunity without drug toxicity. Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way. The oxygen
[2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:29.640]  becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers,
[2:32:29.640 --> 2:32:35.440]  and more. Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:46.760]  with oxysilver. Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829. That's 1-877-817-9829.
[2:32:46.760 --> 2:32:49.760]  Do it now.
[2:32:49.760 --> 2:33:04.760]  Look at your young men fighting. Look at your women crying. Look at your young men dying.
[2:33:04.760 --> 2:33:26.760]  The way they've always done before. Look at the hay we're breeding. Look at the fear
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:43.760]  we're feeding. Look at the lives we're leading. The way we've always done before.
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:48.760]  All right folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show. Alex, of course, in Chantilly,
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:53.160]  Virginia at the Builderbird meeting. Hopefully he'll be checking in in the next hour. If
[2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:57.880]  you missed any of the first hour with Alex and Jim Tucker, we'll be replaying that on
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:04.080]  a loop over at infowars.com. But now we have a real treat for you. We have Daniel Estalon,
[2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:08.360]  who is a best-selling international author about the Builderbird group. The true story
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:12.920]  of the Builderbird group. You can get that over at infowars.com, and he's heavily featured
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:19.200]  in Alex Jones' documentary Endgame, also available at infowars.com. We've got him for
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:21.800]  the next 30 minutes. Daniel, how are you?
[2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:27.280]  I'm very well. Thank you. I'm so fortunate I can't attend this year's Builderbird conference
[2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:30.920]  because, as a matter of fact, I was told by friends in the United States to stay away
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:38.680]  and stay out. Apparently, your homeland security was repairing quite a welcome party for me,
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:44.680]  and we just felt it would be better for me to stay away. And Alex and Jim Tucker, to take
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.880]  care of it on the right there in CETO now, of course, have all the access to information
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:54.880]  through our sources at the Builderbird conference as it is taking place as we speak.
[2:34:54.880 --> 2:35:00.120]  Yeah, and this is the first time it's been in Chantilly, Virginia since 2002, and in
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:04.640]  2002, I believe that that was the first Builderbird meeting after 9-11. This is where they set
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:11.560]  the policy to go into Iraq in 2003, and I made the point earlier that by having it in
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:17.120]  Washington, D.C., it gives them a lot more access to military personnel, Washington insiders
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:21.840]  and bureaucrats within the system to stop by just for maybe a short conference or a
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:25.720]  short meeting and not have to attend the entire weekend. What do you think?
[2:35:25.720 --> 2:35:29.720]  Well, actually, the way it usually works, and I do have access to documents which I
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:34.600]  publish, some of these documents, internal Builderbird documents, in my book The True
[2:35:34.600 --> 2:35:38.240]  Story, the Builderbird Group. The people who attend, they're required to stay for the
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:45.440]  entire weekend. It was an exception in 2002 when the former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:52.320]  was invited, what was told, made it to appear, and literally at the biggest spot of the
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:57.040]  Builderburgers, the European and the American delegations, went at it, told the Americans,
[2:35:57.040 --> 2:36:02.240]  of course, won an immediate war, and the Europeans were terrified, especially with a galvanized
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:07.680]  effort from the people in Europe who said in mass, no to war, more than 100 million
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:13.080]  people there in 2002 came out to say no to war, and Rumsfeld called in, and basically
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:16.760]  he promised half of the president of the United States that the war was going to be
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:23.080]  postponed until 2003, as it was as Jim Tucker and I reported back in 2002. But again, the
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:27.480]  people who attend, they must stay for the entire conference. I have documents in my
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:32.560]  book which actually state to the attendees that they're required to stay from Thursday
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:36.880]  through Saturday to participate in all the debates and the discussions.
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:42.040]  So what do you think is on the agenda this year? Obviously, we have the presidential
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:48.880]  race over in the United States. We have the invasion of Iran on the table. We have skyrocketing
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:54.000]  gas prices. We even have food rationing going on now in this country in New York. They're
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:58.760]  limiting the amount of rice and wheat that you can buy in certain stores. Are these
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:02.880]  going to be the topics they're discussing, or am I missing something? What do you think?
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:09.480]  You know, you pretty much are. Again, I already have the atel d'alam here, about 10,000 kilometers
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:12.800]  away from where the meeting is being held. I already know what these people are going
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:18.520]  to be talking about. And again, the number one item is the bill for workers' view on
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:23.880]  China as an inevitable strategic threat. Now, the states are working at a very high. For
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:29.560]  bill to go, the threat is to maintain its position of power and its status as an unchallenged
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:34.760]  shadow world government on the one hand, and also on the other hand, wholesale destruction
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:40.200]  of the homogenous nation, which in this case is China. And for the Chinese, the survival
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:44.680]  of its one party communist rule. And of course, what we're witnessing right now, the high
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:50.800]  oil prices, which are predicted back in 2005 after the meeting in Rotterdam, Germany, when
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:55.600]  I said that the oil is going to go to about $150 a barrel. Again, it's all on the internet.
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:59.840]  People can see it. And it's also in the true story of the deliver group and one of my deliver
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:07.520]  reports. I said back in 2005 that oil is going to go by $2,009, $250 a barrel. Why? Why are
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:12.160]  they doing this? Because again, for the Chinese, the only way they can maintain their double
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:18.080]  digit growth is through cheap oil. When the oil goes through the roof, it is going through
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:23.120]  the roof right now. And it's only going to go higher as the European Central Bank also
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.920]  warned and the European Parliament. Of course, these both organizations are members of the
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:32.920]  Build a Burger Eater Circle. We're witnessing right now the intent by the Build a Burger
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:38.200]  Eater to destroy the Chinese. Of course, it's a very dangerous game because both the United
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:42.920]  States and the Chinese and also the Russians have nuclear weapons. And again, the Chinese
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:48.920]  know exactly what is being done to them because the same thing was done about 20 years ago
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:55.040]  to the Russians only in the opposite directions. They reduced the oil prices dramatically. And
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:00.640]  the Russian, the Soviet economy then crumbled into oblivion. Russians had oil. They couldn't
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.600]  sell it for a lot of money, so they had no money. Now they're doing exactly the opposite
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:09.840]  with Chinese because the Chinese have no oil and they literally have to import most of
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:15.080]  it from abroad. So by pushing it higher, by manipulating the markets, which is exactly
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:20.640]  what is being done right now, they're manipulating the markets to get the oil to go to $150
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:25.720]  a barrel. So forget about cheap oil, cheap gasoline. It's only going to get higher and
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:29.080]  it's only going to be more expensive.
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:35.080]  In December, you had discussed that these elites were very concerned with the movement
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:39.360]  behind Ron Paul and the freedom movement and the fact that he was quite a popular candidate.
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:45.280]  He now has had a No. 1 New York Times bestselling book. Is he going to be on the agenda? Are
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:49.560]  they going to be discussing Ron Paul, his followers, this freedom movement? Do you think
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:50.560]  that's going to be on the table?
[2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:58.160]  No. Again, these are global issues and the Ron Paul might be discussed somewhat during
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:03.480]  lunch conversation or after cocktails, but they're not going to wait until people find
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:08.760]  talking about Ron Paul. And also, to most people, Ron Paul is not an issue and to the
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:13.680]  people, especially the American representatives who may consider Ron Paul an issue, they will
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:18.160]  discuss it in closed-door meetings behind closed doors so that most people won't be
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:22.720]  able to even know what is being said in this country because, again, there's one, the Build-A-Bird
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:28.720]  Conference where 120, 125 people meet and they hear what everybody thinks and then you
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:34.800]  have the steering committee, the inner circle, which is about 50, 60 people who attend annually
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:41.240]  all of these conferences and, of course, the biggest decisions, the long-range decisions
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:46.440]  that affect humanity made from behind the scenes by the 50, 60 people who have been
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:49.880]  attending civil liberties for decades and not generations.
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:53.840]  Well, it's become evident in this country that this administration definitely wants
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:41:01.200]  to go to war with Iran. We've taken over Afghanistan. We've taken over Iraq. If we were able to
[2:41:01.200 --> 2:41:05.480]  establish a presence in Iran and go into that country, take it over, it seems like we would
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:10.880]  be that much closer to controlling a sort of Eurasian Union. I mean, we're already friends
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:17.040]  with Saudi Arabia. Pakistan is supposedly our ally. Obviously, Israel is our ally as
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:22.080]  well. If they're able to get into Iran, do you think that'll be on the agenda forming
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:24.200]  some sort of a union towards globalization?
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:30.200]  You know, in 2005, again, when they met in Germany, I said Iran wars are the table. I've
[2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:34.960]  been saying Iran wars are the table for the past three or five years and I still say Iran
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:38.520]  wars are the table, although there are certain people within the American administration
[2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:42.440]  who are absolutely ignorant that said, I'm getting this war going before Bush is out
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:47.480]  of office. Iran war is off the table. I know you can't read my lips, but I'm saying it
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:51.920]  over and over again because, again, European build-up are drawn the line, the proverbial
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:56.080]  line in the sand, and they told the American delegation and the American government to
[2:41:56.080 --> 2:42:00.920]  stay out of there. And again, while the people, you can see that the Iran war is off the table
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:06.440]  by understanding the behind-the-scenes movement, especially in the United States elections.
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:11.640]  The Barack Obama nomination is really no surprise because, again, if you keep in mind that the
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:17.280]  men who control Obama, his controllers, and he's a man by the name of this big new Brzezinski,
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:22.000]  the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, he's one of the key members of the build-up
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:27.720]  of Brzezinski and, of course, one of the key people in the Land Institute, and it's Brzezinski
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:32.920]  who is organizing the new strategy. And the new strategy is Syria and Iran along with
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:38.080]  the enemies, the new enemies, at China, Russia, and Pakistan. And, again, the first solver
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:44.160]  in that new war was the assassination of Ben-Ajin Buto. You're witnessing right now a lot of
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:49.840]  overtures being made against the Russians, and, of course, the high oil prices is a key
[2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:53.760]  element in the war against China. And it's very, very interesting. It's one of the key
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:58.080]  sub-points to show it down because it just got all the form with a source. To be discussed
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:04.440]  about this year's bill, the Chinese vulnerability to economic attack. Now, Rand, again, Rand
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:11.160]  is a big new Brzezinski's domain, has just issued a secret report that stated unequivocally
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:23.080]  that, I quote, China is at a disadvantage if any economic partner can be turned into
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:28.600]  a political protracted struggle. Sorry, I'm just reading my chicken scribble. I can't
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:33.080]  quite see what it said. Anyway, so the point is, again, Rand is on the agenda. Brzezinski
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:38.440]  is there, and, again, the people who are leading this new attack into the near future are the
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:46.440]  same people. I think, basically, when if Obama is elected president, we might wish for the
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:52.760]  Google base of George W. Bush, because with Brzezinski's power as the man behind the throne,
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:57.200]  we might find it quite unfavorably the near future political events around the world.
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:01.760]  Absolutely. And Brzezinski is the guy who wrote the grand chess board and was responsible
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:06.640]  for funding the Mujahideen and really creating Al-Qaeda folks. I mean, just do a Google image
[2:44:06.640 --> 2:44:10.600]  search on Brzezinski, and you'll see him with the, quote, unquote, freedom fighters,
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:15.720]  and he's anything but a freedom fighter. He's a hardcore globalist. Now, you mentioned something
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:20.520]  that Pakistan is going to suddenly become the enemy, and that seems like sort of a flip
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:26.040]  from the last almost seven years since 9-11 when they were declared an ally. There was
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:32.040]  some rhetoric and some talk of Pakistan initially being an enemy. Colin Powell and others mentioned
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:38.080]  them. Joe Biden mentioned them, but then they decided to allow us to put our troops there
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:42.360]  for launch against other nations, and they've been defended even though it's been said
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:46.840]  bin Laden has been in the tribal lands for the last four or five years. So you're saying
[2:44:46.840 --> 2:44:51.320]  that now it's going to be a complete 180. The United States is going to consider Pakistan
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:55.120]  the enemy, and do you think that they're going to use this bin Laden propaganda as their
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:56.120]  tool?
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:45:00.120]  Well, again, if you look historically, especially though, we don't have to go very far in history.
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:05.880]  We just have to go back about two decades. They tried to destroy Russia by joining forces
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:10.280]  with the Chinese who, of course, were supporting the Taliban against the Russians and they
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:14.080]  destroyed the Soviet Union, almost wiped it off the map. Now they're doing the same thing
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:20.000]  against the Chinese, and of course, the greatest beneficiary of this entire orchestrated attack
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:25.960]  on the Chinese by pushing the oil prices up, of course, Russia, which is one of the second
[2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:30.360]  biggest oil producers in the world, and the same thing you're looking again. The interest
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:35.360]  changes, geopolitics change, and you have the Pakistanis who are American friends of
[2:45:35.360 --> 2:45:40.080]  or never really American friends. They were just friends of convenience. And now, again,
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:44.160]  who are the Chinese, who are the Americans, and build up what we're making overtures to
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:47.480]  all. They're making overtures to the Indians, who, of course, are the natural enemies of
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:48.480]  the Chinese.
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:54.520]  So, again, geopolitics in Asia is quite exciting and fascinating, and there are no men in the
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:45:59.560]  world who understand that more deathly than speaking Brzezinski would just happen to be
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:03.920]  the men behind the curtain controlling Barack Obama.
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:08.800]  So with Brzezinski's involvement with this Obama campaign, and now Obama getting the
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:13.480]  nomination yesterday, seemingly getting the nomination with Hillary bowing out, do you
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:18.840]  feel that he's going to keep his, quote, unquote, promises to end the war in Iraq? Are they
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:23.080]  going to redirect troops? What do you think? What do you think is the plan? How are they
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:24.080]  going to do this?
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:30.080]  Well, I don't know, because between now and November, a lot can still happen. And again,
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:34.080]  Ron Paul is still in the election. Nobody really pushed him out. And there's still
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:38.920]  a lot to be said, because again, for example, I just got back a couple of, well, last week
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:44.920]  I was in Cancun, in Mexico, at a very important international conference called PQI. A lot
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:49.040]  of people from around the world, especially the United States came, and again, it's kind
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:53.760]  of an untied, buildable movement. A lot of people have a lot of influence on the world
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:59.120]  stage in decision making. Some people attended very important secret meetings, representatives
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:05.200]  of private organizations from around the world came and offered their help. Multi-millionaires
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:10.400]  offered money to put up, you know, resistance for the buildable world plans. So there's
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:15.160]  a lot still to be said by the world community. Things are not going as quickly as Bilderberg
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:19.640]  would like them to go. They're going too fast, as far as we're concerned, but not nearly
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:24.280]  as fast as the buildableers wish. And between now and November, a lot can still happen.
[2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:29.400]  Again, John McCain is a very sick man, and I know there's no guarantee that he would
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:33.240]  make it to be the president of the United States. Of course, all this information is
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:38.600]  being well-hidden by the mainstream corporate press who, by the way, is attending a mass
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:42.720]  the buildable conference in Virginia. But that's another story for another day.
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.920]  Yeah, but they're attending as actual members. They're not attending to actually report on
[2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:48.920]  the Bilderberg group.
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:53.600]  That's exactly what I mean. They're there. They're part of it. Part of the group and
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:57.840]  obviously none of it is going to be heard in Europe or in the United States. Again,
[2:47:57.840 --> 2:48:02.760]  there's not a lot being said in Europe either, because most people see this as some kind
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:08.440]  of peripheral thing and some kind of a movement put forward by conspiracy theories. My book
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:13.480]  has dissipated the great extent of this, you know, particular theory of the buildable Rereda
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:18.280]  Cabal. But still, there's just too many people out there who unfortunately believe that what
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:22.480]  is on mainstream television on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:28.400]  Post is the truth and bad news, where unfortunately we know that the real news and the real truth
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:33.720]  can never, ever glean the pages of the leading American and the world preview articles all
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:38.800]  controlled by the same people who just happened to be members of the buildable circular circle.
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:44.040]  Well, there's no doubt within the last few years this stuff has exploded on the world
[2:48:44.040 --> 2:48:48.560]  stage and more and more people are actually waking up to the fact that Bilderberg does
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:53.520]  indeed exist. They do indeed set policy. And I think you can see that with even Bill Clinton
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:58.600]  now admitting that he attended Bilderberg and they indeed do set policy there. He denied
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:03.960]  that he was there to set any policy in the United States that he was there to discuss
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:08.200]  with some Europeans what was going to happen in Russia. But from, you know, the Bilderberg
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:11.740]  doesn't exist to the Bilderberg exists, but they don't do anything. It's just a weekend
[2:49:11.740 --> 2:49:16.440]  retreat to now they set policy. This is huge that we have these, you know, world leaders
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:18.760]  actually admitting to this.
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:23.280]  Well, it is a point, but again, I think not enough people are paying attention. I think,
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:26.800]  you know, we're really running out of time. The bigger opportunity to win this and turn
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:32.040]  this around is closing very quickly. So unless people wake up and get this straight and get
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:35.680]  this right, again, I've been saying this for a long time. I'm going to say this again.
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:40.320]  Take advantage of it is that the United States no longer has a country to call you wrong.
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:45.840]  Okay. You don't have a government that protects you. The Supreme Court doesn't work for you.
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:50.520]  The Congressmen and the senators are not there to protect your rights. You can have a constitution
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:54.640]  and you don't have a bill of rights. You have nothing. You don't have a flag and you don't
[2:49:54.640 --> 2:49:59.400]  have the national weapon. You can still sing along. It's no longer yours has been taken
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:05.000]  over and the war against terror is not against the terrorists, against us, the people. We,
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:09.960]  the people, especially the people who love freedom are the biggest enemy of the Bilderberg
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:14.960]  group, which is one of the reasons I can't go to this meeting because again, they would
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:19.000]  have loved to have me there because I would have apprehended. I would have been apprehended
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:22.640]  and obviously put a prison. So again, the war of terror is not against the terrorists,
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:27.840]  it's against us, the people. And we better get this straight and very, very quickly unless
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:32.400]  we want to join so many others in concentration camps around the world.

[2:53:46.360 --> 2:54:15.400]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:19.920]  Well, I think the most important thing is people have to understand how money works.
[2:54:19.920 --> 2:54:25.080]  That's one of the greatest concerns for anybody who wants to stay free. We don't understand
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:29.040]  debt and we don't understand money. We don't understand how to spend it and what we can
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:34.040]  do with it, and also how we can use the power of money to destroy billboard and nailcovers.
[2:54:34.040 --> 2:54:38.280]  For example, a few months ago, if you recall in England, there was a run on Northern Rock.
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:43.440]  That's one of the oldest banks in the United Kingdom. And again, it literally overnight
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:49.280]  several billion dollars worth of funds were taken out withdrawn by the people. An entire
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:53.920]  British system was alarmed. And obviously, the Bank of England, the Queen's Treasury,
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:55:01.160]  had to step in and save up any kind of destruction of the financial sector. This is one of the
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:05.920]  key things we must understand. If we withdraw the money from the banks and use the power
[2:55:05.920 --> 2:55:10.840]  of funds, and we can actually make that money work for us, what would the money work? We
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:15.480]  can withdraw it. Or we can buy precious metals, gold, silver. Silver is going to keep going
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:20.920]  up to about $35 or $40 an ounce. It's about $16 or $17. I don't know where it is at the
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:26.040]  moment, at least it was a couple of days ago. So that's always a very good investment.
[2:55:26.040 --> 2:55:31.280]  It asks for physical delivery of products. Because again, if you're buying paper gold,
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:35.840]  there's about five, six times more paper gold than the actual physical gold. That's one
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:41.080]  of the solutions. Working together with small communities, self-sustained communities, where
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:47.240]  we no longer need to rely on the system itself. Work outside the system. I know it's difficult
[2:55:47.240 --> 2:55:51.600]  to do that when you're living in big metropolitan such as New York City. But there's a lot of
[2:55:51.600 --> 2:55:57.360]  rural communities and more and more people, especially in Europe and in Canada as well,
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:01.880]  are moving to small, relocating to smaller areas, where there are fewer people, more
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:06.760]  rural land, and working together with other people. This is one way we can make this work.
[2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:10.160]  And obviously again, please get out of debt.
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:15.280]  Yeah, absolutely. They love you to be in debt so that they can take your home, your car,
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:19.840]  and really control the way that you live. And hard currency is the answer to that. Precious
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:24.640]  metals are going to maintain their value throughout history. They've maintained their
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:29.600]  value for thousands of years, folks. And gold and silver are always going to be a smart
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:34.840]  investment. In closing, Daniel, what do you think? How do we spread this information?
[2:56:34.840 --> 2:56:40.000]  Obviously, you're an author. I'm a documentary filmmaker. I'm trying to reach as many people
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  as possible. We obviously have to talk to our friends, our family members about this.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:48.560]  But when are we going to have the mainstream breakthrough? Will it ever come?
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:53.640]  Well, I don't think we need the mainstream. We can win this war, as Mike published to
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:59.560]  Chris Milligan says. We can win this war with pops and pans. There is no such thing as our
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:03.320]  confrontation because they will destroy us, because they're far more powerful than we
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:09.360]  are. But they're few of them, and we're many. There's over 6.5 billion people standing on
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:15.800]  our side. They have very few allies to choose from. I recall, please, that Giuliani tried
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:20.920]  to get his driver to be one of the people in the Homeland Security. That's how deep their
[2:57:20.920 --> 2:57:26.520]  talent base goes. We have 6.5 billion people to choose from. We have a lot of people on
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:31.120]  our side. What is important, when we speak and friends of friends speak to others to
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:36.760]  try to get them to join the fight, we've got to make sure we stay in the mainstream and
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:41.360]  we sound credible. Meaning that when people ask questions, because they will, because
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:46.840]  they're so new to so many people again, so few people can understand, how is it possible
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:51.760]  that such a small group of people control entire humanity? It's very important that
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:58.080]  when you explain it to others, what the explanation sounds sensible and credible, otherwise we
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:02.760]  will lose them. And this is the worst thing that could possibly happen to us. We need
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:08.040]  as many people on our side as possible. The window of opportunity is closing. And again,
[2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:12.840]  people will need to understand that what we're witnessing right now, this is not an accident.
[2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:18.320]  I saw this about 10 or 11 years ago. I told Alex, I think in December, that we're witnessing
[2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:22.520]  a tremendous destruction. It was a phrase in one of the Buildover Report.
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:26.520]  All right, Daniel. Thank you so much for joining us. His book is The True Story of the Buildover
[2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:27.520]  Club.

[2:58:38.560 --> 2:58:42.600]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national

[2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:52.280]  history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:56.160]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time
[2:58:56.160 --> 2:58:59.640]  frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[3:00:02.360 --> 3:00:07.280]  Alright folks, we are back for the fourth and final hour of the Alex Jones show. Remember
[3:00:07.280 --> 3:00:13.800]  we are live streaming television over at PrisonPlanet.tv. Hopefully Alex is going to be calling
[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:18.440]  in in this final hour. And we're going to be taking your calls. I'm not sure if we still
[3:00:18.440 --> 3:00:23.360]  have Mike in Montana on the line, but if we do, we're going to go to Mike right now.
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:29.960]  Mike, you're live on the Alex Jones show. Alright, let's go to Dave in California there.
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:30.960]  Dave, are you with us?
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:31.960]  Hi Jason.
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:32.960]  How you doing?
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:36.760]  Great job, man. I really like your format. It's a nice counterpoint to Alex's.
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:37.760]  Oh, thank you.
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:43.120]  Okay, I've got two quick things. YouTube, that seems like a natural dollar making opportunity
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:49.280]  to somebody who wants to invest in a freedom oriented movie sharing thing, something big.
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:55.200]  Anyway, put that out to the people out there that have got money, sure, not me. And I wanted
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:01:01.240]  just to remind everybody that 9-11 not only was an inside job, 9-11 still is an inside
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:06.000]  job. Everything that they're doing, hinges on 9-11, everything that they're telling
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:12.320]  us hinges on 9-11, and the cover-up continues to this day. So, you know, I appreciate the
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:16.440]  thought that 9-11 was an inside job, but everybody keeps getting told, oh no, that
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:21.520]  happened seven years ago, you know, but it's not only is an inside job, it's getting bigger
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:25.440]  and bigger all the time, and I think it's a weak point in their armor.
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:29.320]  Well, absolutely, it is the weakest point in their armor, because again, this was documented
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:34.000]  on thousands of cameras on that day, and we have a news apparatus or had a news apparatus
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:39.480]  at that time, much larger than, you know, that of the era of the Kennedy assassination
[3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:44.000]  or the Gulf of Tonkin incident or the Vietnam War, and enough people were able to look at
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:48.600]  this information and say, hey, wait a minute, this is open source information, this is mainstream
[3:01:48.600 --> 3:01:53.760]  media, and this is contradicting, you know, this supposed official version of these 19
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:59.440]  guys in a cave, directed by Osama and Laden, that did this thing. And more and more people
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:04.080]  are waking up to it, and the reason that it's still so important, seven plus years later,
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:08.000]  it's not seven years later, yeah, but it will be, it'll be before we blink, folks, I mean,
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:13.120]  the summer's gonna end, September 11th, 2008 will be here, it'll be seven years on, is
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:18.080]  because it still makes the front page of the paper, you still hear about the post 9-11
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:22.640]  world, it's still the excuse for the Patriot Acts, for the Military Commissions Act, for
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:27.880]  Homeland Security, which is a totally corrupt organization that is unnecessary, it has nothing
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:34.760]  to do with our security, it has everything to do with, you know, the elite power security,
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:39.000]  the establishment security, to keep that into place. If Homeland Security were real, we
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:42.960]  would have secured the borders, but we did no such thing, and you know, it's all about
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:48.760]  cronyism, I don't trust the fact that Michael Chertoff is heading up that organization,
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:52.880]  and we need to wake up more minds, man, we just gotta keep pushing on and pushing forward,
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:54.360]  and you know, I hope you're doing that.
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:59.440]  Yeah, I am, here in the local area, I push it real hard, I can't get out much, but definitely
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:04.280]  done a lot of stuff around here, and I do see people waking up a lot more than even
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:05.280]  a year ago.
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:08.520]  Well, I agree with you there, and I thank you for the call, we're gonna jump to the
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:13.200]  next caller, it's supposedly Justin in Texas, but I'm gonna guess it's not Justin in Texas,
[3:03:13.200 --> 3:03:14.920]  it's somebody else, go ahead Justin.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:17.200]  Hi, Jason, good to talk to you again.
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:18.200]  Oh, it is.
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:22.440]  I was just calling up to hopefully get in some comments about controlled demolitions
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:24.440]  and your thought on that.
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:25.440]  Sure.
[3:03:25.440 --> 3:03:31.400]  Yeah, I was wondering, if during the mechanism of collapse on the World Trade Center towers,
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:37.560]  they both initiated at the same point of impact as the airplanes, right, okay, so how could
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:42.080]  it have been that the controlled demolitions incorporated that you guys supposed did the
[3:03:42.080 --> 3:03:43.080]  attacks on that?
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:48.080]  I never said CDI did the attacks, hold on, all right, hold on, I'm gonna give you every
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:52.800]  opportunity to talk, but when you misquote me, I have to correct you, CDI was commissioned
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:56.880]  to clean it up, that's all I've ever said, okay, CDI came in and cleaned that up, they
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:02.040]  cleaned up, also Oklahoma City, all right, and now your question is, well, how could
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:05.160]  the demolition be at the impacts of these planes?
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:09.960]  Those entire buildings were rigged for demolition, in other words, the top 20 floors above the
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:14.600]  impact were also rigged for demolitions, that's why there's not a huge 20 story part of the
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:17.720]  World Trade Center on the ground, because if it had tipped over, that's what you would
[3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:23.520]  have seen, you can clearly see squibs going off 20, 40, and 60 floors below the supposed
[3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:27.880]  collapse initiation point, and we'll get into more of it on the other side, this is the
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:46.200]  Alex Jones show, hold the caller over, infowars.com, prismplanet.com.
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:50.400]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:56.160]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government, it's known as
[3:04:56.160 --> 3:05:01.000]  the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:06.400]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[3:05:06.400 --> 3:05:14.480]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:19.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open,
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:23.880]  you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:05:23.880 --> 3:05:26.520]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:29.680]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[3:05:29.680 --> 3:05:31.880]  they're after power, that's their after vision.
[3:05:31.880 --> 3:05:38.280]  Order in game on DVD at prismplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right now
[3:05:38.280 --> 3:05:39.280]  at prismplanet.tv.
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:44.280]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[3:05:44.280 --> 3:05:48.200]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:52.640]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days, many will be deceived.
[3:05:52.640 --> 3:05:56.240]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[3:05:56.240 --> 3:05:59.920]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[3:05:59.920 --> 3:06:03.840]  Is the beast a superpower nation, or a giant computer in Belgium?
[3:06:03.840 --> 3:06:09.080]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[3:06:09.080 --> 3:06:12.160]  Is the antichrist a person, title, or both?
[3:06:12.160 --> 3:06:15.960]  Some believe these things are in the future, others believe that it's in the past.
[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:19.360]  First John states, the antichrist is already in the world.
[3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:21.440]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:23.760]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:25.880]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[3:06:25.880 --> 3:06:31.360]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies, exposing the antichrist, the beast, and its mark, right
[3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:41.240]  to the Bible says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771, or call 888-211-1715.
[3:06:41.240 --> 3:06:48.360]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:51.800]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[3:06:51.800 --> 3:06:56.560]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:01.800]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[3:07:01.800 --> 3:07:06.120]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:11.400]  all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:16.240]  chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:19.880]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:24.840]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[3:07:24.840 --> 3:07:29.920]  Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong?
[3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:30.920]  Decide now.
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:32.520]  Place your bet.
[3:07:32.520 --> 3:07:34.280]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[3:07:34.280 --> 3:07:40.080]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:46.080]  Call 800-409-5633.
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:48.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:07:48.640 --> 3:07:51.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:51.960 --> 3:07:54.280]  All right, we are back.
[3:07:54.280 --> 3:07:55.280]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[3:07:55.280 --> 3:08:00.400]  I got a caller on the line asking about CDI's involvement in 9-11.
[3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:05.200]  Control Demolition Incorporated, run by the LaZoe family, has been a military contractor
[3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:06.200]  for years.
[3:08:06.200 --> 3:08:11.000]  They are one of the few control demolition companies out there that can take down a
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:13.120]  building, a large size building.
[3:08:13.120 --> 3:08:18.000]  I mean, there aren't that many control demolition businesses in this country.
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:21.480]  Again, they get government contracts all the time, their family run.
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:26.480]  I never said that they were the ones that rigged up the towers, but they were the ones
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:28.800]  responsible for cleaning up the towers.
[3:08:28.800 --> 3:08:30.520]  Now, quote unquote, Justin.
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:31.520]  Is that even your real name?
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:32.520]  Is it Dan or Justin, man?
[3:08:32.520 --> 3:08:33.680]  I mean, you're the same guy, right?
[3:08:33.680 --> 3:08:34.920]  My name is Justin.
[3:08:34.920 --> 3:08:40.200]  Alex knows my name is Justin because he called me back in my house to verify that.
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:44.520]  I just want to make a quick comment and then I could take your answer off the air.
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:49.800]  I just was thinking that if the impact of the planes hit at the exact initiated collapse
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:55.200]  point of the building, how would that be such a great guess from whoever set up the control
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:56.200]  demolition?
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:09:00.400]  I'll answer, I don't think it's a guess, number one.
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:04.160]  You see, all right, for instance, the second plane that goes into the building, you clearly
[3:09:04.160 --> 3:09:08.880]  see a demo charge go off outside of the explosion of the plane.
[3:09:08.880 --> 3:09:10.160]  It's in the center of the building.
[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:11.200]  It's a small squib.
[3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:12.400]  It looks just like the other squibs.
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:16.600]  Now, with the first strike of the World Trade Center, that plane, look up 20 floors.
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:18.440]  You'll see the exact same squib going off.
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:22.440]  You'll see another squib in the middle of the building pop out and the whole floor pop
[3:09:22.440 --> 3:09:24.160]  out around the 105th floor.
[3:09:24.160 --> 3:09:28.240]  I don't think the whole section of the top building falling though, I'm not talking about
[3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:29.240]  collapse.
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:30.240]  Hold on.
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:31.240]  Hold on.
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:32.240]  I'm not talking about collapse.
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:36.080]  I'm talking about when these planes hit those buildings that you could see squibs being
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:39.680]  knocked loose from the demolition charges that were placed in the buildings.
[3:09:39.680 --> 3:09:40.680]  That's what I'm saying.
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:41.680]  Okay.
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:43.800]  It just seems that there's a lot of floors that they would have had to load up with
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:44.800]  controlled demolitions.
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:48.800]  And I mean, I've heard you guys say that a couple of floors were restricted or there
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:49.800]  was limited access.
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:51.440]  Well, it wasn't a couple of floors, man.
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:53.960]  I mean, all right, let me talk on that for a second.
[3:09:53.960 --> 3:09:58.080]  I interviewed Gary Corbett in 2006 right before the anniversary.
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:09:59.080]  He worked in the buildings.
[3:09:59.080 --> 3:10:00.080]  He approached me.
[3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:01.480]  I didn't know who he was.
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:02.880]  He had gone to our site.
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:08.400]  He saw the Scott Forbes article that is now notorious where Scott Forbes claimed that
[3:10:08.400 --> 3:10:11.960]  certain floors were shut down in the weekend before the attacks and that they were given
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:14.360]  access to a new security system.
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:15.360]  Okay.
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:18.080]  Now, Gary Corbett comes up to me and he tells me the same exact story.
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:23.440]  He says that they were knocking down, I think something like three to four floors at a time
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:25.040]  powering them down, clearing them out.
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:28.840]  And he said that when he got there on Monday, he was very confused because this new security
[3:10:28.840 --> 3:10:30.200]  system wasn't working.
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:36.640]  And a lot of the businesses on the floors were upset because they couldn't get their
[3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:37.640]  security working.
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:39.440]  And he said it caused a big hubbub.
[3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:41.840]  People were being called in and out and people were unhappy.
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:43.600]  And of course, the attacks happened on Tuesday.
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:47.920]  Do I know that they rigged those buildings for demolition the weekend before?
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:10:49.320]  I don't know that.
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:55.480]  But I do know that John Gross is on camera saying that there was no molten metal at the
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:56.480]  scene.
[3:10:56.480 --> 3:10:59.280]  He said, well, let's go to your initial premise that there was molten metal on the scene.
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:00.280]  He denies it.
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:01.280]  He says no one reported it.
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:05.800]  Now, I've got probably half a dozen newspaper reports and then a loose change final cut.
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:11.080]  I think I have five to six witness, eyewitness accounts, including Ken Holden, who was on
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:15.080]  the scene before anybody who was part of FEMA and their team going around.
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.000]  He's talking about molten metal dripping from six.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:22.960]  Then he denies that the thermal imagery from NASA even exists.
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:23.960]  And that's a big problem for me.
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:27.800]  If he's not going to take a look at the thermal imagery that shows these extreme hot spots
[3:11:27.800 --> 3:11:32.280]  under one, two, seven, and even six, then I don't think he's credible.
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:36.320]  And then when he's asked about the rest of the collapse, he said, well, we didn't have
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:40.680]  to actually do any mathematics or equations for the rest of the collapse of the building
[3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:44.520]  because it's very evident what happened to those buildings on the videotape.
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:46.720]  Alls we had to describe was collapse initiation.
[3:11:46.720 --> 3:11:52.320]  Now you would think in a 10,000 page report, they could explain why the bottom 70 plus
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:54.520]  floors of each building turned to dust.
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:55.520]  Okay.
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:57.960]  Well, I have a lot more questions for you, but I appreciate the time you're giving me
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:11:58.960]  so far.
[3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:02.920]  And I just wanted to make a quick comment is recently within the last couple of days,
[3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:07.080]  I talked to somebody who was much wiser than myself who said, you're not going to get
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:08.240]  anywhere being a jerk.
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:11.360]  So I apologize for past marminess.
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:13.920]  And I hope you appreciate the more appropriate dialogue.
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:14.920]  I do.
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:15.920]  And I'm more than willing.
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:19.320]  I just want to put out that I'm more than willing to speak to my detractors on any level.
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:23.000]  You know, I've talked to the SLC guys, I've challenged them to debates.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:25.520]  They're not that they won't go on against me anymore.
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:28.640]  You know, Pat Curley has come on against me a couple of times, James B has never come
[3:12:28.640 --> 3:12:30.080]  on against me.
[3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:32.520]  But you know, any, I'll look at all the evidence, man.
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:36.040]  And I'm not in this for any other reason other than what I believe.
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:39.400]  And I do believe that this was an inside job and I'm very upset about it.
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:44.640]  It does not comfort me that I think I gave you the apology and I look forward to speaking
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:45.640]  with you in the future.
[3:12:45.640 --> 3:12:46.640]  All right, man.
[3:12:46.640 --> 3:12:47.640]  Have a good day.
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:48.640]  All right.
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:49.640]  Let's go to Joe in Indiana.
[3:12:49.640 --> 3:12:50.640]  Is Joe there?
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:12:51.640]  Hello, Jason.
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:52.640]  Hey, how you doing, Joe?
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:57.000]  First of all, that was a great job you did on the final cut.
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:58.800]  Oh, thank you, man.
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:04.320]  And for people like that last caller there, we could change the subject of 9-11 a little
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:05.320]  bit.
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:09.400]  But how can you have like the vice president of choice point and Eugene Clinton Curtis
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:13.720]  speak to members of Congress and that's not even on mainstream media?
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:16.720]  Well, enlighten me because I don't know anything about this.
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:17.720]  Oh, really?
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:18.720]  No.
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:20.600]  Hey, I'm not a God, man.
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:22.280]  I do a lot of research.
[3:13:22.280 --> 3:13:24.320]  I look at a lot of stuff.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:25.600]  You know, stuff slips by me.
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:26.960]  Please talk about choice point.
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:29.640]  Well, I do something on your level there.
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.240]  Can you explain, because I know in the second edition you put options, but on the final
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:36.840]  cut you didn't put that in there.
[3:13:36.840 --> 3:13:37.840]  Yes.
[3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:40.040]  Can you explain like exactly where?
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:43.640]  Well, the only reason that we didn't cover in the final cut is because it was covered
[3:13:43.640 --> 3:13:44.640]  in the second edition.
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:47.680]  And let's go over some of the insider trading on 9-11.
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:49.960]  Now, we have insider trading in Boeing Airlines.
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:53.400]  We have insider trading in American Airlines in the days before the attacks.
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:55.440]  Merrill Lynch, other U.S. companies.
[3:13:55.440 --> 3:14:00.680]  Now when this comes to light, the 9-11 commission covers it in a footnote and says, although
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:06.880]  it looks suspicious, it couldn't be insider trading because none of it was related to
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:07.880]  Al Qaeda.
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:11.880]  In other words, something like a billion plus of the insider trading went to one U.S.
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:14.240]  businessman who had no ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:16.480]  So it just had to be a coincidence.
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:21.760]  Now, Convar, and this is in the second edition, was commissioned to recover some of the hard
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:24.200]  drives that were in the rubble at the World Trade Center.
[3:14:24.200 --> 3:14:28.040]  We all know not everything was destroyed, and hard drives are actually pretty durable
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:29.040]  things.
[3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:30.280]  You know, it's on a piece of tape.
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:33.560]  If you put them into a clean room, you can get data off them.
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:37.080]  When they got the data off them, they said, wow, it looks like there were some people
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:41.080]  in the buildings who knew exactly when the planes were going to strike and moved out
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:43.960]  hundreds of millions of dollars prior to this.
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:49.200]  Now, when he was asked, the same man was called up a couple years later to confirm the story.
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:53.160]  He said, well, I'm not allowed to discuss that story because we've been bought up by
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:58.240]  Coral Associates, Coral Associates, of course, are the ones that were publicly running security
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:14:59.760]  on the World Trade Center.
[3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:02.640]  Okay, that's pretty suspicious.
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:06.000]  And he said, but if you had called me before they bought us, I'd probably give you the
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:07.360]  same answer.
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:12.720]  So now we have insider trading in the stock market, and then we have people on the inside
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:17.560]  of the World Trade Center complex itself moving out all this money in accordance with these
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  attacks.
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:20.960]  Obviously, U.S. interests were involved.
[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:21.960]  You have Larry Klayman.
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:26.560]  This is going to be in my new film of Joe Dishelwatch, who was representing Robert Wright, who tried
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:31.440]  to go forward before 9-11 and say, hey, I know how this money's moving, saying, well,
[3:15:31.440 --> 3:15:35.200]  the reason they're not talking about it is because this money was moving through some
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:40.760]  powerful U.S. banks in interest who had reason to know that they were dealing with terrorists.
[3:15:40.760 --> 3:15:45.600]  So you know, there's no doubt that there were U.S. interests involved, whether we're ever
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:49.960]  actually going to get that Convravar information or we're going to get an investigation into
[3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:51.040]  the insider trading.
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:52.480]  I don't know, man.
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:54.480]  Did I answer your question?
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:55.480]  That answers my question.
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:15:56.480]  All right, Joe.
[3:15:56.480 --> 3:15:57.680]  Thank you for the call.
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:15:59.800]  Let's go to Mike in Idaho.
[3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:00.800]  Mike, are you with us?
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:01.800]  Yes, I am.
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:07.000]  Hey, I appreciate all your hard work, and you're making a lot of people open their eyes.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:08.720]  Well, thank you, man.
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:12.800]  There's another thing you need to, you've heard about the peer report review, it just
[3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:13.800]  come out.
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:14.800]  Alex covered it.
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:15.800]  I'm not sure, no.
[3:16:15.800 --> 3:16:16.800]  Go ahead.
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:26.240]  Okay, it's from Beth Ham, Open Access, and what this is, it's a report, basically it's
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:29.000]  14 points of agreement with official government reports.
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:30.520]  Oh, the Stephen Jones paper.
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:35.800]  Yes, okay, now this is something that is serious ammunition.
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:41.000]  I just discussed this with somebody in the legislative body, and I am very well connected,
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:46.760]  and this is opening up some serious eyes, because this gives your film massive validity.
[3:16:46.760 --> 3:16:51.520]  Oh, absolutely, and you know, he's done another experiment, although his peer reviewed paper
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:58.600]  on the matter has not gotten the attention of this 14 points of agreement, but his paper
[3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:03.440]  on the molten metal that was pouring out of the World Trade Center prior to its collapse
[3:17:03.440 --> 3:17:08.480]  is amazing, because again, the official version would have us believe that there was no molten
[3:17:08.480 --> 3:17:09.480]  metal possible.
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:13.120]  Now, when this molten metal is caught on camera pouring out, what do the debunkers say?
[3:17:13.120 --> 3:17:16.400]  Well, that's obviously aluminum from the plane.
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:20.080]  Aluminum burns somewhere between 600 and 800 degrees before it's moltenized.
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:21.720]  Now, aluminum is silver.
[3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:26.360]  So Jones was good enough to go and do an experiment and say, all right, well, let's make some
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:31.880]  molten silver, or I'm sorry, molten aluminum, and see if it will mesh and make this color
[3:17:31.880 --> 3:17:35.560]  that this molten metal pouring out of the World Trade Center was, and it didn't do that.
[3:17:35.560 --> 3:17:39.720]  And a lot of people have now detracted the aluminum from the plane, now they're saying
[3:17:39.720 --> 3:17:40.720]  it's batteries.
[3:17:40.720 --> 3:17:45.880]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now, it is clearly molten iron or molten steel or
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:47.520]  a combination of both.
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:49.400]  This thing looks like a foundry.
[3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:52.600]  It literally pours down 60 plus floors and doesn't dissipate.
[3:17:52.600 --> 3:17:54.720]  Only molten metal would do that.
[3:17:54.720 --> 3:17:59.320]  And it's quite interesting, you know, I just woke up December and Ron Paul is one that
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:00.320]  woke me up.
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:07.040]  I feel very, very bad about what I've told other people a year ago, and I was a debunker
[3:18:07.040 --> 3:18:08.280]  in a manner of speaking.
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:10.520]  I could not believe my country could do this.
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:12.920]  Well, it's very difficult for the majority of us.
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:16.480]  I know when I first started to get into this about six months after the attacks, it was
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:21.360]  the last thing that I wanted to believe about my country, and that's why another one of
[3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:26.560]  those debunker arguments just doesn't hold water with me of, well, you know, these conspiratorial
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:31.120]  minds work in a fashion that they want the world to be this perfect place where our rulers
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:32.120]  control everything.
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:37.080]  No, man, I was way more comfortable thinking it was Muslims in a cave halfway across the
[3:18:37.080 --> 3:18:38.360]  world where we could bomb them.
[3:18:38.360 --> 3:18:43.840]  I am much more uncomfortable with elements within our own military industrial complex
[3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:46.880]  apparatus carrying out these attacks.
[3:18:46.880 --> 3:18:51.680]  And like you said, we just keep having more fuel to fire, I'm very happy to hear that
[3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:55.720]  you woke up in December because that tells me we can keep waking up more and more minds,
[3:18:55.720 --> 3:19:01.080]  and I just tell people, make copies of our films, hand them out, have movie night, talk
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:04.040]  to people like a human being, know your information.
[3:19:04.040 --> 3:19:09.240]  I mean, you're going to catch more flies with honey than any other way.
[3:19:09.240 --> 3:19:10.240]  Oh, definitely.
[3:19:10.240 --> 3:19:15.000]  And I'm very well connected also because I'm an armorer, and I deal with a lot of military
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:17.400]  and I deal with a lot of other people.
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:21.480]  And I'm also a veteran of the Navy and the Army and private military.
[3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:25.280]  Well, Mike, I thank you for waking up, thank you for the call.

[3:21:45.640 --> 3:21:49.840]  In the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:21:49.840 --> 3:21:52.320]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:57.400]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:22:00.440]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:22:00.440 --> 3:22:04.720]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:08.640]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:12.400]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[3:22:12.400 --> 3:22:13.640]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:22:13.640 --> 3:22:17.800]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:22.800]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:22:22.800 --> 3:22:24.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:28.920]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[3:22:28.920 --> 3:22:33.760]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[3:22:33.760 --> 3:22:36.840]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:49.440]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:50.800]  alkaline environment.
[3:22:50.800 --> 3:22:56.120]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[3:22:56.120 --> 3:23:00.560]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:01.560]  of disease.
[3:23:01.560 --> 3:23:06.400]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:07.400]  loss of weight.
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:12.040]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most
[3:23:12.040 --> 3:23:13.640]  people are overly acidic.
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:17.560]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:21.840]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[3:23:21.840 --> 3:23:22.840]  it.
[3:23:22.840 --> 3:23:26.400]  Do your part, alkalize, and supercharge your body now.
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:31.040]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[3:23:31.040 --> 3:23:35.200]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:41.520]  Consider your bottle of Alcovision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:24:07.320]  Again, that's alcovision.com.
[3:24:07.320 --> 3:24:08.320]  All right, folks.
[3:24:08.320 --> 3:24:09.520]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:13.840]  I am Jason Burma, subbing into the entire week as Alex takes on the Bilderbergers in
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:16.400]  Chantilly, Virginia.
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:22.360]  If you missed any of Alex's calling with Jim Tucker in the first hour, you can go to infowars.com.
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:26.440]  As soon as this broadcast is over, we replay it all day for free.
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:31.920]  There is a podcast, infowars.com, prismplanet.com.
[3:24:31.920 --> 3:24:35.960]  If you want to see the last hour video feed, you want to see my pretty little face on the
[3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:39.680]  radio, I guess, or my little shirt that I'm going to wear, I'll put this up there.
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:40.920]  Oh, investigate 9-11.
[3:24:40.920 --> 3:24:43.760]  You get that at my website, loosechange91.com.
[3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:46.000]  Become a PrismPlanet.tv subscriber.
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:49.880]  They have, I think, something like 40 to 50 documentaries on there now.
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:55.680]  All of Alex Jones's films, all of his big interviews on MP3, I mean, what you get with
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:25:00.600]  prismplanet.tv, which is about 15 cents a day, you're not going to get anywhere else.
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:02.240]  We really do need your support and help.
[3:25:02.240 --> 3:25:06.480]  That's why the Infowars Money Bomb is running until Friday, and we're going to be giving
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:08.320]  out the totals on that.
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:09.920]  We've made over $200,000.
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:14.040]  That's going to go towards a new office and a new television program, hopefully on Dish
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:15.040]  Network.
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:16.440]  We're really going to try to put it together, folks.
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:19.520]  It's not an easy task.
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:24.280]  I want to remind people I'm over at MySpace, MySpace.com, Jason Bermas, if you want to get
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:25.280]  at me.
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:26.360]  I do read my emails.
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:27.840]  I do check out my comments.
[3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:31.680]  I do not have an administrator running it, and I love to hear from you guys.
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:34.400]  So that being said, let's take some more callers.
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:36.400]  Let's go to Bob in Pennsylvania.
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:39.320]  Bob, are you with us?
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:40.320]  No, Bob?
[3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:41.320]  Yes, I'm here.
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:42.320]  Oh, how are you doing, Bob?
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:43.320]  Good.
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:50.280]  Jason, I wanted to ask you, whenever it happens, last year around this time, we were kind of
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:55.280]  told that there may be a theatrical release of Lose Change Final Cut.
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:25:58.880]  Is that still possibly on the table or whatever became that?
[3:25:58.880 --> 3:25:59.880]  Sure.
[3:25:59.880 --> 3:26:02.960]  I answered this question yesterday, but I'll answer it again today.
[3:26:02.960 --> 3:26:05.200]  Basically, we met with all these Hollywood types.
[3:26:05.200 --> 3:26:06.400]  We talked to people at Paramount.
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:07.800]  We talked to people at Lionsgate.
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:12.320]  The only people that were really interested in possibly putting this out was Mark Heuven's
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:15.320]  company, Magnolia, or 2929.
[3:26:15.320 --> 3:26:18.400]  We met with Charlie Sheen, who was all about the project.
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:23.080]  Unfortunately, when things were put onto paper, that paper said that we no longer owned the
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:28.560]  second edition, that we would have to get the second edition off the Internet in full,
[3:26:28.560 --> 3:26:33.440]  but there was no theatrical release guaranteed for the final cut that they would own both
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:34.440]  editions.
[3:26:34.440 --> 3:26:35.440]  They would try and scrub it.
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:36.440]  It's a very big possibility.
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:39.480]  I mean, if you look at the other pictures that they put out, they put out that film
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:43.000]  Redacted, which got some decent press, I guess.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:47.200]  It was against the Iraq War, but it opened in eight theaters, and it was out for two
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:49.720]  weeks, and it wasn't seen by anybody.
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:53.960]  So we saw that, and we said, well, how are we going to take our movie off the Internet?
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:56.680]  That's what made us big, and this is a completely separate movie.
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:01.920]  Why should we sell the rights to our completely separate movie to these people?
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:04.320]  And basically, things degraded from there.
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:06.720]  It did show up in theaters in the UK.
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:12.360]  Picture House carried it for a while, but it's very hard to get that kind of distribution.
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:16.280]  And unfortunately, I don't see us being able to do that.
[3:27:16.280 --> 3:27:19.880]  I mean, it's always a possibility where I'm always talking to people behind the scenes,
[3:27:19.880 --> 3:27:22.520]  but when it comes down to it, it's tough.
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:27.240]  Do you know anything about the film The Reflecting Pool?
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:28.560]  I haven't watched it yet.
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:31.680]  I actually do have a copy of that back in New York.
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:33.080]  I didn't know that's been out yet.
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:35.640]  I thought it was a pending release.
[3:27:35.640 --> 3:27:36.640]  I don't know.
[3:27:36.640 --> 3:27:37.640]  I think so.
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:38.640]  I got it on DVD.
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:41.440]  I mean, I might have got a pre-screener copy from the filmmakers.
[3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:46.600]  They sent it to Dylan, but I think you can get that on DVD right now.
[3:27:46.600 --> 3:27:49.680]  I have not watched it, so I really can't give an opinion on it.
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:53.000]  Okay, well, thank you very much, and you're doing a great job.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:54.000]  Well, thanks, Bob.
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:55.520]  I appreciate the support.
[3:27:55.520 --> 3:27:57.320]  Let's go to Graham in Seattle.
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:27:58.960]  Graham, are you with us?
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:01.520]  Okay, so then let's go to Darren.
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:02.520]  Darren, are you with us?
[3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:03.520]  Yes, I'm here.
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:04.520]  How are you, buddy?
[3:28:04.520 --> 3:28:05.520]  Good, man.
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:06.520]  How are you doing?
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:07.520]  All right.
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:10.640]  You know, I hear everybody talking about the World Trade Towers, and no one seems to
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:17.640]  even touch upon the fact that the engines, when they smashed into the Pentagon, they
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:24.120]  had to change 90 degrees, travel some feet, and then fit into a 40-foot hole.
[3:28:24.120 --> 3:28:28.360]  Now, what's the distance between the two engines?
[3:28:28.360 --> 3:28:31.000]  I'm not quite sure what the distance of the two engines are.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:35.920]  I know you're talking about a plane with a wingspan of almost 120 feet in a hole that
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:37.200]  I wouldn't even say was 40 feet.
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:42.520]  I would say 16, 20 feet tops with visible damage, maybe 70 feet across.
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:46.520]  But in order for the wings to penetrate that visible damage, you would think there would
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:49.400]  be a hole there when, in fact, there isn't a hole.
[3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:53.040]  And I think the biggest problem with that for me is the fact that there's no damage
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:57.760]  from the tail section whatsoever, and this is a huge vertical stabilizer on the back
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:28:58.760]  of this plane.
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:03.040]  And it's not on the lawn, and there's no markings from where it would have hit, so what happened
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:04.040]  to it?
[3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:05.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:10.320]  And the engines themselves, they're what, each of them are five tons?
[3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:12.720]  I believe they're over a ton of titanium.
[3:29:12.720 --> 3:29:15.920]  I don't think they're five tons each, but they're almost indestructible.
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:19.600]  We cover that in length in a loose change, second edition.
[3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:22.720]  Graham, hold over so I can keep you on the other side.
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:36.120]  This is the Alex Jones show, infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[3:29:36.120 --> 3:29:39.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:46.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:37.640]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:40.080]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[3:30:56.520 --> 3:30:59.000]  destroys the official fable forever.
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:03.280]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[3:31:03.280 --> 3:31:08.080]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:09.960]  crime are brought to justice.
[3:31:09.960 --> 3:31:13.480]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[3:31:13.480 --> 3:31:17.920]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[3:31:17.920 --> 3:31:21.280]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:30.680]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on
[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:35.760]  films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[3:31:35.760 --> 3:31:36.760]  of other titles.
[3:31:36.760 --> 3:31:39.480]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[3:31:39.480 --> 3:31:44.120]  Truth is our weapon, and prismplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[3:31:44.120 --> 3:31:48.120]  to Big Brother.
[3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:52.440]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S., city, county,
[3:31:52.440 --> 3:31:55.520]  state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[3:31:55.520 --> 3:31:58.400]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[3:31:58.400 --> 3:32:02.480]  And corporate manipulation has caused green prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[3:32:02.480 --> 3:32:05.760]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[3:32:05.760 --> 3:32:08.960]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:12.880]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing,
[3:32:12.880 --> 3:32:14.200]  but it's headed this way.
[3:32:14.200 --> 3:32:18.000]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:21.920]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices,
[3:32:21.920 --> 3:32:22.920]  cheese, fruit, and more.
[3:32:22.920 --> 3:32:24.840]  We have tons of food in stock now.
[3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:32.880]  Call 1-800-753-1981, that's 1-800-753-1981, or go to beforeitstoolate.us, that's before
[3:32:32.880 --> 3:32:37.240]  itstoolate.us, where you'll find what you'll need to keep you and your loved one secure.
[3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:41.240]  And remember, those without food will be servants of those with the food.
[3:32:41.240 --> 3:33:10.240]  Call now.
[3:33:11.240 --> 3:33:21.520]  Man, I love Metallica.
[3:33:21.520 --> 3:33:26.280]  Even when they're covering stuff, Garage Day is Inc. is one hell of an album, folks.
[3:33:26.280 --> 3:33:31.440]  We're talking to Darren, and we're talking Pentagon, and you know, we're talking about
[3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:36.000]  what hit the Pentagon, but I think it's really just as important as why was the Pentagon
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  even hit.
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:39.960]  I mean, this is the most secure building in probably the world.
[3:33:39.960 --> 3:33:44.520]  This is the head of our military industrial complex right here, and I just posted over
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:51.800]  in my blog, LooseChange911.com, Norman Mineta's account of what happened in that PEOC, the
[3:33:51.800 --> 3:33:56.120]  Presidential Emergency Operating Center, which he wasn't even aware of until 9-11 when
[3:33:56.120 --> 3:33:57.760]  they took him down into it.
[3:33:57.760 --> 3:34:01.400]  And on five separate occasions, I have all five videos up there.
[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:07.320]  He confirms that Cheney is in that bunker prior to 9-11 that somebody is coming to him
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:10.760]  saying, sir, the plane is 50 miles out, sir, the plane is 30 miles out, sir, the plane
[3:34:10.760 --> 3:34:14.000]  is 10 miles out, do the orders still stand?
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:15.800]  And he says, of course they still stand.
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:17.680]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:20.640]  And they didn't even warn the people in that wing of the Pentagon.
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:21.640]  Sure.
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:26.320]  Most of them had been evacuated because it was where there was a bunch of work being
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:32.240]  done, but we still lost over 120 people in that building, and did those people deserve
[3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:33.240]  to die?
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:34.240]  No.
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:35.240]  They deserve to be warned.
[3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:37.160]  And then Cheney allowed this to happen.
[3:34:37.160 --> 3:34:41.520]  The 9-11 Commission whitewashed the entire situation by saying that Cheney wasn't in
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:45.000]  that bunker until almost 10 o'clock, well after the Pentagon strike.
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:46.480]  And then there's no more questions asked.
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:51.680]  It's okay, because Cheney and Bush testified together, not under oath in front of the 9-11
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:34:55.040]  Commission, with no record whatsoever of what they said.
[3:34:55.040 --> 3:35:02.320]  No transcript, no tape, no verbal confirmation, and no commissioners talking about what they
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:03.320]  actually said.
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:06.320]  Do you have any other points on the Pentagon, Darren?
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:07.320]  Well, no.
[3:35:07.320 --> 3:35:13.000]  I was just talking about the engines and the instantaneous acceleration that those engines
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:18.560]  had to go through to change direction and squeeze into that tight, neat little hole
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:23.520]  that they called an airliner, which is an absolute ridiculous assumption.
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:26.400]  Well, I'm with you, and I thank you for the call.
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:27.400]  I'm great to say.
[3:35:27.400 --> 3:35:28.400]  All right.
[3:35:28.400 --> 3:35:29.400]  Yep.
[3:35:29.400 --> 3:35:30.400]  Let's keep shooting through these callers.
[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:31.400]  Let's go to Craig in New Jersey.
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:32.400]  Craig, are you with me?
[3:35:32.400 --> 3:35:33.400]  No, I'm with somebody.
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:36.360]  You know, I did a few years in the Navy, and here's the thing that bothers me the most
[3:35:36.360 --> 3:35:37.760]  about 9-11.
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:40.400]  No one's head rolled.
[3:35:40.400 --> 3:35:41.760]  That's number one.
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:47.160]  And number two, are they really trying to insult our intelligence by telling us that
[3:35:47.160 --> 3:35:53.680]  not a single jet fighter in the area could have been dispatched with the exception from
[3:35:53.680 --> 3:35:54.680]  Boston?
[3:35:54.680 --> 3:35:56.200]  Dude, let me tell you something.
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:36:06.120]  OCEAN and Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia, for example, in 2001 was the air station fighter
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:07.120]  wing on the East Coast.
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:12.480]  So you're trying to tell me they couldn't find one at 14 Tomcat, which could have been
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:16.320]  basically armed and ready to roll in 10 minutes.
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:19.000]  I mean, it's things like that that really bothers me.
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:23.520]  Well, what really bothers me is the fact that we also have these simultaneous drills going
[3:36:23.520 --> 3:36:28.360]  on so that fighter jets are put halfway across the country in the wrong direction, and then
[3:36:28.360 --> 3:36:29.880]  some of them aren't even armed.
[3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:30.880]  Well, exactly.
[3:36:30.880 --> 3:36:32.120]  I mean, look for this way, too.
[3:36:32.120 --> 3:36:34.880]  You have Naval Air Station World Grove in Pennsylvania.
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:39.760]  You could have dispatched a dog on A-10 Warthog that flies like 300 miles an hour to intercept
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:41.960]  that jet for crying out loud.
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:46.200]  Well, with you being in the military, I'd be interested to get your take on the other
[3:36:46.200 --> 3:36:49.280]  white plane that was in New York City on the morning of 9-11.
[3:36:49.280 --> 3:36:54.400]  Now, a lot of people know about the white E-4B that was present on the scene of the Pentagon
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:36:56.520]  Strike, and that was part of the Global Guardian drill.
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:36:57.720]  They had five of those in the air.
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:36:58.720]  Oh, yeah, the Doomsday plane.
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:00.360]  Yeah, the Doomsday plane, sure.
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:05.880]  But if you look at the videos, you've got to type in World Trade Center, first plane,
[3:37:05.880 --> 3:37:08.040]  and then a camera planted or something like that.
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:12.440]  You can actually see before the second plane strikes that there is another white plane
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:17.000]  in restricted airspace prior to the second strike happening, and this looks a little different
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  from an E-4B.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:25.680]  It has a white body, it has two blue wings and a blue marking on the tail section, and
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:28.400]  this plane is also on the scene of the second crash.
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:32.560]  And then it flies away, but according to the official version, there's no military planes
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:33.560]  in the air that day.
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:36.040]  Well, that's just a lot of hooey.
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:42.640]  And besides that, my friend, there's also redundancy built into the combat readiness
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:43.640]  of the East Coast.
[3:37:43.640 --> 3:37:46.600]  If the Pentagon gets knocked out, which it was, guess what?
[3:37:46.600 --> 3:37:53.440]  You have the backup at the fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, which basically replicates
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:56.120]  the Naval Command Center that's in the Pentagon.
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:37:57.960]  So there's redundancy built into there.
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:01.680]  And meanwhile, they're running these drills at a Cheyenne mountain, and I've got the audio
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:03.920]  tapes of NORAD by them.
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:10.560]  Yeah, after Flight 93 has went down, they're calling up Cheyenne Mountain and saying, hey,
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:11.560]  stop the inputs.
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:13.680]  We can't tell what the real attacks are.
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:14.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:18.760]  And finally, my friend, let's put it this way, if they're trying to tell us what the
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:23.000]  best picture they could get on the Pentagon or something hitting it was that pinhole
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  camera.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:25.640]  I don't know if you've ever been to the Pentagon.
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:29.640]  You can't step on the ground without a camera taking your picture.
[3:38:29.640 --> 3:38:32.560]  You can't scratch your nose without somebody seeing it.
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:33.560]  They got thermal.
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:34.560]  They got black and white.
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:35.560]  They got color.
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:36.560]  They got ground sensors.
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:40.120]  They got feet on the ground going around in there, too.
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:43.520]  Every square inch of the building is covered, but that's the only picture they could come
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:44.520]  up with.
[3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:45.520]  I'm with you.
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:47.320]  Thank you so much for the call, Craig.
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:49.640]  Let's move on to a Mark in Georgia.
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:50.640]  Mark, you're live on the air.
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:51.640]  Hey, bro.
[3:38:51.640 --> 3:38:52.640]  How you doing, man?
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:53.640]  It's been a while.
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:39:02.040]  Listen, the one thing I remember, back in the 90s, Dr. Paul Martin gave a presentation
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:05.040]  at a cult awareness conference.
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:08.840]  He was explaining these are the tactics of manipulation in mind control.
[3:39:08.840 --> 3:39:13.160]  By the way, brainwashing is specific to people that are held against their will.
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:17.400]  I know that's perhaps a minor technicality.
[3:39:17.400 --> 3:39:20.560]  I'm pulling over here so you can hear me more clearly.
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:27.040]  The thing is, what he explained is that one of the major tactics is called loaded a language.
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:34.160]  That is to say, a term or phrase that has a strong emotional charge attached to it that
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:36.480]  obstructs people from thinking.
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:38.280]  You mean like conspiracy theorist?
[3:39:38.280 --> 3:39:41.000]  No, that's one of the major ones.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:46.600]  The other one, and I tried at the Georgia State GOP convention, I tried to go on record
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:50.160]  about this, and people were blue.
[3:39:50.160 --> 3:39:52.480]  The other one is the word terrorist.
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:57.440]  It's not like these people are human beings with God-given rights who have been provoked
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:02.840]  to fight against this, using whatever means are at their disposal, but they're not following
[3:40:02.840 --> 3:40:10.160]  the Geneva Convention in terms of having like some kind of marking that can be seen from
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:11.160]  a distance.
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:14.040]  Kind of like the French maquis during the Nazi occupation of France.
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.120]  It's like, they're not wearing something that says, hey, I'm the maquis, come shoot
[3:40:18.120 --> 3:40:19.120]  me.
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:24.280]  It's like they're resisting as they can, and the thing is that we call them terrorists
[3:40:24.280 --> 3:40:30.640]  to avoid dealing with the moral implications of if somebody else tried to do to us what
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:35.920]  we've been doing to them, people would stand up and fight against them.
[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:40.280]  That's one thing I really respect about Dr. Ron Paul is the only one who's applied the
[3:40:40.280 --> 3:40:43.200]  golden rule of, what if the rules were reversed?
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:49.080]  What if somebody else tried to do to us what we've been doing, would that be morally acceptable?
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:54.200]  And what I'm saying, it concerns me because it's like good cop, bad cop.
[3:40:54.200 --> 3:41:00.480]  Sometimes if you can explain to people, this is the tactic by which you're being manipulated,
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:05.360]  the trick is to re-engage people's critical thinking skills, and to help them realize
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:08.680]  that, no, we're not saying that everyone in the government is party to this.
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:13.680]  We're saying components high up in the government, and their cronies, and their lackeys, and
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:17.560]  their dupes, and their people who were compartmentalized.
[3:41:17.560 --> 3:41:24.880]  And that's the thing is that, it's like the first Thessalonians 521, test everything and
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:30.080]  hold back to that which is good or true, and it's good to know what's true even when the
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:31.080]  truth is not good.
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:37.880]  When I try to explain that to some people who profess to be Christians, because it's
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:42.440]  like, when you have this arrogant attitude of, well, there's one standard for us and
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:47.560]  a different standard for them, you know, you people need to snap out of it.
[3:41:47.560 --> 3:41:48.560]  Yeah.
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:49.720]  Well, Mark, it's all about dehumanization.
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:55.320]  It's about labeling them as terrorists as non-humans, so when we bomb their entire village and
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:41:59.800]  we kill civilians, children, women, it's okay because we hit a terrorist base.
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:05.080]  It's just like when Clinton went in with Cruz Missile Strikes against the Sudan, he said
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:06.840]  he was going after bin Laden.
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:13.680]  In reality, they bomb the largest aspirin factory in that country, and it doesn't really
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:16.960]  mesh with the American people because they were told that they were bombing terrorists.
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:18.600]  I thank you for the call.
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:19.600]  It's right.
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:23.400]  I mean, it's a different set of rules for a different set of folks, and because they
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:26.360]  tell you it's a terrorist, they're not a human being to you.
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:31.920]  It doesn't even click that this is somebody's brother, sister, mother, family member.
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:35.280]  You know, this is somebody that has the same emotions as you and I.
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:36.280]  They're human beings.
[3:42:36.280 --> 3:42:39.040]  All right, let's go to Steve in Texas.
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:40.040]  Steve, are you with us?
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:41.040]  Yes, sir.
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:42.040]  Good afternoon, Jason.
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:44.640]  I appreciate the work you've done with Loose Change.
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:51.400]  I've pointed a lot of people to that, and, you know, our item is the definitive documentary
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:56.240]  about 9-11, and, you know, just go look at that and check out the evidence versus the
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:42:59.560]  official story, and you draw your own conclusion based on that.
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:04.280]  Of course, if you're objective, you're going to draw the right conclusion, so I appreciate
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:05.880]  what you guys are doing with that.
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:09.040]  I just want to make people aware of some.
[3:43:09.040 --> 3:43:14.920]  I've already been in touch with Alex's producer about that, and this is going to, I think,
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:19.480]  turn out to be one of his biggest interviews ever, but there's a guy, I don't know if
[3:43:19.480 --> 3:43:21.360]  you've heard of him, named Scott Loper.
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:22.360]  No, I haven't.
[3:43:22.360 --> 3:43:23.360]  Okay.
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:26.360]  Yeah, you've heard of Restore the Republic, Aaron Russo's.
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:27.360]  Sure, sure.
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:28.360]  I've worked with him for a little bit.
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:34.080]  Yeah, they had a conference call last week, and what this was was Scott Loper and his
[3:43:34.080 --> 3:43:41.200]  lawyer on this call telling his very sad story, and what he shared is a real travesty
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:42.200]  of justice.
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:46.960]  Just in a nutshell, he'll get to share more when he's actually on, but he was up in Canada
[3:43:46.960 --> 3:43:49.200]  living there, married a Canadian woman.
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:53.880]  He's an American citizen, he was a police officer from New Jersey, moved up there in
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:54.880]  Ontario, Canada.
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:01.080]  Anyway, he ended up doing a private investigation of his own for the drugs and the prostitution
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:02.960]  that the police there were running.
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:08.280]  Well, they came down on him, and he uses the term arrested, but really what they did was
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:13.520]  abducted him as well as his wife and his daughter, and the bottom line is he has not
[3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:17.280]  seen his three-year-old son since 2000 when this took place.
[3:44:17.280 --> 3:44:24.160]  They kept him against his will for four years in solitary confinement, and they tortured
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:29.600]  him, and he goes into detail about this, but I mean what they did to him is horrendous,
[3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:34.640]  but the worst thing is when they finally released him four years later in 2004, they
[3:44:34.640 --> 3:44:38.960]  dumped him on the American side of the border in my hometown of Buffalo, New York, with
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:40.880]  just the clothes on his back.
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:45.600]  He got back to New Jersey, contacted his congressman, they got him in touch with the State Department.
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:46.600]  Here's the bottom line.
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:51.360]  This year, you probably heard, there's this guy, Medellin, that's an illegal Mexican,
[3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:55.760]  and in 1993 was convicted for the brutal rape and murder of two women here in the Houston
[3:44:55.760 --> 3:44:56.760]  area.
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:01.720]  This just came out stopping the execution of this guy who was in death while citing
[3:45:01.720 --> 3:45:07.080]  the Vienna Convention because he didn't get to contact the Mexican conflict, and yet here,
[3:45:07.080 --> 3:45:12.720]  the State Department has given absolutely no help to this man who's a legal citizen
[3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:16.920]  and has done nothing wrong, and they're basically telling him, forget about your son, he's
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:22.320]  probably dead, and so they've turned a blind eye, and the bigger picture of this, as far
[3:45:22.320 --> 3:45:27.200]  as Restore the Republic, is the North American Union, as well as people traveling out of
[3:45:27.200 --> 3:45:32.360]  the country from America, and so I'm hoping people will go out of world net daily.
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:36.600]  There's actually four, eight articles about this, and he's got documentation to back
[3:45:36.600 --> 3:45:40.800]  all this up, but they're saying there's not even a record of this man in Canada, which
[3:45:40.800 --> 3:45:45.560]  is a total lie, and our government knows about this, and I'm really upset about it.
[3:45:45.560 --> 3:45:46.920]  All right, Steve, well, we'll check it out.
[3:45:46.920 --> 3:45:48.040]  I hope they do get them on.
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:50.560]  That is an incredible story, and check them out.
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:53.640]  World Net Daily is a source I use in some of my films.
[3:45:53.640 --> 3:45:55.640]  It's one of the better websites out there.
[3:45:55.640 --> 3:45:56.640]  I thank you for the call, Steve.
[3:45:56.640 --> 3:45:58.920]  All right, let's go to Graham in Seattle.
[3:45:58.920 --> 3:45:59.920]  Graham, are you with us?
[3:45:59.920 --> 3:46:00.920]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[3:46:00.920 --> 3:46:07.040]  I was going to tell you, you were talking about the mural that was painted on the side
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:14.920]  of the flatbed truck with depicting the remote-controlled airplane flying into the New York City, and
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:19.560]  I found there was actually an article that Steve Watson had written last year, April
[3:46:19.560 --> 3:46:20.560]  23, 2007.
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:27.360]  It's called The Mystery of the 9-11 Car Bombs, and he references Channel 30 NYC, one
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:32.480]  of the emergency communications channels on the morning of September 11, where the first
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:37.960]  responder actually directly makes reference to a message about the remote-controlled plane,
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:41.640]  and he talks about how there's a big truck with a mural painted of an airplane diving
[3:46:41.640 --> 3:46:49.200]  into New York City and exploding, and then they were calling for the bomb people to come
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:50.200]  over there.
[3:46:50.200 --> 3:46:53.200]  So that was pretty interesting, and then, of course, there's that.
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:55.320]  We played that audio on the show yesterday, by the way.
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:46:56.800]  Did you play that audio?
[3:46:56.800 --> 3:46:57.800]  Yeah, you cannot.
[3:46:57.800 --> 3:47:02.160]  If you want to actually hear that audio, there's a great article over at truthalliance.net
[3:47:02.160 --> 3:47:09.600]  where somebody goes through that entire conversation, and on Google Maps, on Google Video, he kind
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:14.080]  of takes you where these things are happening, and that happened on King Street between 6th
[3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:15.680]  and 7th, and then there's a...
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:18.440]  Yeah, there's a 7th on King Street, yeah, it says that in this article that I'm looking
[3:47:18.440 --> 3:47:19.440]  at, too.
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:23.080]  It also has the audio on the Steve Watson article, and then you were talking to the
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:25.840]  weird-changed person earlier about the two...
[3:47:25.840 --> 3:47:29.880]  He had mentioned the Norman Manetta in the 2006 report.
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:35.400]  I think it was the Norman Manetta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:36.400]  study report.
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:37.400]  I believe so, too.
[3:47:37.400 --> 3:47:41.800]  It's a story of 2006 that referenced that, and it's kind of interesting that they found
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:46.240]  it to be just an innocent delivery truck, even though it had a painting of a plane flying
[3:47:46.240 --> 3:47:47.240]  into the world...
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:50.440]  And Middle Easterners who couldn't speak English that didn't own it.
[3:47:50.440 --> 3:47:55.320]  Yeah, and it's kind of interesting because the actual first responders reported that
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:47:56.320]  it exploded.
[3:47:56.320 --> 3:47:57.320]  Well, one of the things...
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:47:58.600]  I don't know if that one exploded.
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:02.640]  I think that they're talking about another van, because I'm listening to these things
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:05.840]  for the first time in the past couple days, and I've only listened to them about four
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:06.840]  or five times.
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:10.600]  But I do think that's a separate incident because they say that they have those guys
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:14.200]  in custody and that the flatbed truck had been pulled over, and then they're talking
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:19.200]  about this other explosion that may have been one of those urban moving systems vans.
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:20.200]  I got to jump in.
[3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:24.600]  I thank you for the call, Graham, and it's definitely an area of interest for me and
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:27.080]  one that really needs to be looked into.
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:29.320]  Let's go to Kenny in Wisconsin.
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:30.320]  Kenny, are you with us?
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:32.520]  Yeah, Jason, Trucker Kenny here.
[3:48:32.520 --> 3:48:34.280]  I want to ask you something.
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:39.640]  If you recall, I think a couple of years ago, there was an interview.
[3:48:39.640 --> 3:48:43.880]  I know the guy's first name is Rick, but I don't know his last name.
[3:48:43.880 --> 3:48:51.000]  He was interviewing Dr. Tagania Koreshnyov, Vladimir Putin's right-hand girl.
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:53.120]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:54.120]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:48:55.120]  Are you aware of that?
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:56.120]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:02.720]  Okay, well, going through an interpreter, Rick, and I wish I knew his last name, maybe
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:11.280]  one of the callers will remember, she indicated in the interview that 9-11 was two years,
[3:49:11.280 --> 3:49:17.600]  at least in the planning, and at the closing of the interview, she says that terrorists
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:23.240]  wear $2,000 Armani suits and ride around in limousines in Washington.
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:25.600]  I will leave it at that.
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:27.440]  Okay, thanks for taking my call, Jason.
[3:49:27.440 --> 3:49:30.760]  All right, thank you, Kenny, I'll look into it, but yeah, I mean, the real terrorists
[3:49:30.760 --> 3:49:34.480]  are the ones in the three-piece suits, and then they have their little drug runners and
[3:49:34.480 --> 3:49:35.480]  their little ops.
[3:49:35.480 --> 3:49:37.800]  I mean, look at Muhammad Adda.
[3:49:37.800 --> 3:49:43.600]  Never hurting for money, down in strip clubs, doing blow, drinking alcohol.
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:50.080]  This is the same guy that's on a plane with four other guys dressed in jumpsuits on a
[3:49:50.080 --> 3:49:53.880]  plane with James Woods, and James Woods is so spooked that they're going to actually
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:55.320]  hijack the aircraft.
[3:49:55.320 --> 3:50:00.320]  He pulls one of the stewardesses aside, he expresses his concerns, then watches them
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:04.680]  the entire time they're on the plane, then they both get off the plane, and they file
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:06.160]  separate FAA reports.
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.680]  Now, he's been on O'Reilly talking about this, this is prior to 9-11, the FAA does
[3:50:10.680 --> 3:50:11.680]  nothing.
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:12.680]  Why do they do nothing?
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:14.280]  Because they're told it's a drill.
[3:50:14.280 --> 3:50:19.040]  These guys work for the government, maybe not all of them, but you better know that
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:21.720]  Adda had all sorts of government ties.
[3:50:21.720 --> 3:50:26.240]  And at Maxwell Air Force Base, folks, there's no debating it, we have the FAA request.
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:30.120]  Well, that's A Muhammad Adda, not THE Muhammad Adda.
[3:50:30.120 --> 3:50:33.160]  Give me a break, final segment on the other side, this is the Alex Jones Show, we'll be
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:47.440]  taking your calls, I am Jason Bermas.
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:51.200]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[3:50:51.200 --> 3:50:53.760]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[3:50:53.760 --> 3:50:57.800]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and
[3:50:57.800 --> 3:50:59.480]  our high stress lifestyles.
[3:50:59.480 --> 3:51:03.600]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[3:51:03.600 --> 3:51:08.120]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[3:51:08.120 --> 3:51:09.120]  water.

[3:51:45.840 --> 3:51:47.800]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:51:47.800 --> 3:51:52.320]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[3:51:52.320 --> 3:51:53.840]  hour there is hope.

[3:51:56.920 --> 3:52:01.120]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[3:52:01.120 --> 3:52:02.640]  World Order master plan.
[3:52:02.640 --> 3:52:06.880]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:12.120]  that first hour where we had Alex and Jim Tucker reporting from Chantilly, Virginia,
[3:54:12.120 --> 3:54:18.160]  the Bilderberg Conference, where the mainstream media dare not go but to attend to cover up,
[3:54:18.160 --> 3:54:20.840]  to help manipulate. That's all they're doing there. They're not going to actually cover
[3:54:20.840 --> 3:54:27.000]  this event. You need to tune into the stream over at infowars.com. They'll be refeeding
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:32.360]  this right after the broadcast. All right, I've got four more callers on the line. Let's
[3:54:32.360 --> 3:54:35.960]  shoot through those callers. Let's try to get them all in. Let's go to Leo and Mass.
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:36.960]  Leo, are you with us?
[3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:40.600]  Yeah, Chris, pick off. Off the air.
[3:54:40.600 --> 3:54:41.600]  Off the air?
[3:54:41.600 --> 3:54:42.600]  Yeah.
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:47.040]  You can hold, and I can talk to you off there after the broadcast. So you want to do that?
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:52.000]  Hold him. All right. Let's go to Wilson in Texas. Wilson, are you with us?
[3:54:52.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  Yes.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:54.640]  What can I do for you today, sir?
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:55:00.320]  Jason, three or four things, man. Used to be able to get to Final Cut through Laughing
[3:55:00.320 --> 3:55:03.760]  Pawn.com. That's shut down, right?
[3:55:03.760 --> 3:55:08.280]  I don't know. I have no idea about the Laughing Pawn.com. I think I've seen it posted. But
[3:55:08.280 --> 3:55:13.480]  if you go to video.google.com, you type in loose change, Final Cut. You should be able
[3:55:13.480 --> 3:55:17.480]  to find it. Or you can just type in loose change into Google. The first thing that'll
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:21.640]  come up is the second edition, the one that I've posted. And then if you just go into
[3:55:21.640 --> 3:55:26.160]  more from user section, which is right next to the video, you can easily navigate to loose
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:27.160]  change, Final Cut.
[3:55:27.160 --> 3:55:28.160]  Cool.
[3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:32.480]  The Laughing Pawn used to be a free link to it. I think somebody else, maybe you didn't
[3:55:32.480 --> 3:55:36.760]  even know about enemies that have shut it down. But another one of the points that I
[3:55:36.760 --> 3:55:43.440]  wanted to make in Midwest City, Oklahoma City suburb, they just had a warrantless traffic
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:49.720]  search on Monday. And all of the people that were interviewed from Channel 4 were talking
[3:55:49.720 --> 3:55:51.240]  about, oh, well, this is a good thing.
[3:55:51.240 --> 3:55:55.320]  Well, it's great that we don't have a Fourth Amendment and they can just pull you over and
[3:55:55.320 --> 3:55:58.680]  say, oh, it looks like you don't have your seatbelt on. Or, oh, is there contraband in
[3:55:58.680 --> 3:56:02.240]  your car? Can we search your car? Yeah, it's the end of America, man.
[3:56:02.240 --> 3:56:07.440]  Exactly. But I have a clip of that. I sent Aaron at InfoWars and I haven't heard anybody
[3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:08.440]  talk about that yet.
[3:56:08.440 --> 3:56:12.880]  You know why? It's probably just because Aaron has been running around like crazy, got like
[3:56:12.880 --> 3:56:17.560]  five different jobs just to get this Bilderberg meeting. Anybody who's sending in stories right
[3:56:17.560 --> 3:56:20.560]  now, I just want to let you know, these guys are going to be gone for the entire week and
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:24.760]  I would try again on the Monday rounds. I thank you for the call, Wilson. I got to jump. Let's
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:28.200]  go to Tony in Illinois. Tony, are you with us?
[3:56:28.200 --> 3:56:34.920]  Yeah, Jason, not a lot of time left. Getting back to the Pentagon, the telephone poles,
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:40.400]  the most peculiar thing. How does five telephone poles get knocked down on that highway if
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:42.880]  it wasn't a large jet bus that I'm down?
[3:56:42.880 --> 3:56:47.400]  Well, this is my big problem with the telephone poles. If it was a large jet that cut through
[3:56:47.400 --> 3:56:50.320]  that, I do think you have to account for the telephone poles.
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:56:57.120]  Where are the pieces of wing that would have shattered? I mean, you're going through five
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:57:01.960]  separate ones, some of which were cut in half. They weren't just knocked over. Now, normally
[3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:06.720]  when a plane hits something like that, it's very obstructed. You would have thought that
[3:57:06.720 --> 3:57:12.240]  the plane would have hit the lawn of the Pentagon, crashed into the ground, lost control. We're
[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:17.200]  talking about 500 plus miles an hour, less than 40 feet off the ground to clip those
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:21.680]  poles and then land perfectly into the Pentagon. I don't know what happened with those poles.
[3:57:21.680 --> 3:57:26.760]  We do have to account for that damage. I've always stated that my best guess is that this
[3:57:26.760 --> 3:57:31.040]  was some kind of a remote controlled drone that was made out of a separate material than
[3:57:31.040 --> 3:57:35.600]  your standard plane that was able to resist or just go fast enough where it was able to
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:39.680]  cut through those. I don't have an answer for you, man. I mean, again, loose change,
[3:57:39.680 --> 3:57:44.080]  final cut tries to handle all the angles. I'm sorry, we can't go to Art in Kansas. We
[3:57:44.080 --> 3:57:52.640]  just took the last caller. Guys, the retransmission starts in less than 60 seconds over at infowars.com.
[3:57:52.640 --> 3:57:56.360]  I am Jason Bermas. I'll be in tomorrow and the next day. We're going to have more from

[3:58:36.480 --> 3:58:44.320]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[3:58:44.320 --> 3:58:51.240]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Is that their objective being world domination?
[3:58:51.240 --> 3:58:56.640]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world
[3:58:56.640 --> 3:59:05.480]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[3:59:05.480 --> 3:59:11.200]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:15.720]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Bilderberg is making great progress toward
[3:59:15.720 --> 3:59:18.920]  a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the
[3:59:18.920 --> 3:59:23.840]  money they need. They're after power. That's their after-missing. Order in-game on DVD at
