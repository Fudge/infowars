[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.080]  now but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.200]  needed his peers challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a
[00:31.200 --> 00:39.280]  semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to see that look at
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.200]  these little globalist pimps these preening sycophantic nobodies who
[00:45.200 --> 00:50.240]  haven't had an audience worth mentioning in years
[00:50.240 --> 00:58.920]  imploding sinking into the bygone swamp like so many other extinct creatures
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.520]  that have been upon the face of this globe they are not liberals and they are
[01:04.520 --> 01:08.880]  not the future they are the opposite of Renaissance they are the plague and
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.120]  Pierce Morgan ladies and gentlemen for all intents and purposes has not had a
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.280]  show in about a year and Larry King left that had about a million and a half to
[01:17.280 --> 01:22.760]  two million viewers a night in the US here's Morgan some nights had 350,000
[01:22.760 --> 01:28.260]  viewers that was on a low-end high-end half a mill when I was on a show he had
[01:28.260 --> 01:31.680]  two million viewers that night two and a half million the next night two million
[01:31.680 --> 01:34.640]  the next night a million and a half the next night a million a million and then
[01:34.640 --> 01:40.120]  down to 500,000 what you saw him getting a ratings boost for a week or so was an
[01:40.120 --> 01:48.880]  explosion an explosion like when a car blows up in the in a military operation
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.600]  when a truck's coming down the road and a 50 cal with tracers opens up on its
[01:52.600 --> 01:56.920]  engine and hits the fuel tanks and the truck blows up it's not winning when it
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.080]  blows up throwing troops out of the back on fire an engine parts flying into the
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.000]  driver's face killing them it's exploding it's burning you can also liken it to a
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.400]  dead cat bounce there's Morgan fell and he bounced and they've got all these
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.400]  sniveling establishment media articles going a lot of people want to take
[02:16.400 --> 02:22.080]  credit for taking him down chief amongst them Alex Jones well there are
[02:22.080 --> 02:25.480]  hundreds of articles out today I went and looked at some of them hundreds of
[02:25.480 --> 02:30.480]  them listed saying that I am the main culprit which I'm proud of but listen I
[02:30.480 --> 02:34.320]  don't want to take credit where credit isn't due I am not responsible for the
[02:34.320 --> 02:42.600]  decline and fall of Pierce Morgan who never even rose mainstream dinosaur
[02:42.600 --> 02:49.080]  media is dying and that's why Pierce Morgan has no audience and none of their
[02:49.080 --> 02:52.240]  shows have any audience and they're not going to have any audience I don't care
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.200]  how many movie stars they parade on there people want Veritas they want

[10:20.440 --> 10:23.400]  should blow the whole earth up just to stop there being a cloud that looks like
[10:23.400 --> 10:26.920]  Hitler in the sky I think it's great they're teaching two plus two equals five
[10:26.920 --> 10:33.760]  in school I love Common Core because everything is awesome everything is
[10:33.760 --> 10:38.080]  cool when you're part of a cult I mean a government worshipping group the truth
[10:38.080 --> 10:42.800]  is though almost no one is buying into the system now and the approval rating
[10:42.800 --> 10:48.400]  of the establishment is plunging and we're at that Rubicon crossroads right
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.040]  now where the dinosaur mainstream state-run media offshore banker run
[10:53.040 --> 10:58.400]  media George Soros controlled media is teetering on the edge of total collapse
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.880]  it's been collapsing for a long time but now the public knows it's sinking
[11:02.880 --> 11:11.280]  beneath the waves and the average show on MSNBC or CNN has less viewers than a
[11:11.280 --> 11:18.120]  weekday radio show or a morning radio show in a major city I happen to you
[11:18.120 --> 11:21.720]  know get the ratings and see the ratings from different cities were on the radio
[11:21.720 --> 11:27.560]  in and I can look at morning shows say in Austin Texas that have upwards of 80
[11:27.560 --> 11:33.240]  to 100,000 people listening every 15 minutes tuning in and out and over a
[11:33.240 --> 11:38.120]  three-hour period could have 200 300,000 listeners
[11:38.120 --> 11:44.400]  Piers Morgan on a bad night had 350,000 on a good night had half a million so
[11:44.400 --> 11:50.520]  this is nationwide worldwide less than half a million viewers this is
[11:50.520 --> 11:58.120]  literally a hoax this is literally a fraud and it's turned out that CNN MSNBC
[11:58.120 --> 12:03.080]  have been caught that guys print this in rigged ratings with Nielsen on cable
[12:03.080 --> 12:06.760]  just type in Nielsen caught faking cable ratings to try to beat Fox viewers
[12:06.760 --> 12:10.480]  ago Fox actually does have three or four million viewers on average still not
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.520]  that big of a deal but that's like Mount Everest compared to a hill in ratings
[12:15.520 --> 12:21.320]  when you talk about MSNBC or something like CNN and by the way Dylan
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.000]  Radigan on MSNBC had the highest ratings on the channel because he would attack
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.800]  both parties and talk about a foreign banking takeover and how we're being
[12:28.800 --> 12:34.000]  looted and yell and scream and it wasn't fake he was he was allowing himself to
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.840]  get angry but it was real real passion and so they didn't renew his contract
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.640]  because he had high ratings it's the same thing with what I'd call more of a
[12:43.640 --> 12:49.920]  real liberal somebody like Donahue who had four million viewers when they
[12:49.920 --> 12:55.680]  axed him in MSNBC a night same thing with Ventura Ventura had almost four
[12:55.680 --> 13:01.360]  million viewers number two show on MSNBC and but he wasn't partisan he was
[13:01.360 --> 13:06.440]  really libertarian so they gave him golden handcuffs and paid him off three
[13:06.440 --> 13:13.280]  and a half million dollars a year of his four-year contract and they came to him
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.240]  and they said stop bashing the Democrats and stop bashing the Republicans and
[13:17.240 --> 13:20.440]  stop bashing the war because the war was getting started then and he wouldn't
[13:20.440 --> 13:23.920]  shut up so they said fine we're gonna pay your contract out but you can't do
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.520]  media for the rest of the four years of your contract that's how this works
[13:29.520 --> 13:35.000]  ladies and gentlemen and again I don't want to be on CNN if I was offered the
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.320]  CNN Piers Morgan slot I would only do it because it would be a giant stunt when
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.480]  I wouldn't compromise and would get huge ratings I'm telling you I would have
[13:45.480 --> 13:54.040]  15 million viewers guaranteed a night huge phenomenon within two months the
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.520]  first night I premiered I would have two million I bet my life on it and the
[13:58.520 --> 14:05.560]  executives at CNN Time Warner Comcast you know they know that they all know
[14:05.560 --> 14:11.680]  that they all understand that they know what sells I've met with the heads of
[14:11.680 --> 14:23.560]  BBC true TV travel channel A&E history channel discovery channel and they point
[14:23.560 --> 14:26.920]  blank go no we know this is like six seven years ago that gun shows would take
[14:26.920 --> 14:30.920]  over they finally bit on it limited not with me and those are big hits they go
[14:30.920 --> 14:35.040]  we know redneck stuff is popular in their words we know pro-christian stuff is
[14:35.040 --> 14:41.000]  popular and I told all these executives this ten years ago I told all these
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.800]  executives this seven years ago five years ago three years ago and look at
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.360]  the Bible on cable 15 million viewers their other hit show two million a hit
[14:50.360 --> 14:56.080]  shows two million on cable look at Duck Dynasty 10 15 20 million viewers a show
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.760]  on A&E whose other hit shows have a million and by the way I was pitched on
[15:01.760 --> 15:06.240]  A&E four years ago and when I used to go to LA all the time have these worthless
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.720]  meetings in New York and they're like we want you to run around with hillbilly's
[15:09.720 --> 15:14.240]  hunting and chew tobacco and you know basically act like a fool and I said I'm
[15:14.240 --> 15:22.600]  not doing it the point is is that it is that they need us we don't need them
[15:22.600 --> 15:31.800]  ladies and gentlemen sci-fi channel pitched me a show every night live that would be in
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.000]  the studios here but they would come and have me do it in the studio in Austin and
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.600]  then I would have all these guests on the poem is I'd have to do Chewbacobras
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.200]  Bigfoot space aliens and then I could do what I wanted in between that that would
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.800]  just discredit it and I'm not knocking my buddy Joe Rogan he basically got that
[15:46.800 --> 15:52.120]  show and went and did it and good for Joe I mean it was like but I see these
[15:52.120 --> 15:57.160]  shows like I was I was offered by court TV that became true TV was gonna be
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.680]  called American conspiracy that's what Ventura called his book and then they
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.480]  went and pitched it four years later to Ventura and Ventura did it but a guy
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.120]  from the BBC an American programmer from the BBC there's even a trailer out
[16:10.120 --> 16:13.040]  there for it that we released called American conspiracy said I go ahead and
[16:13.040 --> 16:16.120]  release it on YouTube if that guy's YouTube that's like a minute long it's
[16:16.120 --> 16:21.040]  called American conspiracy with Alex Jones four years before Ventura's show
[16:21.040 --> 16:26.240]  conspiracy theory which was gonna be called American conspiracy and with
[16:26.240 --> 16:29.920]  Ventura they at least a lot enough real topics that I was part of the show was
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.560]  happening to be part of it and I'm not up here bragging I'm telling you how
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.600]  media works and giving you inside baseball I was offered Ventura show
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.960]  when he quit after the third season because he didn't like the topics yeah
[16:44.960 --> 16:48.600]  Ventura quit that would not do a fourth season he was offered a fourth season
[16:48.600 --> 16:51.840]  it was a hit show but you can see by the third season it was going off the deep
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.960]  end into humanities and you know Chewbacca brothers and vampires and crap
[16:55.960 --> 16:59.400]  and which is entertaining and fine and I'm not knocking that but I'm not gonna
[16:59.400 --> 17:03.200]  do it and Ventura is not gonna do it so let's just get this straight to the
[17:03.200 --> 17:07.080]  literal hundreds of news articles today and a bunch of them are like Alex Jones
[17:07.080 --> 17:11.680]  did hurt Pierce Morgan but he wishes he had a CNN show no I don't wish I had a
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.800]  CNN show I have a show with millions of viewers and listeners I get to reach
[17:16.800 --> 17:24.280]  out unfettered uncensored and talk to people you understand that I know for a
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.040]  fact people like because I've read about it in the news Matt Drudge has been
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.120]  offered all these TV shows and radio shows and doesn't do them because he
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.720]  understands the old media is a joke now and you're almost discredited even
[17:34.720 --> 17:38.880]  working with it or being around it you get the smell of it off on you we're on
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.920]  Roku we're on Boxy we're on all these different platforms and we're in the top
[17:42.920 --> 17:48.040]  number one number two number three or number four of every media platform out
[17:48.040 --> 17:51.960]  there in news and politics without promotion without me getting up here on
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.680]  air and plugging it without anything by osmosis we are dominating every free
[17:56.680 --> 18:02.680]  open platform and I don't even care about dominating except that I want to get
[18:02.680 --> 18:08.200]  the word out it's old hat man I've been on air 19 years I've already done this a
[18:08.200 --> 18:12.360]  lot for me it's all personal about liberty and freedom and about having a
[18:12.360 --> 18:18.200]  future for my children it is not about eating at fancy New York restaurants it
[18:18.200 --> 18:21.200]  is not about hanging out with celebrities it is not about kissing the
[18:21.200 --> 18:25.520]  butt of Pierce Morgan Pierce Morgan folks was a joke last year when I went on
[18:25.520 --> 18:29.160]  his show he'd already been on two years and he'd gone from two million viewers
[18:29.160 --> 18:34.000]  when Larry King passed off at the time to six hundred thousand it was 300
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.360]  something thousand he left eight folks that is the equivalent of not having a
[18:38.360 --> 18:43.520]  pulse and I told you I've been in CNN broadcast center many times before it
[18:43.520 --> 18:47.800]  was nice it was rotting when the light bulbs burned out with feces sprayed all
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.600]  over the walls in every bathroom I thought they put me in a gross bathroom
[18:50.600 --> 18:53.600]  on purpose and I'm not a neat freak either but I went down to the other
[18:53.600 --> 18:57.160]  bathroom and sort of check it they were dirty too and everybody looked
[18:57.160 --> 19:01.400]  disheveled with big circles around their eyes and beaten and I announced here on
[19:01.400 --> 19:05.520]  air CNN is dead and you notice they're leaving news now they're falling apart
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.080]  they're tanking across the board I told you last January 13 months ago CNN is
[19:11.080 --> 19:17.200]  dead did I lie to you no I didn't lie to you not everything is wonderful not
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.840]  everything is cool when you're part of a Jim Jones cult that follows talking
[19:20.840 --> 19:26.160]  points here's Morgan is an arrogant nobody and I went in there and called
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.840]  his bluff and said look you're a traitor trying to take this country over and
[19:29.840 --> 19:33.640]  disarm us and I'm calling you out scum don't insult me and claim you don't want
[19:33.640 --> 19:39.360]  to disarm us everywhere you people get control you take all the guns shut up
[19:39.800 --> 19:43.600]  you know what Paul Revere would have done was running through with a with a
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.520]  sword sword but that's because he's a radical I'm a radical for just yelling
[19:48.520 --> 19:52.000]  at him oh my gosh don't yell at him oh that's just crediting no that's how we

[24:20.280 --> 24:26.920]  probably in some face-saving event to have a monthly magazine show I predict
[24:26.920 --> 24:32.840]  on CNN that's now basically going to cooking shows and entertainment because
[24:32.840 --> 24:38.000]  people know that they have an agenda of fraud and deceit and anti-liberty
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.200]  everything that's pro-god pro-gun pro-family is exploding in value
[24:43.200 --> 24:49.640]  everything that's anti-god guns and guts and family is going down in value but
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.480]  it doesn't matter you've got the hijacked government with all the trendy
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.800]  followers who don't even get their news from news they get their news from the
[24:57.800 --> 25:03.040]  culture and that's the final domino to fall is the movies and the sitcoms and
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.600]  the dramas where Obama is now mainly focusing and Paul Watson's doing an
[25:07.600 --> 25:14.200]  article on that right now titled Obama is taking over late night television and
[25:14.200 --> 25:17.960]  that's where you've got all the pro-Obama stuff and the Obama visits and the
[25:17.960 --> 25:22.520]  shell Obama stuff they're targeting the young people the yuppies who literally
[25:22.520 --> 25:27.160]  don't even get their news from news because that's the process first they
[25:27.160 --> 25:31.400]  discredit news by taking it over in the last few decades and turning it into
[25:31.400 --> 25:34.920]  propaganda now that they're done with it we go right to White House press
[25:34.920 --> 25:38.960]  releases and right to propaganda and product placement and propaganda
[25:38.960 --> 25:43.560]  placement what they call behavior placement inside of the cartoons the
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.960]  movies the dramas so you turn on movies and the gun owners are child molesters
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.440]  you go watch a cartoon the bad guys are tri-quartered hat terrorists they're
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.760]  gonna blow up the dam and Green Lantern has to stop them you go turn on
[25:56.760 --> 26:03.200]  Breaking Bad and the method is a Ron Paul fan every single show has an anti-
[26:03.200 --> 26:08.360]  freedom bent until the last year suddenly those shows aren't doing as well
[26:08.360 --> 26:12.240]  the ones that have an anti-liberties bent and I'm seeing more of a freedom
[26:12.240 --> 26:18.040]  libertarian slant as they would call it so there's a real revolution of
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.400]  awakening especially in the intelligentsia the system may have 40% of
[26:22.400 --> 26:27.000]  the population totally ignorant totally dumb ready to buy anything they're told
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.960]  everything is awesome everything's cool when you're part of a team they want
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.560]  tripling and quadrupling of their Obamacare prices they love every screw
[26:35.560 --> 26:39.960]  job that comes along they think they're winners those people don't count because
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.720]  they're not intellectuals they're not part of society when you get into
[26:44.720 --> 26:50.040]  intellectual society left right center I don't care what it is people don't
[26:50.040 --> 26:54.720]  like the Republican leadership they don't like the Democratic leadership they
[26:54.720 --> 26:58.680]  don't like the establishment they don't I mean I'm talking about rich people
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.480]  folks don't like the stagnation and don't like this select corporations that
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.600]  are tax-exempt like Google and and and and Microsoft and General Electric and
[27:08.600 --> 27:12.760]  Warren Buffett and all the rest of them they really are starting to understand
[27:12.760 --> 27:17.360]  the message that isn't just rich and poor it's a nouveau rich and Renaissance
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.520]  and entrepreneurs and the working class in the middle class versus the insider
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.680]  technocrats who literally control the money machines and the issuance of
[27:26.680 --> 27:35.200]  money and the fact that whether it's MSNBC or CNN it doesn't matter or or
[27:35.200 --> 27:42.320]  Al Gore's current TV they are all in total ratings freefall so why do we get
[27:42.320 --> 27:49.040]  so excited when we're on their shows why is it so prestigious when the Wall
[27:49.040 --> 27:52.720]  Street Journal or the New York Times calls folks I've had the Wall Street
[27:52.720 --> 27:59.520]  Journal the New York Times call you name it and want to do profiles and I say
[27:59.520 --> 28:05.520]  no and they say we are the New York Times we are New Yorker magazine we are
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.040]  the on and on and on and I said even if you wrote a positive piece your editors
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.080]  won't let you publish it a B you don't matter anymore well even the New York
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.920]  Times editorial board came out and said we aren't relevant we aren't pertinent
[28:18.920 --> 28:24.120]  no one is listening to us we cannot cause any debate when I was in the New
[28:24.120 --> 28:27.200]  York Times for the first time like 18 years ago I was in a bunch of other
[28:27.200 --> 28:31.240]  times I would have NPR calls other channels going you were in the New York
[28:31.240 --> 28:36.920]  Times how does it feel to make it because to them and it wasn't even a big
[28:36.920 --> 28:42.400]  deal 15 years ago they just still thought it was a big deal and that's all
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.880]  it was good for to go on Fox and CNN was that affiliates would pick us up
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.320]  because oh we we'd arrived even though there weren't were big audiences there
[28:50.320 --> 28:55.200]  or sponsors would spend money with us and then get a result but they would
[28:55.200 --> 29:01.480]  trust us to make a big purchase just because they'd seen me on CNN but that
[29:01.480 --> 29:05.280]  was six seven eight nine ten years ago we did we literally like the space
[29:05.280 --> 29:09.760]  shuttle with its rocket boosters falling off we don't need you you're gone
[29:09.760 --> 29:16.240]  you're empty bye bye bye bye you're empty you're a joke now they're gonna
[29:16.240 --> 29:19.120]  counter strike I'm gonna talk about this when we come back from break against
[29:19.120 --> 29:21.640]  the real media the new media the independent media we ought to stick
[29:21.640 --> 29:25.560]  together the battle's far from one but we are winning this round and if we have
[29:25.560 --> 29:29.880]  the initiative get the eye of the tiger it really aggressive open a big can of
[29:29.880 --> 29:35.040]  whoop booty and just get in there and start attacking with the truth we're
[29:35.040 --> 29:37.360]  gonna beat them they're gonna hit the ground we're never gonna get back up
[29:37.360 --> 29:43.120]  we're real close to slitting their throat ear to ear and that tongue ain't
[29:43.120 --> 29:48.560]  gonna flap anymore once we pull it out stay with me we'll ride back

[33:24.160 --> 33:29.680]  domestic you know it's a cheesy song but it's only cheesy because you're
[33:29.680 --> 33:34.400]  embarrassed me turn it up in your car crank it up rising up that's what's
[33:34.400 --> 33:39.880]  happening not gonna stop the eye of the tiger identify the enemy commit to
[33:39.880 --> 33:59.760]  bringing them down never stop never surrender we're never giving our guns
[33:59.760 --> 34:04.680]  up we're taking our kids out of your public schools we're waking up in the
[34:04.680 --> 34:09.840]  new world order we're withdrawing our consent from the gmo mega agribusiness
[34:09.840 --> 34:15.280]  we're aware of the chemical weapons in the water we have the eye of the tiger
[34:15.280 --> 34:21.520]  the total commitment but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the
[34:21.520 --> 34:25.320]  only reason I think you needed his peers challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
[34:25.320 --> 34:30.040]  match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love
[34:30.040 --> 34:39.440]  to see that in uniform bottom line though they didn't want to win only the
[34:39.440 --> 34:43.440]  truth could set singing and free only covering real issues they'd have 15
[34:43.440 --> 34:47.400]  million viewers a night on pierce Morgan like the Bible series had it was
[34:47.400 --> 34:50.560]  wholesome and good they'd have 15 million viewers a night like duck
[34:50.560 --> 34:55.800]  dynasty if they were real people want what's real they don't want what's fake
[34:55.800 --> 34:59.560]  peers and by the way you speak of eye of the tiger you're the ones talking about
[34:59.560 --> 35:02.680]  how you want to kill me and then how pierce Morgan would dress up in a
[35:02.680 --> 35:07.000]  uniform to kill me and they've got the ambassadors tart daughter up there
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.720]  promoting all this you know I'm not kidding peers it would have saved your
[35:10.720 --> 35:15.840]  show if you'd have been man enough with you and Buzz Bissinger at the same time
[35:15.840 --> 35:20.040]  to take me on with gloves because you're a coward or bare knuckles in the ring I
[35:20.040 --> 35:24.800]  mean I'm not kidding you'd have 50 million viewers for something like that
[35:24.800 --> 35:29.480]  you could have pay per view and raise 50 million dollars for Haitian relief or
[35:29.480 --> 35:33.480]  whatever a dollar per viewer guaranteed you wiped that up for a month you'd
[35:33.480 --> 35:37.640]  have tens of millions of viewers literally but you don't understand it do
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.360]  you and I would have gotten that ring and stomped you in to the ground you and
[35:42.360 --> 35:45.880]  Buzz Bissinger who want to sit around talking about how you want to kill me
[35:45.880 --> 35:51.600]  with a gun that's right you want the guns you want to take the guns from us
[35:51.600 --> 35:55.520]  ladies and gentlemen so I stood up to the challenge I said oh you want to kill
[35:55.520 --> 35:59.480]  me how much you get in the ring and you never took the challenge did you
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.720]  peers we got was it a million signatures when it was finally done
[36:03.720 --> 36:09.960]  to deport your fat butt out of the US all we needed was 25,000 because again
[36:09.960 --> 36:12.720]  you don't have a First Amendment right to come here and call for my rights to
[36:12.720 --> 36:18.120]  be taken you don't like this country get out of it and that's what Jay Leno told
[36:18.120 --> 36:21.200]  you behind the scenes I was told by his head producer that Jay Leno went back
[36:21.200 --> 36:23.960]  on that episode where Jay Leno played clips to me and talked about it and
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.920]  said hey you know the problem is he said this on air too but he said he said
[36:27.920 --> 36:32.600]  listen you're not an American and people don't like you be an anti-gun on air so
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.200]  I suggest you back off of it if you want to be popular and of course he didn't
[36:37.200 --> 36:41.640]  he thought he could teach us a yanks a thing or two just like his ancestors did
[36:41.640 --> 36:47.120]  in 1776 and hey here's the deal you're the one that isn't standing anymore
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.480]  buddy boy I never had a big-time Warner AOL hundred billion dollar company to
[36:52.480 --> 36:58.520]  put me on air I never had all that type of stuff I had nothing I think my dad
[36:58.520 --> 37:02.320]  loaned me like $20,000 over the first year when I first did my access show and
[37:02.320 --> 37:08.240]  then luckily got a local radio show that's the reality here ladies and
[37:08.240 --> 37:12.440]  gentlemen of what has happened and what has unfolded and notice the media came
[37:12.440 --> 37:17.800]  out and said the pro-gun people are discredited Alex Jones has discredited
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.360]  us and they had the Democrats all saying that because if everybody started
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.840]  acting like me getting aggressive getting back in their face going I'm not
[37:24.840 --> 37:28.720]  having a debate with you this is my right it lowers crime to own guns you
[37:28.720 --> 37:32.680]  want victim disarmament stop acting like you don't want to take guns here's Diane
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.320]  Feinstein's quote everywhere you people are in control you take the general
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.560]  public's guns this is a mafia criminal takeover that the the the psychotropic
[37:41.560 --> 37:45.440]  drugs you promote on this show with your sponsors are what are connected to
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.080]  people in mass shootings why don't you admit that I'm calling you out if you
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.520]  want a civil war enemy you're gonna get one red coat don't make the mistakes
[37:54.520 --> 38:01.040]  your ancestors made straight talk folks straight talk it was absolute
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.000]  devastating victory to arrogantly speak in a British accent to him to
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.800]  arrogantly get back in his face nothing against British people to just be clear
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.560]  on that talking about Pierce Morgan who's loved in England to let him know
[38:14.560 --> 38:18.560]  that I could speak in the voice like this is well and become descending and
[38:18.560 --> 38:22.320]  they admitted to me when I saw him in Houston in his producer they said no
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.480]  we wanted you back on we understand record ratings but it's been decided that
[38:26.480 --> 38:29.880]  you shouldn't be given that much attention you mean the explosion it
[38:29.880 --> 38:34.720]  caused which makes me more powerful and hurts you you don't want to go in the
[38:34.720 --> 38:38.880]  ring in that explosion with me because I've got the Constitution Bill of Rights
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.720]  and common sense on my side I'm the Iron Man compared to you buddy and I'm
[38:43.720 --> 38:47.320]  ready to go in a room with a thousand pounds of TNT and have you push the
[38:47.320 --> 38:51.760]  plunger down but you crawled out of that explosion and we're actually dead on
[38:51.760 --> 38:55.000]  arrival and so you thought you'd have other people on to have fake debates
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.960]  with them and they cleaned your clock as well you kept looking for pro-gun
[38:58.960 --> 39:03.840]  people that you could beat and the truth is you lost on your own home turf the
[39:03.840 --> 39:08.640]  intellectual battle and now Pierce Morgan has had his show canceled but you
[39:08.640 --> 39:14.720]  canceled your show the day you decided to push anti-liberty unpopular
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.880]  agendas but see the big banks can print unlimited trillions so they don't care
[39:19.880 --> 39:23.360]  about the money but see there's a problem they don't have the ratings
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.200]  though and now the facade that they had ratings the facade that they were the
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.680]  big media the facade that they were in the 20-story buildings in downtown
[39:33.680 --> 39:38.520]  New York and 30-story buildings the facade that they were the audience and
[39:38.520 --> 39:46.760]  they were the market it's all over it's all over and when it's all said and done
[39:46.760 --> 39:51.560]  there's not gonna be a fox news to speak of because their audience is dying
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.760]  quite literally but it'll be the last standing it CNN MSNBC they're all gonna
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.400]  go to the way of the Dodo bird they're all gonna go the way the saber-tooth
[40:00.400 --> 40:04.040]  cats we're all gonna go the way the woolly mammoth and the mastodon and
[40:04.040 --> 40:09.520]  the brachiosaur and triceratops and megalodon the super shark you're all
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.760]  going the way and there might still be an occasional seal of cans caught off the
[40:13.760 --> 40:20.160]  coast of Madagaster but for all intents and purposes you are extinct stick a
[40:20.160 --> 40:29.120]  fork in your degenerate vampiric but because you are done you are over it's
[40:29.120 --> 40:33.560]  done every poll every metric every number six percent approval rating for
[40:33.560 --> 40:38.480]  Congress 19% approval rating for mainstream media on the high end 16 on
[40:38.480 --> 40:44.080]  the low end you're gone you're over you're dead and the last few liberal want
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.520]  to be well-meaning bleeding hearts that bought into your cosmology because they
[40:48.520 --> 40:52.120]  really do care they're going to wake up is they're betrayed very very quickly and
[40:52.120 --> 40:54.960]  the Republican leadership the things they're gonna block the Tea Party the
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.200]  libertarian revolution you're done to no amount of false flags no amount of
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.880]  stage terror no matter how big the war is this stuff doesn't work anymore the
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.520]  tricks don't work anymore it's like a heroin addict that shoot in a hundred
[41:09.520 --> 41:13.120]  times they were shooting ten years before and no matter how big the dose it
[41:13.120 --> 41:17.240]  just never as good as it was and soon you're just gonna OD on your false
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.840]  flags and your propaganda and your race baiting and your condescension and all
[41:21.840 --> 41:27.440]  of your garbage nothing can put Humpty Dumpty back together again and Piers
[41:27.440 --> 41:34.400]  Morgan never fell Piers Morgan never arrived he was a hoax from the beginning
[41:34.400 --> 41:40.120]  and I happen to know that the Time Warner programmers are fully aware that if
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.960]  they put someone like me on I would have two million viewers the first night I
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.240]  would have five million in two weeks ten million in three weeks fifteen million
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.400]  in a month it would go up to 20 million if they let me say what I wanted and have
[41:54.400 --> 42:02.000]  the guest on it would shake up the whole country and then and then what would
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.120]  they do well begin that would upset the entire Apple cart people are hungry for
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.560]  all of that they're hungry to get the country back they're hungry but see the
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.560]  establishment it isn't about ratings it's about the illusion that they are the
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.920]  establishment in their suits sitting back in an English accent that will
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.440]  impress the the country bumpkins and flyover country no it doesn't impress the
[42:26.440 --> 42:32.560]  country bumpkins and I called the hoax what it was a red-coaked snake hacking
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.560]  scandal fraudster who publishes fake photos and newspapers of troops
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.960]  urinating on people that's Piers Morgan I called him out as the fraud and the
[42:41.960 --> 42:46.600]  scamster he was and they had guys with their fishbow turning red threatening
[42:46.600 --> 42:50.560]  me in front of Rob do that I better get out or I would have trouble with their
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.000]  security people and I looked at all of them and laughed at them and I said I
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.120]  beat you and I said go ahead do something to me and see what happens I'll
[42:58.120 --> 43:05.040]  kick your asses right now I told CNN I will beat your ass I told their security
[43:05.040 --> 43:08.240]  people right there going out the door Rob do was there like go ahead tough
[43:08.240 --> 43:15.440]  guys bow your fist up get in my face do something you see you can't win I'm gonna
[43:15.440 --> 43:20.040]  beat you I'm gonna crush you I'm gonna bring you down with the American people
[43:20.040 --> 43:24.800]  we are together we have the eye of the tiger we have the vision we are gonna
[43:24.800 --> 43:30.520]  bring you down myself the American people the people that love Liberty we
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.560]  got a hole to you and we're not letting go we don't care we may go down with you
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.560]  but you're going down you understand that and you can't stand up against the
[43:41.560 --> 43:48.520]  spirit like that we see you look at you 350,000 viewers on average on their top
[43:48.520 --> 43:54.640]  shows in prime time you are pathetic no one wants to watch you no one wants to
[43:54.640 --> 43:59.520]  listen to you no one wants to hear what you have to say you are scum you are
[43:59.520 --> 44:06.920]  failures you are done you are so you know what you're like it's like I get
[44:06.920 --> 44:10.720]  invited out sometimes to movie premier parties and stuff and the directors will
[44:10.720 --> 44:14.560]  be cool the producers are all cool down to earth artist but you'll have like
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.120]  mid-level actors that played mid-level parts in the movie who'll be there and
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.920]  they'll be real arrogant to everyone and talk about how powerful they are and be
[44:22.920 --> 44:27.480]  rude to people and yell at the at the guy at the door do you know who I am and
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.160]  all this stuff and it's exactly what you see with mainstream media these are
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.080]  people that couldn't make it in showbiz these are people that couldn't make it
[44:36.080 --> 44:40.160]  in movies these are people that couldn't do it so they went into media and they
[44:40.160 --> 44:44.880]  literally cold-bloodedly look at what the establishment wants and they will put
[44:44.880 --> 44:50.360]  out whatever the establishment orthodoxy is that they think is going to get them
[44:50.360 --> 44:56.680]  ahead in this world and I've used the porn analogy women in porn in its golden
[44:56.680 --> 45:01.720]  era 30 years ago could make five million dollars a year look it up I've seen
[45:01.720 --> 45:07.320]  documentaries on it five million five million dollars the equivalent of about
[45:07.320 --> 45:13.200]  15 million a day do you know what top porn people make now maybe a half a
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.720]  million dollars a year the average person in porn women that look like
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.200]  Marilyn Monroe make about two thousand dollars per shoot and they've got to do
[45:22.200 --> 45:26.280]  incredibly despicable stuff there's just whole wall street journal articles on it
[45:26.280 --> 45:31.280]  you name it that's who you people are that sold out the establishment every
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.320]  farm girl in America went to LA thinking they were gonna be a movie star
[45:35.320 --> 45:39.480]  thinking they had to be fulfilled when they got there they said sorry all we
[45:39.480 --> 45:47.880]  got is porn honey and there was a glut of young women and men were ready to do
[45:47.880 --> 45:54.000]  whatever it took until everybody sold out and so the whole industry imploded
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.640]  and it's the same thing with you people in mainstream media you were such
[45:58.640 --> 46:03.400]  client lap dogs to the corporate executives that just want the public
[46:03.400 --> 46:06.320]  distracted while they loop the country with derivatives and bringing a police
[46:06.320 --> 46:11.920]  state that you sold your country out your birthright your future and your job
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.280]  towards CNN gets a half million dollars or four hundred thousand dollars per
[46:16.280 --> 46:27.600]  episode to put out positive news reports on cutter in the Arab Emirates that's
[46:27.600 --> 46:31.840]  the kind of stuff we're talking about totally discredited total jokes you all
[46:31.840 --> 46:35.760]  sold out to the Nazi party you know you got the Nazi party early on you got some
[46:35.760 --> 46:41.520]  power out of it if you survived the purges but by the end 1943-44-45 you
[46:41.520 --> 46:45.800]  didn't get anything by being in the Nazi party and you guys have all piled on to
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.160]  the Republican blue blood system you've all piled on the Democrats sellout
[46:50.160 --> 46:56.000]  system and you're like hookers that'll turn a trick for ten dollars folks you've
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.760]  driven the market down to nothing and then you sit there in your fake arrogance
[47:00.760 --> 47:04.880]  pointing your finger it's somebody like me who 22 years ago got politically
[47:04.880 --> 47:09.160]  active 19 years ago on air who came up from an organic position of real love
[47:09.160 --> 47:12.880]  of liberty really wanting to defend private property the family the Second
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.680]  Amendment national sovereignty really wanting to have a future wanting to be
[47:16.680 --> 47:22.000]  honorable and you can laugh at it you can make fun of it it's in your head it's
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  all delusion you are the emperors new clothes I want to read you the emperors
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.880]  new clothes before I play a compilation of Pierce Morgan clips on his gravestone
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.560]  before he gets indicted for all his crimes in England the emperors new
[47:36.560 --> 47:41.000]  clothes is a short tale by Hans Christian Anderson and Rick little mermaid
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.640]  about two weavers who propose an emperor a new suit of clothes that is
[47:46.640 --> 47:52.040]  invisible to those unfit for their position stupid or incompetent and we
[47:52.040 --> 47:55.640]  can Google the term emperors new clothes and show folks some of the images from
[47:55.640 --> 48:01.760]  online when the emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes a child
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.520]  cries out but he isn't wearing anything at all the tale has been translated into
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.400]  over a hundred languages and the weavers you know they're charging an
[48:10.400 --> 48:14.440]  equivalent of millions of dollars per outfit they say only the noble can see
[48:14.440 --> 48:16.440]  it well he looks like he's gonna underwear but he doesn't want to say he
[48:16.440 --> 48:21.000]  can't see it no one wants to call him out they're all part of the fad but
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.320]  finally a three-year-old steps up and says the emperor is naked and everybody
[48:25.320 --> 48:31.600]  starts laughing and that's all I've done like Koto pull the the curtain back to
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.960]  show the great and powerful Oz is a little guy wearing no clothes and that
[48:36.960 --> 48:44.400]  is exactly what's going on with Benghazi and Cylundra and fast and furious and
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.920]  just all of this these people I mean Obama lied about Obamacare he lied about
[48:48.920 --> 48:52.720]  NDAA about Patriot Act he made Bush look like an honest person he made Clinton
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.760]  look good and we're sitting here with him parading around with Hillary as our
[48:57.760 --> 49:02.200]  next you know oh it's a woman as the next empty emperors new clothes fad and
[49:02.200 --> 49:14.200]  and that's what this is is literal fraud empty vapor and now that it's being
[49:14.200 --> 49:20.920]  discovered that there's no responsiveness like a like a cult paying dues to
[49:20.920 --> 49:26.200]  keep the facade up Lockheed Martin Archer Daniels Midland Monsanto Bill
[49:26.200 --> 49:33.360]  Himalayan the Gates Foundation big pharma ads are on CNN MSNBC CNBC Fox as
[49:33.360 --> 49:38.200]  well and that's all they've got is defense contractor ads they don't do
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.600]  negative reports on them and big agra ads so they can take over the farms and
[49:42.600 --> 49:48.480]  it's literally a payoff and it's a total facade like a fake western town out in
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.600]  Hollywood every month Hollywood and they have the facade towns you get the tour
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.080]  of the back lot at Warner Brothers or whatever and you see all those western
[49:56.080 --> 49:59.080]  towns you saw in movies as a kid and there's nothing behind them it's a
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.120]  facade and I'm just here saying it's a facade doesn't mean I have all the

[50:22.920 --> 50:26.800]  media we're not the alternative we are more important than dinosaur media that
[50:26.800 --> 50:31.280]  has shown itself bought and paid for and we have to stop bowing and and

[54:03.600 --> 54:08.320]  back live coming up in the next hour I'm gonna get into more serious news but we
[54:08.320 --> 54:12.040]  are breaking down the fall of the mainstream dinosaur media games are
[54:12.040 --> 54:19.000]  over Putin guaranteed gonna move hardcore into Ukraine with the Soros
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.440]  backed EU takeover overthrowing an elected government and I'm not
[54:24.440 --> 54:28.000]  romanticizing who was in power it's a tug-of-war between Russia and the West
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.560]  but the West is the metastasizing cancer right now so that's it's the same
[54:32.560 --> 54:36.880]  bankers that run the EU that want my guns and want to dumb down my children
[54:36.880 --> 54:41.360]  and want to put GMO on my plate so you know there are enemy and so that's the
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.480]  bottom line we're gonna look at that FDA weighs the risk of three-person
[54:44.480 --> 54:49.340]  embryonic fertilization that is so nightmarish polio like illness found in
[54:49.340 --> 54:53.280]  five California children you know most of these new quote polio diseases they
[54:53.280 --> 54:59.160]  admit in the BBC even in India and Africa are caused by the vaccine and I
[54:59.160 --> 55:03.400]  bet if you research this it's a vaccine induced nerve situation a lot of the
[55:03.400 --> 55:06.480]  inserts you talk about it causing neurological disorders there it is
[55:06.480 --> 55:12.480]  Bill Gates 47,500 cases of paralysis untested vaccines cause a new wave of
[55:12.480 --> 55:15.480]  polio paralysis across India if you scroll down to the bottom of that
[55:15.480 --> 55:22.480]  article it has a bibliography of mainstream news that is reporting all of
[55:22.480 --> 55:31.680]  that so that's the other just the Tribune reporting on it and the telegraph in
[55:31.680 --> 55:36.840]  India so there you go folks you get the shot you get paralyzed but they go oh
[55:36.840 --> 55:41.240]  but we don't call it polio we call it something else like whooping cough people
[55:41.240 --> 55:44.680]  in California keep getting it from the vaccine and the vaccine says it can do
[55:44.680 --> 55:47.840]  that to you but then you go into the doctor and they go there's no side
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.200]  effects you go really can I see the insert you get the insert and it says
[55:51.200 --> 55:58.880]  neurological disorders seizures guion beret narcolepsy epilepsy death auto
[55:58.880 --> 56:05.120]  immune disorders cancer but you said there wasn't any side effects it's
[56:05.120 --> 56:11.280]  incredible so that's coming up but but just to be clear to give credit where
[56:11.280 --> 56:16.120]  to do Pierce Morgan never got any ratings and sunk from the beginning like a
[56:16.120 --> 56:19.680]  guy with bowling balls tied to his feet in the North Atlantic because he was an
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.400]  establishment shill and people are sick of being lectured by pointy-headed no
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.480]  at all liberal trendy control freaks using psych warfare that are literally
[56:28.480 --> 56:33.360]  just angling to enslave this country here's a headline from next gov cost of
[56:33.360 --> 56:40.720]  Obamacare contract has at least quintupled to run the scam websites
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.400]  New York Times cartoons suggest climate change in irish should be stabbed to
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.040]  death and they're calling for crowd hammer to be fired from the Washington
[56:49.040 --> 56:54.600]  Post for daring to criticize global warming because they're liberals you
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.160]  know in Michigan the guy that's the congressman running for Senate
[56:59.160 --> 57:03.160]  publicly is trying to shut down TV channels that run an ad with a
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.160]  constituent talking about how she lost her doctor under Obamacare and he
[57:07.160 --> 57:11.160]  promised he wouldn't but it's on record people are losing their doctors hey

[57:38.120 --> 57:41.600]  Obama has seized the FCC and doesn't even care what the chairman says I'm
[57:41.600 --> 57:49.240]  talking about Obama's FCC can go jump in the lake as they say to use a father's

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.440]  alex jones
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:40.120]  we are now into our number two we got contacted by the Fox brother studios who
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.680]  put out Conrad the Constitution and the Secret Service has been calling their
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.120]  family members and says they're coming to visit them they did a satire piece
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.880]  where Obama is assassinated and I'm gonna be playing that piece and giving you
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.000]  my take on it obviously I don't want the president ever be assassinated I want
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.600]  him to be slowly destroyed like Pierce Morgan and discredited and then later
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.360]  arrested for his crimes which will probably you heard it here first I
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.440]  think Pierce Morgan will get indicted over and I'll be on back in the
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.440]  Britannia because he was running the evidence I believe is overwhelming a
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.760]  hacking scandal running a lot of sinister activities over there that make
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.560]  news cores activities pale and significance but definitely he failed
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.400]  when it came to ratings but they emailed Makadu Lee and Makadu and said hi guys
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.920]  they're coming on into bottom of the next hour Alex wanted to meet a forward to
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.760]  you trying to get them on the radio show regarding this oh this is Lee and
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.240]  forwarded it I was reading that part here it is hi Lee and just wanted to let
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.720]  you guys know the Secret Service has been in contact with my family it's
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.160]  coming to interview me sometime about our latest episode if I end up
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.720]  disappearing you'll know why thanks Lee and to Lee and that's Tim Fox so we're
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.520]  gonna get them on the show and find out exactly what they meant by this video
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:01.680]  it's clearly satire Congress having a dream it's of the Lincoln Theater there's
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.800]  been a bunch of movies that came out where Bush was killed and it was a good
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:11.200]  thing death of a president was one of them and that was produced in Canada they
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.560]  have comedians that would talk about killing Bush and they would show Bush as
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.080]  a vampire and stuff and then people showed Obama's a vampire and they said
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.800]  it was racist but I want to be clear a false flag they could run to be an
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.640]  attempted assassination of Obama or the globalist aren't beneath actually
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:31.080]  killing him I've said many times I believe Obama could be the false flag but
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.320]  I'm gonna recap all that at the bottom of the hour when I play Conrad the
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.640]  Constitution latest episode of Don Salazar just posted it up on info wars
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:48.640]  calm right now and then I've got Paul Watson's new top story that is so
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.160]  important actors of video whether we might as well just play his video
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.080]  report as well Paul said probably better than I it's good to have David Knight
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.280]  and Paul Watson and folks that are actually up to snuff to host this show
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.680]  and jacarys close doing a great job with his reports it's hard to be able to
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.000]  actually get appeared in a host three-hour show I think I may throw him
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.280]  in the deep end soon I'm do it Darren McBreen could do it but he's too shy
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.600]  sometimes too much of a perfectionist he has a great job when he hosts the news I
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.680]  wish Darren would do it more his great graphics guy as well but Leanne I think
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.600]  Leanne's getting close to be able to host the show maybe we should have one day
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.480]  and here with David Knight where he does three hours and then has each of them
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.440]  in for an hour with a group of topics they want to cover you know ten minutes
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.760]  of the at a whack because it's not like they're gonna shag way into just doing a
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.560]  regular local show with you know five thousand ten thousand listeners this is
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:47.160]  a million listeners or more an hour and I don't want to make him nervous it's so
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.320]  crazy I can get up front of a crowd like five thousand people and not even be
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.840]  nervous and it's actually not a good thing because a few times I do get
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.280]  nervous is when I actually am more eloquent and give a better oratory
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.240]  display of the repertoire of information in our political discourse in the
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.040]  larger human Congress of exchange of ideas in the transformative animating
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.440]  contest of liberty and an attempt to set brush fires in the minds of men and
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:18.360]  women everywhere because that is the animating contest of liberty to which I

[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.680]  of state-run media now CNN MSNBC New York Times they're all dead now they
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.440]  admit no one listens to them they can't cause a debate they can't stir any
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.120]  discussion the Pentagon the White House bemoans that things like drugs report
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.560]  dot com info wars dot com are actually able to shape debate get people to
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.480]  actually look at certain topics we had Bill Maher on Friday freak out and attack
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.040]  Matt drudge and say how dare him be able to get people to look at certain
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.920]  news items and bemoaned that the reason we can't fix America is because of all
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.320]  the horrible stuff that Matt drudge is linking to that shows how they've
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:45.160]  literally gone to the throwing fits throwing fits over the fact that their
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.960]  audiences are dwindling the problem is there's still a good audience for sitcoms
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.640]  dramas children's cartoons entertainment NFL football and that's where you've got
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.440]  the anti-gun pro-Obamacare anti-family garbage and there's an article that just
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.440]  went up on info wars dot com by Paul Joseph Watson with a video report titled
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:16.480]  Obama seizes control of late night television and when you go into the
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.760]  article Watson breaks down the recent replacement of Jay Leno with Obama
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.000]  cheerleader Jimmy Fallon as part of a White House coup d'etat to take control
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.560]  of late night television with more and more young Americans deserting news
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.920]  networks and getting their information and opinions from late night comedy
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.520]  discussion shows the establishment is moving into using the entertainment
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.840]  industry as its primary conduit for state propaganda this trust in the
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.600]  institution of television news is hovering at all time low which is why
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.400]  one of the few places left with the White House to elicit a sympathetic
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:54.200]  response to its agenda and talking points is cozy make-believe world of late
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:59.440]  night television while Barack Obama is pursuing a chillingly dictatorial
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:06.280]  political agenda based around executive tyranny Jimmy Fallon is helping to
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:12.520]  massage Obama's image as a down-to-earth fun-loving guy that you can trust while
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.360]  Jay Leno savaged Obama in his final weeks as host one of Fallon's first acts
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.200]  was to afford Michelle Obama the platform of the Tonight Show to push
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:26.000]  Obamacare talking points Fallon even once gushed that President Obama booked
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.280]  himself while the media has pondered on the mystery of Leno being replaced he
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.320]  enjoyed consistently high ratings for 20 years the reality is fraggling obvious
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.280]  as Politico and others have reported this is part of the changing politics of
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.280]  late night TV with the Obama White House now moving to seize control of late
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.480]  night television with Fallon acting as little more than a White House spokesman
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.640]  whenever the need arises you can watch the video above and read the articles
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:00.520]  below for more background that is up on info wars calm and prison planet calm
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.960]  so just because we're winning the war against CNN and MSNBC you got to
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.760]  understand books you turn on children's cartoons it's pushing socialism anti
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:14.020]  family anti-gun Obamacare you turn on NFL same thing you turn on late night
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:19.800]  shows it's the same deal and if you criticize Obama in any way you're off
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:27.160]  the air but then they still kicked themselves off the air by not having a
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.360]  message of freedom and as young people get hit with Obamacare doubling and
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.080]  tripling their costs as they get hit with having their hours cut from 40 to
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.840]  20 hours as they get hit with all this they're not gonna want to hear from
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.360]  trendy Fallon how great Obama is the numbers show even young people are
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.160]  deserting him that's the group Obama says they hope make Obamacare work they
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.200]  hope you're dumb enough to go be part of this how can we not have the Republicans
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.160]  repeal this when it's a total win issue because they're part of the same power
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.680]  structure and you point out to liberal Democrats that the Republicans help
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.640]  right this it's the Republican and Democratic leadership against the Tea
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.520]  Party if you people don't wake up to that you're fools and I'm talking to
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.320]  mainline Democrats is there nothing you people won't buy into why because you
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.880]  feel like you're a winner cuz somebody like Fallon Jimmy Fallon is cool and he
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.440]  gets up there in a tuxedo and makes jokes and Obama comes on and they high
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:28.240]  five I mean this is so cynical they're praying on you and admittedly praying on
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.760]  you while Piers Morgan blast holes in the Constitution in the Bill of Rights in
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.920]  the Declaration of Independence they are literally trying to blow holes in your
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.760]  basic liberties in your basic freedoms so I thought I'd give the number out what
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.880]  is your take on Piers Morgan do you think it's a big victory for liberty or
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.520]  just another sign that dinosaur media is on the way out eight hundred two five
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.320]  nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:05.080]  and we will get you up and on the air are you gonna be sad to see him go folks
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.680]  he was already had almost no viewers for the three years he was there and he's
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.080]  just got worse and worse but it's part of a trend across the board yes his
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:19.560]  slimy elitist affect only made it that much worse and he admitted by the way I
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.760]  can you know read the quote for folks out there it's up on info wars calm he
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.400]  said look I'm a British guy debating American cultural issues including guns
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.640]  which has been very polarizing and there's no doubt that there are many in
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.160]  the audience who are tired of me banging on about it but that was your mission
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.880]  that was your job so what do what do they do they follow their mission to
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.680]  overthrow our republic but it still discredits them because they're unpopular
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.200]  so they lose the hearts and minds so what are they gonna do they're gonna send
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.440]  the Pentagon in to take over the local blogs and media they're gonna try to buy
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.040]  off the alternative media that is the new media they're gonna try to cognitively
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.640]  infiltrate as Cass Sunstein said at the White House and cause infighting between
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.480]  different groups of libertarians real liberals conservatives constitutionalist
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.120]  that's why if you are pro-liberty and anti-nsa spying and anti-aggressive war
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.120]  and anti-victim disarmament if we can just agree on those libertarian ideas I
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.200]  don't have to agree with you on every issue we got to come together and say
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.640]  hey we want our Bill of Rights we want our Constitution we've got to get to
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.880]  that point we've got to be able to do that we've got to be able to come
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.240]  together and and and admit that the Republican and Democratic leadership at
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.280]  the top are working together to systematically get rid of checks and
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.360]  balances for offshore corporate interests that have seized much of the
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.840]  nation at the highest levels and are literally extracting us as Dylan
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:46.080]  Radigan said Dylan Radigan's been pretty much a Democrat folks but he I
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.920]  could watch his show and most of what he said was true because he's a common
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.920]  sense guy that didn't want to destroy the country just like Ron Paul's a
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.760]  Republican but he's a common sense guy they want to destroy the country they're
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:02.960]  just good people now Bill Maher Rachel Maddow people like that are predators
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.960]  folks who know what they're doing and are doing a party line let's go to this
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.240]  farewell we're not gonna talk about Pears Morgan after this I've been
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.040]  talking about him a lot in the last year since I was on a show but the
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.640]  financial times of London and others say that a record of controversy Pears
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:23.360]  Morgan career at CNN and it begins with he's been axed because he had terrible
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.240]  ratings and it goes on in the second paragraph it's hard to imagine just what
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.520]  Mr. Morgan thought would happen when he invited Alex Jones noted conspiracy
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.160]  theorist gun advocate and anti-government radio host on a show to talk about the
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.040]  right to keep bare arms in the July 2012 mass shooting in a movie theater in
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.800]  Aurora, Colorado and just to stir up further passion Mr. Jones was behind a
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.480]  petition to deport Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan barely managed to get a word in when
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:53.400]  Mr. Jones thought going bouncing from mainstream media controversy to rape in
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.400]  India to Stalin Mao in 1776 commencing again if there were not enough Mr.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.040]  Morgan followed that with a panel debate on whether it was good to shoot Mr.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:10.560]  Jones and then they go on in over 200 articles to cite the beginning of the
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.120]  end of Morgan when he let me on that show let's go ahead and go to a
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:18.040]  compilation anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless people that want
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.840]  to literally create the proven places where more innocents are killed called
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.960]  gun-free zones we're gonna beat you we're gonna vote you out of office or
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.680]  sucking my machine that's why you're going to fail in the establishment knows
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.940]  no matter how much propaganda the Republic will rise again when you attempt
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.200]  to take our guns I think we need to ban gun control laws that keep people from
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:45.320]  being able to protect themselves anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.880]  the the problem is not going to go away if we ban this or that gun we've tried
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.120]  that that doesn't work doesn't even work in England you've had mass murders
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.240]  there all over Europe there have been mass murders the solution is for people
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.200]  to be able to defend themselves at the point of the crime and not wait for 20
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.920]  minutes for the police to come what you just said Mr. Pratt was an absolute lie
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:15.240]  I was in the Philippines physically the day Ferdinand Marcos declared martial
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:20.160]  law and made himself a dictator and the first thing that dictator did he gave
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.160]  the people of the Philippines two weeks to turn in all their guns or it was the
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.880]  death penalty now why would a dictator do that why would he make his number one
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.760]  priority when he took over his dictator to disarm the public my family in the
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.320]  Texas Revolution to get Santa Anna my family was at the core on both sides
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.920]  starting that because Santa Anna came to take the guns at Gonzalez Texas Pierce

[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.360]  they are dying worldwide and alternative media left right center
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.920]  libertarian doesn't matter independent is becoming the new dominant so how was
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.000]  the system gonna strike back I wanted to call Max Kaiser and just see if we were
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.960]  able to snag him and we were he's a syndicated host himself and on RT and
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:56.080]  of course the former top stockbroker no no stranger to this transmission I know
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:03.480]  you're a big appears Morgan admirer Max what is your take on his fall haha yeah
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.080]  thanks a lot Alex now you're sending him back here to Britain where he was
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.880]  already chased out of Britain for insider trading scandal for a phone
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.760]  hacking scandal he went to the America he was on CNN the only reason he was
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.040]  lasting this long was the interview he did with you suddenly his ratings went
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.920]  up and then he didn't do an interview with you anymore his ratings crashed and
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.840]  now you're sending him back here to the UK and everyone in the UK is crying
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.720]  because this is this idiot is coming back here where everyone hated him to
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.400]  begin with you know I'm surprised by how many people hate Pierce Morgan in
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.920]  England in the polls I've seen he's a wildly unpopular person everywhere why
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.640]  do you think they gave him a show because the establishment people like phony
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:54.840]  hacks like him well CNN the whole mainstream media is really his ratings
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.560]  were unbelievably low the CNN's ratings are very very low but with pears Morgan
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.320]  you know he faces some follow-up questioning in operation weeding an
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.160]  operation weeding is related to the phone hacking scandal and it has broadened
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.680]  from news of the world which is Robert Bernock's newspaper to the Sunday mirror
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:20.120]  and the daily mirror where pears Morgan was the editor and of course when we
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.880]  were up when you were last in the UK you interviewed my wife Stacy Herbert who
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.000]  told you about pears Morgan's involvement in the phone hacking scandal and
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.400]  she had direct evidence of that such as he was asked by UK police to give some
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:40.080]  evidence and that never went away you've got the video that you made here while
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.480]  you were in the UK lab we put it on YouTube yeah so now when he comes back
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.400]  they he was just questioned again in December of 2013 he has to face
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.280]  additional questions as this inquiry gets deeper so he's got nowhere to hide so
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.040]  pears Morgan involved in the phone hacking scandal which of course was the
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.400]  tabloids of which he was a part of spying on victims of the 7-7 bus bombing
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.320]  they were spying on the murdered schoolgirls family Millie Dowler so he's
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.120]  really got blood on his hands he's been discredited he's been caught
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.240]  phone hacking breaking the law so he comes back here to the UK to face the
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:23.320]  music well that's right and the video is called Stacy Herbert victim of pears
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:30.400]  Morgan it's up on info wars.com a two-part video in-depth interview with you
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.800]  and Stacy Herbert and hopefully soon she'll come on and talk about this as
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.440]  soon as the indictments come down I mean that's the word is that Lord
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:48.320]  Morgan is going to be indicted soon well the inquiry continues he's he's he's
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:54.000]  he's got dirt on his hands with this situation his he's associated one by the
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.520]  name of Tina Weaver who was the editor of the Sunday Mirror she's implicated in
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.400]  this I don't want to say too much because there there's I'm not anxious to
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.520]  participate he might be innocent this is all alleged there's Morgan is a
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:20.440]  wonderful person right but so this is all coming down and it's gonna be
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.320]  interesting to see because of course as I mentioned he was also running away from
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:28.120]  an insider trading scandal when he was editor of his his tabloid while he was
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.320]  here so he's just nobody likes this guy because he's such a slime ball what does
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.480]  this say though about the rating slide across the board in state-run media like
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:45.720]  CNN it's hard to imagine why they picked pears Morgan to begin with other than
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:51.520]  there's just tremendous cooperation now in propaganda in the UK and the US I
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:58.840]  want to point out that just this past week Tony Blair admitted in in a leak
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:04.680]  that to Rebecca Brooks who was also part of the phone hacking scandal he
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.160]  apparently told her an email that to make the whole situation go away they
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.640]  should create a Hutton-like inquiry to whitewash the phone hacking scandal the
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.400]  Hutton inquiry of course whitewashed Tony Blair's participation in the Iraq
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:25.600]  war genocide and war crimes and then Dr. David Kelly spoke out and that was
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.240]  murdered I want to come back for five more minutes then we're gonna go to the

[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.800]  country have a soft shine now that the games are over Western governments are
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.960]  concerned the smile will disappear and the gloves will come off that's why they
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.320]  launched the attack during it the Western Soros attack during it against
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:16.520]  Ukraine in Russia tug-of-war with Europe over the fate of Ukraine the circus
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.200]  artists dancers and flagbearers hardly had time to leave the stadium after the
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:24.240]  closing ceremony before Russia announced it had recalled his ambassador from
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.000]  Ukraine from consulates in Moscow Russian state television said they don't
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.600]  accept the new government is legitimate and Western governments are saying do
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.200]  not launch your military into the country you've got the eastern area that's
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.320]  mainly Russian citizens you've got the West that was more allied with Germany
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.920]  and World War two and I understand they have a beef with Russia but they should
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.800]  know that the euro will suck them dry and the euro are the ones that spent
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.600]  five billion with the State Department fomenting this and so I'm sure from
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.360]  different perspectives there's different reasons for this the point is the
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:02.440]  detonator the initiator on all this is the West now I don't know Max Kaiser's
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.880]  take on this but I know he's lived all over Europe and covered it so we'll get
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.760]  his take on it but you know I mean I'm for the Arab Spring except it got
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:14.840]  hijacked and in some cases stirred up by the West what is your view Max of what's
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.440]  happening right now in the Ukraine well you know Russia Iran and China we've
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.600]  talked about this before they have a mutual defense pack I guess you could
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:32.360]  call it or it's a Shanghai cooperation agreement and you know China Russia and
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:36.280]  Iran share something very interesting in that they don't have central banks that
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.080]  are controlled by the Fed or the IMF for the World Bank so there's enormous
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:46.280]  pressure by the central banks of the West to seize these operations of Iran
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:49.880]  Russia and China because that's a threat to the central bankers and the central
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.400]  bankers in the West are what feed those enormous bonuses on Wall Street by
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.560]  printing up those trillions of dollars of the quantitative easing but because
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.920]  Iran China and Russia have economies that when in case of Russia of course they
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.000]  have huge natural resources and they don't really need to have a financialized
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.360]  Ponzi scheme like you have on Wall Street so they don't really need to be part of
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.760]  the confederation of corrupt central banks whether it's the ECB the Bank of
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.120]  England Bank of Japan Federal Reserve Bank so that's where the tension is and
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:25.160]  the situation in Ukraine obviously it's another hit piece by you had John
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:29.600]  McCain down there in the CIA looking to stir trouble they're looking to seize
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:37.520]  any assets they can and fund some local CIA sponsored folks and game on the same
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:43.360]  thing we've seen in Central America South America the North Africa this is
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:46.320]  the global insurrection against banker occupation as we've been talking about on
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:51.680]  your show for years it's just been getting larger and more violent as the
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.440]  central bankers want to protect their monopoly and printing the nonsense and
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.820]  giving themselves huge bonuses and letting everyone else starve what's
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.840]  interesting is that in the Ukraine on the economics front the price of food has
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:10.400]  been going up we've talked to you on your show before Alex about when the price
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.760]  of food as a percentage of disposable income gets to around 40% there's
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.240]  usually some kind of violent revolution we saw in the Arab Spring we see it now
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.520]  in Ukraine we see it in historically going back to the French Revolution so
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.960]  that's another byproduct of this money printing is that the poor people who
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.600]  are exposed face-to-face with the rising food costs as a percentage of
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.160]  disposable income when it gets to a certain level they just go into the
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.000]  streets because they've got not exactly max but that's the problem they know
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.600]  when these countries are going to blow up so the Westin triggers its revolution
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.880]  to make sure a real revolution doesn't happen and so instead of the Russian
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.680]  allied government that's obviously got problems they're now going to go with the
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.760]  EU who's already saying they're going to put the Ukraine under debt I mean this
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.680]  is yeah exactly that that's exactly right so that I'm saying no that's what
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:02.360]  you have at work here and just you know going back to the media collapse of
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:07.400]  America for a second and the Pierce Morgan story I just wanted to also bring
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:12.400]  to your attention the comments of Alec Baldwin who's a friend of mine for 30
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.000]  years who just came out today and slammed MSNBC and Huffington Post the so
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.920]  called liberal left media in America as a sham he called Rachel Maddow basically
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:28.760]  two-faced so this is a major admission by somebody who's a huge media presence
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.680]  in the US the headline is goodbye to public life yeah well we read the
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:38.160]  details he's saying that MSNBC is a sham Rachel Maddow is two-faced Huffington
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.600]  Post is a sham they're all basically working for these slime balls at the
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.800]  center of the media cartel what about the story last week Alex of Comcast
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.520]  extorting from Netflix a fee you remember net neutrality we didn't want
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.480]  anyone like a Comcast to come in and turn the internet into HBO or turn it
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:02.040]  into pay-per-view we want it to be end-to-end exactly three now of course
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.160]  Comcast has had their way Netflix is gonna have to raise their prices if you
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.600]  your show because it's on the internet you're gonna have to pay extortion money
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.320]  to your provider of internet services or suddenly people trying to get prison
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.800]  planted and Alex Jones dot com it's gonna be slow that put it put in the
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.680]  exactly and people are already paying for their download via their internet
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.760]  service these companies claiming they need to charge somebody for access to
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.400]  their grid is total fraud and so they're coming after net neutrality they're
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:35.680]  coming internet taxes done instead Aaron Schwartz died for for the sins of
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.440]  the corpocracy but you know you're coming to Oxford University Alex we're
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.200]  doing an interview with you when you're in London you're gonna be taking a

[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:14.440]  keynote to the faculty and private members of Oxford Oxford Hall they didn't
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.880]  invite Pierce Morgan they know they didn't invite a slime bucket like
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:21.720]  Pierce Morgan because let me ask you why do you think the faculty is inviting me
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:26.080]  to come address them that's bizarre because you're a media man I mean you
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.680]  redefined public media in the world that's what they said in their letter
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:36.240]  they said I'm changing the media where the media works absolutely I mean you

[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:15.800]  caller as far as the alternative media I would say there isn't a media other than
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:20.280]  the alternative media no I agree we are the real media the the emerging
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.880]  legitimate vacuum being filled by there about being a real media yes yeah and I
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.440]  listen to talk radio I mean I hate to say this I'd listen to it way too much
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:38.280]  but I choose to listen to you and you are the tip of the spear there ain't no
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:45.760]  doubt about that but there is the other ones around you so many good good men
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:51.280]  out there just listen listen I go on a lot of our affiliates big ones middle
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.320]  size small ones take like Knoxville we're on a big 100,000 watt FM there we're
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.920]  also on one AM outside town WBCR for like 15 16 years but the one in town has
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:05.800]  top ratings and I've been on their morning show those guys are smarter than
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:11.000]  I am there are a lot of great hosts out there who I want to challenge those
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.400]  local stations to start simulcasting with video cams their show and to pay for
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:22.000]  it have subscribers enough to then get a crew and build a staff and then you'll
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.240]  have a real competition of new media and there there will be people that will
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:30.880]  end up being more successful than I've been and I'm ready to step aside oh man
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.760]  I'm so ready I am so ready to be eclipsed I am so ready to not be on point I'm so
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.680]  ready to not be walking point because I'm fearless but let me tell you I've
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.840]  really already cheated death with God's good graces and really made the system
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.880]  very angry and believe me I'm lucky I'm not dead or in prison so anytime new blood
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.560]  comes in that's better than me I'm a platform here ready to lift them up go
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.480]  ahead well we pray for you that's just it's just amazing that all these all
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  these different groups like I listen to the Hagmonds every night you know
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:07.720]  Hagman and Hagman report I'll listen to Steve quail whenever he's on yeah
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:14.120]  great job standale I mean just the guys that have been I mean they have been
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.000]  there throughout the year you notice the key to them as they never end fight you
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.200]  know the real sign is the Cass Sunstein said six years ago the way they're gonna
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.500]  take down the real media is they're gonna infiltrate us start groups and start
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.840]  in fighting and how many times do people that stir up trouble it turns out
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.080]  are FBI informants so you see somebody out there stirring up trouble making up
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:38.280]  stuff about other hosts you ignore them because they're a fed go ahead yeah it's
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:44.720]  just like I love John B. Wells I mean and what he's trying to do I love the
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:49.280]  fact he's doing his own thing a real trailblazer yeah I mean I advise him I
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.560]  said coast to coast is really big I probably I think I would stay there and
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.360]  not do your own thing but he I thought he I thought he could do both but I'm
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.360]  not gonna get the middle of that whole thing I really enjoyed listening to him
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:05.040]  Saturday nights but now he's doing his own thing and but that's that's good
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.960]  cuz that gives another voice and and he gets some great guests on there he's
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.720]  such a good interviewer exactly he's a very talented guys a wonderful voice

[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:12.080]  well we got some bad news just minutes ago one of my favorite comedians Harold
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:17.960]  Ramis of Ghostbusters stripes you name it a great director and writer I was on
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:22.520]  the mancals show like just a year ago and Harold Ramis was on during the breaks
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:28.160]  I was talking to him that was that was cool he's dead Harold Ramis has died of
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.840]  autoimmune inflammatory vasolitis his wife told the Chicago Tribune and
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:36.760]  there's only one way to send him off and that is with one of the most eloquent
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:42.360]  things he's ever talked about the giant Twinkie represents the normal amount of
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.040]  psychokinetic energy in the New York area according to this morning sample it
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:54.440]  would be a Twinkie 35 feet long weighing approximately 600 pounds that's a big
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:59.120]  Twinkie we could be on the verge of a four-fold cross rip a PKE surge of
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.600]  incredible even dangerous proportions we just had a visit from the
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:08.680]  environmental protection agency how's the grid old enough it's not good tell
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:16.240]  them about the Twinkie what about the Twinkie I'm sorry you watch it movie a
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:21.160]  hundred times let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls okay let's talk to
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.080]  him said it's here he's dead but that's funny his humor will live on he wrote
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.680]  that by the way Lisa in Oklahoma you're on the air go ahead
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:36.880]  hi Alex I'm listening from Oklahoma and I believe that the biggest issue down here
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:42.760]  is the gun control and Pierce Morgan is an ass and I used to watch him at first
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:48.760]  if he was charming English but I'll tell you what you did good job but I'll tell
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:59.040]  you I believe CNN by just harness going it's the biggest help for gun control so
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:04.560]  yay CNN exactly Obama's been a big plus for the Second Amendment as well that's
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.120]  the thing if we resist their tyranny it backfires on him great point gotta move
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.480]  to more people quick great point Lisa let's talk to Eric and Tennessee you're
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:15.960]  on the air Eric hey Alex how's it going good brother thanks for calling what's
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:23.320]  on your mind well sorry to hear about Harold Ramis that's sad man absolutely
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:28.440]  so what is your take on Lord Morgan the death of his show oh man it's just like
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:33.960]  Max said ding dong the witch is dead man my hats off to you my hats off to you
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.760]  know Uncle Ted my hats off to Jesse you guys did a great job just putting in
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:44.640]  straight but as far as the media goes I mean I'm the same age you are I mean
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:50.080]  grew up listening to choir right the whole deal when I was growing up we had
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.600]  two four and five on antenna we didn't even have cable you know and now you've
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:00.400]  got all these choices and when you watch something you get a certain review of it
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.320]  depending on what channel you watch now like with Sandy Hook with all that mess
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:11.000]  that was completely staged I mean you could tell it from watching it oh yeah
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.400]  no they definitely staged the actors and stuff I think they really killed some
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.480]  people but it was definitely a White House production definitely I mean I
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:20.520]  wouldn't have had that one way to close your eyes to leave she was a nurse for
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.480]  God's sake and as far as well they have actors go watch this laughing and then
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:30.720]  like her own ago do fake crying I mean it was bad man yeah and like World Trade
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.080]  Center seven but when they showed it on the BBC and they said it already
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.240]  collapsed and then they said we were lying and that video wasn't real and
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.200]  then later they had to admit it was real oh yeah we just keep catching state-run
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:46.360]  media yeah the media has been controlled by the government for I don't know how
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:51.200]  long I would say probably the best part of the past 20 years so I mean you know
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:55.360]  it's it's over form I mean that they just can't win with our numbers you're
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:59.720]  right that's what the Pentagon said four months ago by the way we're gonna go to
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:03.320]  break but Mike in Tennessee I want to start going to you now you talk about
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.000]  Al Jazeera see that yeah what about Al Jazeera buying current they're on all
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.200]  the cable systems this is literally like the Saudi Arabians and the Qataris and
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.120]  the rest of them I want to come back and talk about that because we don't just
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:19.800]  have state-run media we have foreign governments running systems here
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:26.960]  domestically excuse me ladies and gentlemen I got over my pneumonia last

[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:18.120]  Obamacare contract is at least quintupled kind of like the prices are
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:23.000]  online to do a major censorship of people that are called global warming
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.680]  deniers that is all coming up ladies and gentlemen but right now let's jam in
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:33.520]  some more ring-a-dinges let's talk to Mike in Tennessee then Brian in
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:38.560]  Michigan Mikey you heard me yeah I'm talking about the Al Jazeera forget
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.840]  state-run we've got foreign state-run media here don't we well God bless you
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:49.200]  Alex you know I've been wondering what you thought about uh how about I'll just
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:54.880]  here for quite some time you know I'm asking all the lives of the feet in a
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:00.240]  cable news for so long when I finally started listening to you a year or two
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:03.640]  ago it just kind of confirmed and you know you bring a lot of proof and
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.000]  evidence and stuff you just kind of confirm what I already knew you know
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.600]  but now I was always I don't know you know the this Al Jazeera comes through
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.320]  and then finally there's a TV in my life where I get that station so I kind of
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.080]  just look and see what they're talking about I just you know don't know what
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:24.080]  to make of it it seems like they might be talking about different things other
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:29.400]  than than uh other than CNN and Fox talk about but um you know here's the thing
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.520]  about Al Jazeera they're based in Qatar so they're able to put out some truth
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:37.800]  but it's connected to MI6 they've been caught trying to you know get behind the
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.840]  Arab Spring and it's their real trouble Al Gore by the way took hundreds of
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:49.520]  millions in oil money to to sell his little network that he never should
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:53.120]  have gotten before you've got to prove enough ratings even get a full-time
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:59.040]  cable channel or satellite channel and he didn't have that it's a total fraud
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:04.680]  hmm you know I'll um I'll flip through the channel CNN and Fox every now and
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:09.400]  then just to see what they're trying to tell us but uh you know I'm always he
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.600]  you know not really believing anything they say I'm just kind of seeing what
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:16.640]  they're saying and I guess I was just kind of doing the same with Al Jazeera
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.560]  but you know not really knowing what to do you like Al Jazeera what do you
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:26.800]  think of it well you know I like having another source of news you know I
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.440]  certainly wouldn't trust everything that comes yeah same thing with RT you know
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:35.480]  they'll report on the police state here but not the police state in Russia and
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:39.160]  then they'll also they're not too pro gun and stuff and it's just because they'll
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:43.880]  never get out from under their Soviet brainwashing but their pro-state views
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.200]  but it's still good to have some type of counterbalance but how about we don't
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:51.240]  have RT or BBC I mean that they can still be there if folks want to watch
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:55.160]  them how about we have thousands of independent media organizations giving
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:59.640]  analysis reporting regionally internationally that's what's
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:04.920]  beginning to happen and as people fund the new media we will displace the old
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.080]  media and that's happening so and they're gonna try to shut us down and
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:12.440]  since this is not gonna work good points good to hear from you Mike when we
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:17.280]  come back from break I'm gonna go to Brian JD Paul Chris and then we got
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.560]  other callers but I'm gonna go to those first then I'm gonna get into some of
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:24.560]  that news that I was just mentioning that I haven't gotten to yet they're in
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.800]  very very important that we cover some of that I think we should call that

[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:38.840]  Morgan caught with his pants down or appears Morgan appears Morgan and the

[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:46.680]  coming up at the bottom of the hour ladies and gentlemen we are going to be
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:53.440]  talking to one of the fox brothers who puts out a online animated comedy short
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.400]  that promotes the constitution called conrad the constitution it's been out
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:04.120]  for two years that we've featured some of the less racy ones here on air to
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.680]  mainstream standards none of them are racy but there's a little bit of potty
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:12.160]  humor in them Obama ceases control of late night TV is one of the articles up
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:19.680]  on info wars dot com but a don has his new article up on the site dealing with
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:26.480]  the fact that Obama assassination animated satire alerts secret service the
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.000]  secret service has been calling their family members and says they're coming
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.320]  to visit them over the satire piece where Obama who's trying to kill the
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:38.400]  constitution is killed by conrad the constitution during a dream but he's
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.560]  really Abraham Lincoln and it's obviously not a call to actually kill the
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:46.640]  president and the Democrats made all sorts of videos about bush being killed
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.160]  with films like the death of a president 2006 and nothing happened they had
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:54.640]  comedians and video games but we'll see what happens with this in the secret
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:10:02.760]  service the video is up on info wars dot com season 2 episode 8 and so by the
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.120]  way I am featured in it as well so I've now arrived being in a conrad the
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:12.280]  constitution piece by the way I watch stuff like this when I'm on a discovery
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.880]  channel or history channel show people go I saw a discovery history channel I
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:20.520]  go really how was it because I don't watch it even though they send me disc of
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  it I just sat down for six episodes of history channel because the show is not
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.360]  that bad and I can cover you know issues the Illuminati and stuff from history
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:33.840]  without being compromised they take six episodes in one night with me in
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:39.360]  different positions different chairs you know different different setups sitting
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:43.600]  there talking and I'm not bragging it just I'm not really fascinated with
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:47.040]  hearing myself talk about stuff I've said it I know it here it is I don't
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:52.680]  watch it but I do go to drudgereport.com I do go to worldnetdaily.com I do go to
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:57.560]  conrad the constitution I do go listen to other talk show hosts even though I
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.520]  don't I disagree about 5% of what he says I listen to Michael Savage when I'm
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:06.640]  not driving around at night or now in the afternoon if I'm doing chores because
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:12.080]  you know I am into what's real and what's bonafide I don't have to totally
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:17.280]  even agree with it I just agree with what's independent and is promoting
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.320]  liberty in in a basic fashion going against the grain with the system now
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:24.920]  I'm gonna go back to your phone calls from folks talking about Pierce Morgan I
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:28.720]  told you folks this show was canceled the day took it over two million viewers
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.840]  with Larry King within the first year he was down to below a million three years
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:38.640]  later folks three years into this he has a viewership of less than 400,000 on
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:45.240]  average to quantify that it's pathetic we have that many listeners in about 20
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.280]  minutes on this show that's a very conservative number by the way we have
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.800]  over 600,000 people that download the podcast every day from the listen page
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:59.000]  that I don't even promote we have 360 70 million views on one YouTube channel
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:03.600]  all totaled about 550 million views on our YouTube channels we have three
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:09.720]  million followers on our different or likers on our different Facebooks that
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.320]  see our stuff every day we have I mean it's just it's on just the radio show
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:21.080]  terrestrially three million a day three million a day and but again oh my gosh
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.440]  Pierce Morgan people know who he is though because all the other shows play
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:30.320]  clips when he has a Charlie Sheen on or when he has an Obama on but other than
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.520]  that the show itself has almost no viewers when I go on there and say red
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:39.200]  coat try to take our guns to be a new revolution that era on every channel
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:44.240]  that was seen by hundreds of millions but the show itself does not have a
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:49.560]  regular long-term audience and it's unable to steer debate and to push
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.280]  topics out there the New York Times editorial staff two months ago bemoaned
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:58.440]  in the news you can pull this up that they have no relevant effect anymore
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:02.080]  I want to show people that New York Times admits their editorial pages have no
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:07.640]  relevance no relevance in the culture 50 years ago total relevance controlling
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:12.760]  the discourse not the New York Times drudge report calm now like the New
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:16.760]  York Times could do 50 years ago can take an interesting local news story
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:23.240]  mainstream or alternative put it out there and two days later it's a national
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:29.680]  news story with every dinosaur parroting it or covering it that's power that is
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:34.360]  the the fire of Prometheus ladies and gentlemen and we to a certain extent now
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:39.760]  are able to put stories out even if drudge doesn't carry him they always hit
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:44.120]  big of drudge carries them and that's the real thrill is seeing it defeat a gun
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:47.720]  legislation defeat an open border legislation defeat a provision of
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:54.320]  Obamacare because drudge picks it up and carries it exposing them at Copenhagen
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:59.200]  and the climate change garbage there to MSM collapsing New York Times now are
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:02.640]  relevant according to its own writers opinion pieces of no impact on public
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:08.800]  discourse as status media sinks that was from February 5th in another example of
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:12.760]  how the mainstream media is in a state of collapse the New York Times own
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:18.240]  writers told the newspaper that the New York Times opinion pieces are now seen
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.520]  as irrelevant and have no impact on public discourse whatsoever and they
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:26.440]  told that that in the New York Observer interview when more than two dozen
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:29.960]  current and former New York Times writers virtually all of them were
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:37.080]  unanimous and acknowledging that the old gray lady is dead okay illegitimate
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.960]  doesn't matter and I told Politico this when Rand Paul got elected and I said I
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:44.560]  only talked to you so I can tell you how pathetic you are and I'm on a power
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:52.840]  trip I don't say you're pathetic I'm great no no no I mean I tell national

[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:14.920]  the back instead of the front but and you know I got a little bit of trouble

[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.560]  or try to paraphrase the Steve Martin's observation of the perils of comedy but
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:17.560]  one found in the opinion section of the New York Times is downright ugly the
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:21.680]  cartoon which we want to go to and then link to there on screen if we can do that
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:24.880]  folks I want to show people the cartoon again the headline is New York Times

[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.160]  immediately looks at it again in disgusting disbelief icicles can be
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:02.560]  used as self-destructing sabers or dispatching climate change deniers so
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:08.280]  there you go you need to kill people that look the guy that's a climate change
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:12.840]  deniers a white male with a cigar classic communist propaganda why not put a top

[02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:08.960]  think of what a joke it is how the government ships in the drugs the big
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:14.040]  banks on record no one debates it and they catch your high school student with
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.560]  any drugs they'll throw them in jail where they get abused by a bunch of hard
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:21.520]  and criminals and get made to join a gang so they can then be pushers for the
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:25.320]  big banks they can break in your house and rob you to buy more of the

[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.000]  rolls Brian what do you make of the mainstream dinosaur whore media
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:38.120]  prostitute media and free fall at every level the nice cherry on top being
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:44.600]  loving Piers Morgan well Alex I gotta say that finding out that Piers Morgan is
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:49.560]  not going to be on TV anymore is like spending $50 in a coat you haven't
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:54.120]  worn in a year that's a great way to put it it is I think it's better than that
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:25:00.600]  it's about $100 yeah absolutely it's all federal reserve notes anyway so it's
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:06.160]  not worth that much but really I think that the biggest thing aside from them
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:12.040]  discrediting themselves is the apathy in this country you know you watch those
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.000]  Mark Dice man on the street videos and just see you know people are they're
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.040]  completely dissing well that is California and that's the future man
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:24.480]  someone who can hardly talk and if you say for Obama we're gonna kill all
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:28.360]  conservatives they go oh yes and he goes we're gonna kill him now and they go
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.760]  I want to kill him and they're ready they're ready to literally put us in
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.240]  forced labor camps and they'll waddle around in black uniforms above us yeah
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:42.120]  yeah well not me because I ain't going to well fighting against the liberal
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:46.320]  trendy when you're in a death camp and they're raping your wife is treason that's
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.880]  fine I'm a traitor you need to bow to people that can't even talk who watch
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.200]  Rachel Maddow and she tells them how smart they are over and over again great
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:59.000]  point Brian anything else no that's pretty much it you know I just watched
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.640]  they did oh you know I don't take up all your time well you're awesome Brian good
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:06.720]  to hear from you let's talk to another evil person Chris in Kentucky he's
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.600]  probably white two folks the question is are you racist and the answer is are you
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:15.320]  white did you wake up this morning yes Chris do you want to apologize are you
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:19.840]  white oh yes I am a white I tell you that must be a terrorist I'm everything I
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.840]  knew it go ahead racist okay anyway about the mainstream media and this is a
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:28.040]  whole people more and more people I think are starting to wake up they know
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.160]  they're in trouble bottom line is it mainstream media has got nothing to be
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.400]  entertainment you get your info babes doing this who's cooking shows on the
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.880]  weekend I mean that's not news anymore people are figuring it out it's time I
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:44.400]  talked to people and generally out here saying they're sick of mainstream news
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:48.960]  because the reality they're beginning to see and a lot of people are waking up I
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:52.920]  mean that we're scaring them out of here we're getting them out of here it's time
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.680]  that's right and then they all still pose on their big sets like everyone's
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:01.520]  watching them it's all a facade that they have the moral authority that they're
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:05.400]  the boss and and then the White House run media matters with no viewers or
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.360]  readers is always lecturing media who to have on who not we're the boss we're
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.920]  the authoritarian left you're not gonna do what we say and watch us look at look
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:20.280]  at mr. Maddow isn't he handsome exactly and in on our local media all they talk
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:25.440]  about is murders and arrest on people I mean that's not news anymore I mean
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:29.240]  let's get real so yeah they should be talking about fluoride in your water and
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.600]  government corruption and or how the sheriff stood up for the Second Amendment
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.200]  good to hear from you Chris let's talk to Paul in the UK that's the United
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:43.280]  Kingdom what do you think of Lord Morgan I think it's a bit of a new way to be
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:49.840]  honest with you coming from a country that is a very disarmed and basically I
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:55.520]  fire arms trained myself I used to be a Navy cadet and and I know how to use
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:02.280]  firearms and and I would and I know ex-place that they say that gun control
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:09.000]  does not work now and basically it's gone up 200% gun crime and there's roughly
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:19.640]  2,034 crimes per 100,000 in the UK conceptively where there's 466 crimes
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:25.440]  per 100,000 and this is cool this is in America where they still stay true to the
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:30.520]  principles of liberty and freedom that we've lost in these aisles and by the
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:33.880]  way I was about to say you guys had a low crime rate because you were a genteel
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:39.880]  law-abiding society like Switzerland they took the guns and your crime I was
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:44.560]  reading went up tenfold in most areas the muggings the stabbings and the people
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:51.560]  aren't allowed to defend themselves yeah but basically on this on this issue I
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:29:00.280]  was there I was there are organizations in the UK that want to keep it they want
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:05.760]  to restore the right to keep their arms in in this country as a whole but since
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:12.320]  Switzerland adopted our model in the 1500s which is 500 years they've never
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:18.800]  been invaded in 500 years dictators and other people who would never even mutter
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:24.200]  the S-word in their power plants anyway well said sir God bless you and thank you
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:28.040]  for calling yeah they always make it an anti-British thing or anti-UK thing
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:33.520]  this whole gun debate the Magna Carta and then later other acts the right for
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:37.600]  the citizens to have weapons came out of England and became the model for the
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:43.760]  Dutch and then the folks in Switzerland that's actually true and the people that
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:47.880]  were fighting for liberty here had big support in England in 1776 we'll be right

[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.320]  did this in four different states and and it was a European tradition that the
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.480]  systems would try to not let the serfs produce enough food but they would then
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.680]  sneak into the king's land which was about 90% usually and would quietly plant
[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:52.240]  fruit trees quietly plant vegetables and things separately because they could only
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:56.440]  use a tiny plot of what they had and then that was surveilled and taxed so
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:01.880]  people would plant in the rural areas and I'm gonna go out with the film crew on
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:06.280]  some of the hiking bike trails and some of the highway areas up in the trees and
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:11.000]  I'm gonna plant fruit trees I'm gonna plant pumpkin patches depending on the

[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:48.800]  now we are gonna get into an issue of the First Amendment and how far does the
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:53.880]  First Amendment got to protect what you say there have been cases in the news
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:37:03.160]  like death of a president that came out in 2006 that basically lionized a
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:10.800]  fictional character for killing president Bush and it is about the trial of the
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:14.440]  person that kills president George W. Bush and they've had comedians that
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.240]  have come out and talked about killing George Bush and things like that and
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:22.120]  as long as you're not seriously saying kill them or you're not calling
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.360]  brothers to kill them I believe it's protected speech and the Secret Service
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:30.480]  is operated as if it is they do go out and assess to see if you seriously wanted
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:35.440]  harm to come to those people now we have an article up on info wars.com
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:41.160]  dealing with the Fox Brothers studios that are very talented who've put out
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:47.840]  now two seasons of Obama doing battle with Conrad the Constitution and I and
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.000]  Ron Paul and others have featured in some of their past episodes some have
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.600]  gotten millions of views others just tens of thousands but the point is Obama
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:00.160]  assassination animated satire alerts Secret Service so Secret Service responds
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:04.880]  to animation cartoon basically what's happened paranoid national security state
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:10.920]  continues intimidation of dissenting media voices the creators of the YouTube
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:15.280]  animated series Conrad the Constitution say they've been paid a visit by the
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:18.440]  Secret Service concerning their latest work well families been called by them
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:25.240]  they said they're getting a visit entitled Obama assassination and clearly it
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:31.600]  is satire they contacted us and so we got them on in the email and said I just
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:34.080]  wanted to let you guys know the Secret Service has been in contact with my
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:38.400]  family and it's coming to interview me soon about our latest episode if I end
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:44.680]  up disappearing you'll know why the email states and that's from Tim Fox we've
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:52.720]  got Tim Fox via phone and Jay Fox his brother via or other way around we have

[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:00.800]  know and then I'll go off that anyways what I was saying is we have them on the
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:06.040]  line with us and we're going to be getting them on the transmission with
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:13.080]  us coming up here in just a few minutes but first I wanted to air and then give

[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:26.200]  of Conrad the Constitution and so here is the newest thought crime and and
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:30.360]  remember earlier I covered these articles New York Times cartoons suggest
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:34.360]  climate change deniers should be stabbed to death and and and Buzz
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:37.360]  Bissinger and Pierce Morgan said I should be shot and they agreed that they
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:41.760]  wanted to kill me and now they're calling for a crowd hammer and a petition to be
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:48.840]  fired Democrats are because he questioned global warming in the Washington
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.480]  Post column and the New York Times is also going along with that as well so
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.320]  this is where we're going in this country so let's go ahead and play season
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:12.400]  two episode eight of Conrad the Constitution now be careful Conrad there

[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:41.680]  can keep my eyes on you they're in armory Ron Paul's armory the year 2020
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:57.400]  everything's like Chicago burning city drones everywhere the drone picks up

[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:42.600]  coming with us what the hell is going on haven't you heard of my second
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:42:02.640]  amendment what's that I'm sure went down hill in six years I don't think I can
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:30.320]  take much more of this ball I need some fresh air your future self is my god
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:36.040]  I look like hell what happened Obama shredded you Conrad
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:43.160]  at least you back together as best I could but some amendments are gone
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:49.600]  forever but it's sort of a bitch Conrad's house is totally impressive a
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:54.280]  trendy since you have a time machine can we fix all of this wrong yes but it's
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:43:10.840]  not gonna be easy future Conrad is right I don't see any
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:20.840]  other way all right Conrad I'm sending you back to the night before Obama by
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:24.520]  the way I don't want Obama to be attending a community theater production
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:29.060]  of grease I'll actually turn him into a hero we don't want to destroy my Chris
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:36.520]  Morgan and then later in time for fast and furious Minrazi
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:40.520]  hey Chris was I supposed to get the Colombian hookers tonight yeah the secret
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:54.600]  service is busy getting the hookers so they don't see Conrad going in with a
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:44:21.160]  yeah what the hell are you talking about Conrad I traveled in your time machine
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:27.480]  to assassinate Obama time machine I don't have a time machine it's okay it's all
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.840]  a dream passed out from all these paint fumes Conrad get the hell over here where
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:40.720]  I can keep my eyes on you so it was a dream well I guess that makes sense I
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:45.040]  mean I wouldn't assassinate anyone without due process see exactly do a
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:45:07.280]  thing like that exactly in the AA now all right and we're joined by the thought
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:13.640]  criminals I mean clearly it's a satire piece saying you know thus all tyrants
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:19.440]  go basically and pointing out that Obama is the one that kills people without
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:24.480]  due process with the drones with the NDA including US citizens and so it's
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:28.920]  it's really good dark satire totally protected from every angle in my view
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:32.640]  but I want to be clear we're not calling for any harm to come to Obama he's just
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:36.920]  a high-level puppet but it is serious satire like this that will draw
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:43.200]  attention to the hypocrisy now joining us on Skype is Tim Fox and his brother
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:47.480]  Jay Fox on the phone Tim first off your family's been contacted by the Secret
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:51.560]  Service have they come after you as a thought criminal yet have they visited

[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:01.760]  yes the Secret Service did visit me so since we got your email last night
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:05.640]  they've come tell us tell us what happened yeah they they first they came to
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:10.720]  my parents home and my dad gave me a call and said hey the Secret Service is
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:17.160]  here to talk to you and at first I was like a sure dad I was pretty sure he
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:25.960]  was joking with me but like no they're really here and they want to talk with
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:33.040]  you and so I was like okay and so the next that was on Friday night that they
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:39.880]  came there and then Saturday at 12 they came to our apartment here in LA and
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:47.560]  interviewed me so do we have their illustrious names I don't have the names
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:53.360]  on me now well that's okay so tell us what they said they first place they
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:57.440]  came to the door they said I think you probably know why we're here are you
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:03.320]  one of the Fox brothers is like yes like you're with Conrad the Constitution like
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:08.480]  yes I know why you're here and she said yeah Secret Service showed me to her
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:15.800]  badge and they came in they just wanted to talk they said about about the
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:23.960]  episode because they had been getting a lot of calls or emails I assume from
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.080]  concerned citizens yeah good little snitches well I mean the issue is it's a
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.840]  public video and it's clearly satire and it's clearly a bad dream he had where he
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:36.760]  said I don't kill people without due process we would never do that but then
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:40.480]  you point out Obama's doing exactly what's wrong I mean that's the essence
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:46.600]  of it right that's exactly what we were going for and I explain that to them that
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:50.560]  we are of course we would never want any harm to come to the president it's
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:57.320]  clearly satire and that we were trying to point out the hypocrisy of how our
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:02.560]  president will just assassinate American citizens without any due process that
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.440]  has been given to them by their Constitution and just what's going on
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:12.480]  I mean in today's day and age you kind of have to do something a little edgy to
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:18.200]  draw people in well update the article you've now officially been visited so
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:23.400]  how long were they there what else did they say they were here about probably
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:30.080]  five minutes seem longer when you get an interview about Secret Service but yeah
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:35.120]  they basically said we don't believe your issue both of us don't think it's a
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:40.760]  real problem but we are supposed to come out and you know do a follow-up just to
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:44.080]  make sure sure I mean if you wouldn't have had Conrad saying it's wrong to
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:46.880]  kill the president at the end you might have started to have an issue but
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:50.600]  clearly you're saying it's wrong to kill the president until he's been found
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.840]  guilty of high treason and I gotta be honest folks I don't wish any harm upon
[02:48:54.840 --> 02:48:58.200]  the public is that that lionizes him but I mean the stuff they've been
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:02.040]  committing against this country is high treason and if they ever had real
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:05.440]  trials it'd be Nuremberg I mean I'm sorry they'd be hanging most of his
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:10.640]  administration but I'm not calling for that I'm just saying like it is they've
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:14.120]  all committed crimes against this country that are high crimes and no one
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:21.360]  can debate that fast and furious Benghazi the list goes on and on now
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.040]  let's bring in your thought crime brother did you get a visit as well Jay or
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:30.560]  did just your brother Tim get it you know actually so far I've avoided being
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:36.040]  visited by the Secret Service they first came to my parents house and at that
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:42.000]  point in time I was up in LA with Tim but later that night I drove down to
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.840]  San Diego and they missed their opportunity to talk to me well how dare
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:53.640]  you talk about the Lord the Savior as Jamie Foxx calls him this video is
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:56.760]  gonna end up going viral I think it's gonna backfire on the tattletales what
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:01.440]  do you think oh that would be great you know we definitely we would love to
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.960]  get our message out there as many people as possible and you know obviously
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.600]  like you've been saying it's not we're not trying to say that Obama should be
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.800]  assassinated anything we're saying the exact opposite but you shouldn't be
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:18.280]  assassinating American citizens and Conrad says it's wrong to kill the
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.120]  president without due process I totally agree with that and again there's a lot
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:25.440]  people worse than Obama above him he literally is a puppet I want to come
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:28.360]  back in the next segment and just have any thoughts you guys want to add here
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:33.040]  but I mean I think you've done a really great job with these Conrad the
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:38.360]  Constitution videos and animation shorts I think it's good for young people who
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:43.760]  are you know into more comedy oriented stuff so I hope this does backfire on
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:47.240]  them big time but there you go we'll have more with the creators of Conrad the
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:51.640]  Constitution straight ahead I'm worried they could stage a fake
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:55.160]  assassination attempt on Obama as a false flag that's the kind of stuff that
[02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:59.320]  could save his bacon so the last thing we want is anybody going after obozo
[02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:04.880]  Obama or whatever his name is my name is Jessica Arman I'm an activist a GCN

[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:35.920]  next to susan being arrested governors that don't tell the line being arrested
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:41.720]  calls for FCC people even in newsrooms of print publications I mean this looks
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:50.880]  like a reign of terror you want to take that you want me to go you know it's
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:59.240]  very concerning you know the the best of it occurring as far as the relate to the
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:02.960]  first amendment and freedom of the press and of course my brother and I are kind
[02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:07.280]  of concerned but something like that could happen to us but we're not going
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:12.680]  to get put back in the way of getting to keep us from getting our message out
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:17.520]  there so we'll keep making videos sure sure well it's sad to hard to point out
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:21.320]  he's killing people without due process and some idiots out there don't get it
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:24.800]  and think you're being provocateurs Tim what's your take on what I just asked oh
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:29.760]  yeah exactly what you're saying it's really scary and I think what's even
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:35.120]  scarier is just the people like my age and Jay's age and the friends we talked
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:41.080]  to I think a lot of our generation which scares me don't realize the rights we
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.840]  have within the Constitution because I'll talk to people that I you know
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:49.840]  recently just talked to about being visited by Secret Service and about my
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:53.600]  video they're like well they're gonna make you take it down or are you gonna
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:57.880]  take it down like no they can't make me take it down there's this thing it's
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:01.800]  called the First Amendment I'm well within my rights you know and I I just I
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:07.320]  think that's why me and Jay started this show was just to try and educate
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:13.280]  everyone but mostly drop pointed towards the younger generation so that they
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:18.680]  realize that we do have a Constitution while it might be getting chipped away
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:26.080]  every day or not might me but not might be but is it it's still there and we
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:31.640]  can we have to educate everyone and we have to restore it now now what anything
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:34.960]  else the Secret Service asks you what what type of questions that they ask you
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:43.240]  basically they asked they had that they had this list of questions that they
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.280]  typically ask and are you planning to attack the president are you exactly
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:52.720]  yeah the first you know like are you planning to assassinate the president
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:57.080]  how many plans to and they were they were even like I'm sure your answers are
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:03.280]  probably no but and of course they would know and also if you're a part of any
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:08.240]  hate groups you know well a list of founding fathers is hate groups so I
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:13.080]  guess you are well yeah yeah you know a veteran cuz you're in a hate group then
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:18.640]  oh no I'm not a veteran but that's good you're not a hate group okay good I was
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:25.680]  able to get by that question and that that that was pretty much it what's
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:29.560]  coming up next for Conrad Tim and Jay what what's the next episode gonna be
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:34.920]  about well we're not too sure right now I we're just gonna sit back and watch
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:41.120]  what happens and I'm sure well there'll be something that that happens that will
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:46.080]  violate Conrad so these I mean these politicians are really writing the show
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:51.920]  for us there's unfortunately too much content for you have Obama walking
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:55.080]  around in it telling people you didn't write that essay you didn't build that
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:58:00.360]  building and then everybody goes Obama did Obama did and then literally he's
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:04.320]  like a queen bee ant or something and the whole world just comes out of his
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:10.160]  rear end or something maybe that like like everything just assembly lines you
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:17.960]  name it it's like it's a Costco I'd like to see one with that yeah where he's
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:22.080]  like a giant or maybe Michelle Obama is really building it and she's like a
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:26.200]  giant alien queen with this huge bloated belly and like everything
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:30.840]  aircraft carriers you know you name it poetry classical music it all just comes
