[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:27.240]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the eighth day of
[00:27.240 --> 00:32.280]  October 2010 coming up in 30 minutes we have the husband and wife joining us
[00:32.280 --> 00:37.640]  from New Hampshire who are Oathkeepers I actually have the CPS report they cite
[00:37.640 --> 00:41.760]  the fact that he's an Oathkeeper part of a quote militia is the main reason that
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.080]  they took the child and we're gonna get Ron Paul's take on that Congressman Ron
[00:47.080 --> 00:51.000]  Paul joins us for the next 30 minutes we really appreciate him joining us in
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.720]  his busy schedule we're gonna talk about the economy the situation with Iran
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.120]  of course so we talked about a decade ago was now unfolding the financial
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.000]  collapse Congressman Ron Paul thank you for joining us today good to be with you
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.520]  thank you so much is happening but I saw a report yesterday put out by CNBC also
[01:13.520 --> 01:18.480]  zero hedge that the Federal Reserve is now the second largest holder of U.S.
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.740]  Treasury bonds they own 821.1 billion so not just the
[01:23.740 --> 01:28.400]  communist Chinese are are you know basically controlling this country but
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.400]  now the private fellow reserve yeah and obviously they had to do that or
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.800]  interest rates would have popped up but you know in some ways if you're looking
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.440]  for some benefits from that just think when we have true reform there's no
[01:43.440 --> 01:48.480]  reason for the Treasury to pay these bills to the Fed I you know in an effort
[01:48.480 --> 01:53.200]  to go through a transition it'd be nice if we could honor you know the Treasury
[01:53.200 --> 01:57.760]  bills held by private individuals who you know naively bought our government
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.120]  debt but we do not have to pay that when we have our reform we just throw that
[02:02.120 --> 02:05.640]  out because they're holding the debt and if we had a new system it wouldn't be
[02:05.640 --> 02:10.080]  necessary there was a headline in Market Watch at the Wall Street Journal
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.440]  yesterday with one of their analysts saying that they believe it'll be the
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.720]  end of the Federal Reserve by 2012 more and more even mainstream media is
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.960]  sounding like congressman Ron Paul yeah I'm amazed at the progress we've made
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.920]  they with stations like yours and many others and our internet who have joined
[02:27.920 --> 02:33.040]  us you I'm sure you can remember three years ago this was a non-event you know
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.120]  talk about the Fed we were still considered you know way outside cooks
[02:37.120 --> 02:41.800]  to even bring the subject up but it is frequently discussed on the business
[02:41.800 --> 02:45.200]  channels at least not the political channels as much as the business
[02:45.200 --> 02:50.040]  channels they're starting to realize that you know the Fed is responsible so I
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.440]  keep harping at it that if you want full employment that's why I always keep
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.240]  the door open for the left because they always preach we care about the poor and
[02:59.240 --> 03:04.080]  we care about jobs what they do they have to look at monetary policy and just
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.400]  look how this system destroys the middle class the first people to lose their
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.360]  jobs are the people who were supposed to be helped by the Barney Franks of the
[03:12.360 --> 03:17.200]  world and here they they end up losing their houses losing their jobs and who
[03:17.200 --> 03:20.760]  gets bailed out you know the big mortgage companies the big gamblers the
[03:20.760 --> 03:24.480]  ones who made billions of dollars when the bubble was being inflated and now
[03:24.480 --> 03:28.160]  they're still making money but I think the people are waking up I think they're
[03:28.160 --> 03:31.920]  much aware of what's happening the Fed is not going to get off the hook no
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.920]  matter what they do they cannot escape the blame well we've got this outside
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.720]  branch of government that's private that you've tried to audit and now they
[03:41.720 --> 03:45.920]  positioned us to where they're the second biggest owner of our debt along with
[03:45.920 --> 03:49.520]  communist China I don't know which one is worse I mean we're clearly being
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.560]  conquered economically through this fraud but because it is a fraud if we
[03:53.560 --> 03:57.360]  just stand up and say no to it as you said we have no responsibility to pay
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.920]  this money yeah and the time will come I mean the default is on its way and
[04:02.920 --> 04:08.160]  Bernanke actually is very sympathetic to inflation and he also understands that
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.000]  printing money causes price inflation and when you have the price inflation
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.160]  devaluing the currency this literally reduces your real debt so if he can if
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.920]  he can double prices and double it with double in the money supply you know the
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.280]  debt goes down by 50% gosh disappointed that the prices aren't going up fast
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.280]  enough so the devaluation isn't it's bad it's horrible but even once more of it
[04:31.280 --> 04:36.280]  amazing stay there congressman when we come back I want you as an economic
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.720]  expert in this area and who have obviously been part of the testimony and
[04:39.720 --> 04:44.040]  hearing so many times researching this to break down what devaluation of the
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.880]  currency means the fellow reserve was on the news as you know yesterday saying
[04:48.880 --> 04:54.080]  yes we want inflation to fix the debt so explain to people what that means and
[04:54.080 --> 05:00.280]  solutions out of this crisis on the other side with Dr. Ron Paul

[08:00.200 --> 08:08.480]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:09.120 --> 08:13.520]  back in 1999 when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and allowed the
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.760]  private megabanks to start issuing even more counterfeit financial instruments
[08:18.760 --> 08:23.880]  Ron Paul said this will cause this country to collapse this will over extend
[08:23.880 --> 08:28.520]  the Empire and I remember him even putting the number on it you know that
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.800]  that he would say clearly in the next 10 to 15 years well here we are 11 years
[08:33.800 --> 08:39.760]  later and it's not prophecy it's just good economics strong free market
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.080]  understanding of what's happening and the congressman joins us in the short
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.720]  segment we were getting into the situation of the private fellow reserve
[08:48.720 --> 08:54.800]  being the second biggest holder of US treasuries over 821 billion close
[08:54.800 --> 08:58.680]  second to communist China and the congressman has been talking about the
[08:58.680 --> 09:02.720]  collapse that we're going into and we have all the economic numbers there we
[09:02.720 --> 09:07.560]  never left the recession and by most yardsticks we're in a depression so can
[09:07.560 --> 09:11.920]  you give us a forecast from your deep research and the word you're getting up
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.200]  there on the banking committee about where we are congressman Ron Paul and
[09:16.200 --> 09:22.480]  the Fed's signals to accelerate the monetization of debt clearly driving the
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.920]  dollar down and gold up right and although we can be optimistic about
[09:27.920 --> 09:31.040]  what's changing in the country a lot of attitudes are improving there's a better
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.680]  understanding of free market economics and Austrian economics and the
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.240]  importance of gold and and how significant the Fed is in Washington no
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.600]  attitudes have changed Bernanke and others Geithner these guys will just
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.360]  they have their wall and they're back up against the wall so instead of saying
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.600]  hey maybe I was wrong which they're incapable psychologically to do because
[09:53.600 --> 09:58.200]  that means they've invested 30 or 40 years in promoting this nonsense they
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.160]  they can't admit that so the worst things get the more they continue to do bad
[10:03.160 --> 10:08.400]  policy and that is spend borrow and play and and regulate anything regulations
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.600]  can compensate for the market regulating and therefore they can make you know they
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.760]  can do this economic planning through monetary policy so nothing nothing has
[10:18.760 --> 10:23.880]  changed there so what that does it guarantees the prolongation of the
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.480]  problems that we have you have to have the liquidation of debt and they will
[10:27.480 --> 10:32.040]  not permit the liquidation of debt they just transfer the debt from their
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.000]  privileged friends over onto the taxpayers so if you look at all the
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.720]  mortgage debt and the derivatives that's what we bought it's horrible that they
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.560]  have eight hundred and some billion dollars of Treasury bills but they they
[10:44.560 --> 10:48.920]  have over a trillion dollars of all this other bad debt which is probably
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.960]  worthless should have been sold on the market for what the market would pay
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.360]  for it but they bought it for these banks at the nominal rate it's criminal
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.040]  and it's just going to lead us to runaway inflation all that's by
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.360]  government when it gets out of hand the debt gets liquidated it doesn't get
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.280]  liquidated by them for refusing to pay the debt it's liquidated by passing out
[11:12.280 --> 11:15.880]  money that's cheap and that's what devaluation is all about they're
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.200]  devaluing the currency on purpose sticking it to the person who might want
[11:20.200 --> 11:25.240]  to save or who has to live you know close on the margin they get to higher
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.280]  prices they lose their jobs they they lose their savings and Austrian
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.560]  economics and Mies has pointed this out that when you destroy a currency
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.360]  you destroy the middle class and that's what we're witnessing right now that's
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.640]  right all the economic indicators are that the middle class is evaporating
[11:44.640 --> 11:50.560]  before our eyes here's the Wall Street Journal yesterday Fed officials mull
[11:50.560 --> 11:58.200]  inflation as a fix so they've always denied that they were using inflation
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.720]  to basically cover up the massive debts now they've gotten so desperate they're
[12:02.720 --> 12:07.680]  shifting gears and Bernanke saying okay we are in deep trouble we are in a crisis
[12:07.680 --> 12:13.760]  but I've got the solution we're going to further devalue the dollar but the
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.000]  answer is according to his statements in the G20 statement is this coordinated
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.880]  lowering of currencies but but they claim that that would stop any type of
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.680]  currency war but as you know congressman the currency war is now on and so just as
[12:28.680 --> 12:33.720]  we saw Weimar Republic Germany or Zimbabwe in the last few years in of
[12:33.720 --> 12:39.120]  course Africa or a decade ago in Argentina this unfolds the same way every
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.480]  time once you get to a tipping point a flashpoint the devaluation accelerates
[12:45.480 --> 12:51.200]  you've talked about something big and bad come of this way are we nearing a
[12:51.200 --> 12:57.000]  flash implosion point or will it just be a continual devaluation well there
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.800]  we eventually will be a crash of the dollar but the whole policy makes no
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.880]  sense just like we got in the trouble by spending and borrowing and inflating so
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.920]  we do more of it but the whole idea that it's good for the people to
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.640]  depreciate their money devalue the money that means if you have a hundred
[13:14.640 --> 13:19.400]  dollars in the bank tomorrow the next week if they worth 95 or 90 it's a
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.400]  criminal theft is what it what it is but that's what they call good policy and
[13:25.400 --> 13:30.760]  all the countries of the world are doing this and it does go down gradually and
[13:30.760 --> 13:37.160]  it doesn't it doesn't go down you know you can't calculate it if if the Fed
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.760]  increases the money by 10% every year that doesn't mean prices go up 10% you
[13:42.760 --> 13:47.680]  know every year what happens is you know there's a productivity that keeps prices
[13:47.680 --> 13:52.200]  down there's the psychological factor there's trust in the dollars trust in
[13:52.200 --> 13:57.800]  the politicians so you might have a steady erosion of the key currency which
[13:57.800 --> 14:03.000]  is the dollar which has happened since brand woods it's down about 35% against
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.960]  all other currencies so it's hard to measure the destruction of the dollar
[14:07.960 --> 14:13.400]  just against currencies because all the other currencies are not much better the
[14:13.400 --> 14:18.080]  only thing the only true test over the centuries has been the devaluation
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.120]  against gold and gold measures value better than anything else and who wants
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.800]  the value of their gold to go down and in the purchasing power is always going
[14:26.800 --> 14:32.640]  up with the fiat money but here we are have the world competing to find out
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.240]  how fast they can devalue their currencies it's absolutely insane and
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.920]  it's very destructive in the final stages indeed are rapid even though
[14:42.920 --> 14:48.160]  they're erratic as they inflate there's final but there's finally a point in
[14:48.160 --> 14:52.160]  monetary destruction where everybody throws in the towel then they rush out
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.960]  of it and everybody is working hard to prevent the panic and they'll even
[14:56.960 --> 15:00.740]  interfere and get into markets to fight the price of gold to prevent to
[15:00.740 --> 15:05.360]  prevent the panic but when the time comes you know if it looks like it's
[15:05.360 --> 15:09.640]  going to zero or lose a lot you know the Chinese will dump it everybody else
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.120]  will dump it interest rates are going to go up inflation rates are going to go
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.600]  up the economy is going to get weaker and then we as a country will be forced
[15:17.600 --> 15:21.840]  to have monetary reform and we and the only way you can have true monetary
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.520]  reform is you have to monitor you have to change the role of government we
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.760]  cannot continue to be the policeman of the world and run a welfare state and
[15:30.760 --> 15:34.480]  think that changing the monetary system will help because it won't it will just
[15:34.480 --> 15:39.040]  cause more confusion so you have to revamp the whole idea about the what our
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.280]  government should be doing what the role of government is the proper role of
[15:42.280 --> 15:46.920]  government under the law is very limited according to our Constitution and the
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.560]  monetary issue has been well defined in the Constitution so the answers are
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.960]  there and one of these days soon it could be it could be in a year it could be in
[15:55.960 --> 16:00.600]  three or four or five years but it will come but the gradual erosion of the
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.600]  purchasing power of the dollar will continue Congressman looking at the
[16:05.600 --> 16:10.160]  death of the Anglo-American Empire the British Empire of course after World
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.160]  War two kind of folded into the Anglo-American system as Dr. Curle
[16:15.160 --> 16:21.280]  Quigley and others have written show looking at this geopolitically and
[16:21.280 --> 16:29.080]  economically you know and and as a doctor with the analogy I mean are we a year
[16:29.080 --> 16:33.480]  two years three years from the implosion of the Empire and then what
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.720]  comes out of that implosion of the Empire I mean where is the United States
[16:37.720 --> 16:42.560]  going from here well there's no way anybody knows the precise time but you
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.000]  can be certain that if certain events are occurring like the depreciation of
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.680]  money and the continuing plating of the currency it will come but I'm sure we're
[16:52.680 --> 16:58.200]  getting much closer and it could be within you knew a few years now when
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.600]  this happens you can have two of things the status quo will not be maintained
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.120]  because all wealth is being shifted right now like we said it's being shifted
[17:08.120 --> 17:10.640]  away from the middle class and the wealthy and the Wall Streeters and the
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.680]  bankers have all the wealth and they'll probably have a lot of the gold as well
[17:14.680 --> 17:21.080]  so we shift toward going back to our roots and deciding the founders are on
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.920]  the right track and we reinstate those views or we do something what I like
[17:25.920 --> 17:32.040]  what happened to Germany in the 20s it ushered in a militant evil dictator
[17:32.040 --> 17:38.240]  which was Hitler who scapegoated a group of people that he blamed everything on
[17:38.240 --> 17:42.640]  the Jews and the hatred was built and today we have our scapegoats around you
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.920]  know that's hate this group just hate that group blame them for the whole
[17:45.920 --> 17:51.640]  problem so people are ripe for that but in spite of that great danger I still
[17:51.640 --> 17:55.840]  think we're making progress on I think we're really competing very well with
[17:55.840 --> 17:59.480]  those who are demanding a dictator I haven't heard many people at our tea
[17:59.480 --> 18:05.720]  party groups meetings that are demanding ah things are so tough what we need now
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.240]  is a dictator what they want is less government and more power return to the
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.920]  people that's right we've gone through those cycles in the 20th century over and
[18:13.920 --> 18:18.200]  over again people wanting the big strong man on the white horse that
[18:18.200 --> 18:23.480]  Napoleonic or Hitlerian to figure to save them worldwide people know government
[18:23.480 --> 18:28.080]  is the conduit through which mega corporations loot and rob the people but
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.440]  clearly and the Rand Corporation and others admit this and then there's
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.800]  Pentagon reports out of course that we've covered and you've covered where
[18:35.800 --> 18:38.920]  they talked and the U.M. was out last week saying oh my gosh the financial
[18:38.920 --> 18:43.640]  collapse you know is going to cause you know social unrest we better have
[18:43.640 --> 18:50.360]  increased security i.e. police state you know to suppress the population but if
[18:50.360 --> 18:54.040]  the bankers have gutted things so badly that major police departments are laying
[18:54.040 --> 18:58.680]  off upwards of half of their officers they're not going to be able to carry
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.120]  this out but we've seen an acceleration of the Mayak and Homeland Security
[19:02.120 --> 19:06.000]  reports it was on Austin news last night that the government and others are
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.040]  quote training locals to look for right-wing extremist and of course it
[19:11.040 --> 19:13.600]  came out two weeks ago in the head of Homeland Security in Pennsylvania had to
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.880]  step down a foreign company was there being paid by the state to spy on
[19:18.880 --> 19:24.520]  members of the legislature mainline tea parties gun groups anti-war groups so
[19:24.520 --> 19:28.760]  they've got this secret police grid out there and when we look at the scapegoats
[19:28.760 --> 19:34.960]  that have been chosen it's it's Alex Jones it's Ron Paul and so we're the
[19:34.960 --> 19:39.160]  people exposing the real problem and it's it's it's easy to understand why
[19:39.160 --> 19:42.920]  the real perpetrators of this corruption and economic destruction are
[19:42.920 --> 19:46.360]  pointing their fingers at us saying there's the bad men but that's going to
[19:46.360 --> 19:50.400]  be a hard sell you know basically claiming that we're some type of terrorist
[19:50.400 --> 19:55.040]  yeah and I think it will remain difficult I think our side is gaining
[19:55.040 --> 19:59.480]  ground I think the two things that we have to watch for is to make sure that
[19:59.480 --> 20:06.720]  we protect our Second Amendment rights and also that we are able to buy gold
[20:06.720 --> 20:10.520]  and silver when we want because that's your economic one is physical
[20:10.520 --> 20:16.280]  protection one is economic protection and that is is very important and you
[20:16.280 --> 20:20.440]  know they have more regulations now on these 1099s I have to report it by the
[20:20.440 --> 20:26.200]  coin companies and they are gearing up possibly you know to have at least more
[20:26.200 --> 20:30.600]  controls and find out who owns the guns and who owns the gold but you know that
[20:30.600 --> 20:33.880]  the other thing that bothers me a whole lot on this idea I think a lot of people
[20:33.880 --> 20:38.200]  understand this and you and I both talk about you know the bad banks the bad
[20:38.200 --> 20:42.480]  corporations and military industrial complex but I think it's very important
[20:42.480 --> 20:47.880]  not to paint with a broad brush everybody who has made money because
[20:47.880 --> 20:51.600]  there are some corporations who are honest give an honest product they are
[20:51.600 --> 20:57.040]  getting benefits from the government so it isn't profit it isn't bigness that is
[20:57.040 --> 21:01.680]  bad it's only when you have have these people getting the benefits and they
[21:01.680 --> 21:06.240]  call that capitalism and we have to sort that out yeah that's not capitalism
[21:06.240 --> 21:09.160]  that's key because the I mean these social engineers as you know are very
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.200]  smart they're building all this anger towards the free market they're calling
[21:14.200 --> 21:22.920]  this inside crony capitalism capitalism to demonize the free market and as
[21:22.920 --> 21:27.280]  things implode the collectivists are going to try to sell the giant hoard of
[21:27.280 --> 21:31.760]  poor people on looting what's left for the middle class in the name of socket
[21:31.760 --> 21:37.120]  it to the rich guy and they have to also remember that in fascism the title of
[21:37.120 --> 21:41.760]  companies in the land doesn't go over to the government and it just is the
[21:41.760 --> 21:44.880]  controls so the controls are there I mean what can you do in business these
[21:44.880 --> 21:50.280]  days without asking permission from a 32 different agencies of government and
[21:50.280 --> 21:55.480]  what in the use of your land I mean the taxation and the use of your land is so
[21:55.480 --> 22:00.120]  honoris that we really have lost it yet we still have a title and
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.520]  responsibilities for it in order to generate the tax revenues that they
[22:04.520 --> 22:10.200]  want so that's separating that out too often you know the left will complain
[22:10.200 --> 22:14.280]  about a lot of things we're complaining about but whether they're confused on
[22:14.280 --> 22:19.640]  economics or whether they do it on purpose you know they maybe they are
[22:19.640 --> 22:23.560]  you know really promoting socialism so they will like the idea of bashing
[22:23.560 --> 22:29.240]  corporations but at the same time we have to separate the two the corporations
[22:29.240 --> 22:33.120]  that are honest live in versus the one that live off the people well we know
[22:33.120 --> 22:37.840]  the big mega fortune 100 almost to accompany our pro-globalist pro
[22:37.840 --> 22:42.400]  collectivism to collectivize our wealth and transfer it offshore they are the
[22:42.400 --> 22:48.520]  engineers of of socialism of all of this you know New World Order garbage that
[22:48.520 --> 22:51.080]  we're seeing we've only got about eight minutes left with the congressman I want
[22:51.080 --> 22:54.680]  to move quickly sir and we're very appreciative for you joining us in all
[22:54.680 --> 22:59.600]  the great work that you're doing in Washington we also see the system
[22:59.600 --> 23:06.320]  coming in against free speech trying to regulate tax the internet ordering ISPs
[23:06.320 --> 23:10.880]  outside of law saw the headline last week where Obama said well he wants ISPs
[23:10.880 --> 23:16.000]  voluntarily to shut down websites if the government asked just outside of
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.800]  courts they're openly admitting we need a kill switch to turn the web off to keep
[23:19.800 --> 23:25.160]  you safe the system is really getting scared of the internet because of the
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.680]  alternative media can you speak to that well I've been fighting that for a long
[23:29.680 --> 23:33.560]  time because I think that has been such a blessing to us to have have the
[23:33.560 --> 23:39.200]  internet but it becomes politically difficult for me and you probably have
[23:39.200 --> 23:43.480]  been aware of some of my vote sometimes I'm by myself because sometimes they'll
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.800]  say oh we have to do this because this is a bad guy he's involved in drugs and
[23:48.800 --> 23:52.680]  this is a bad guy he could be a terrorist he's a bad guy because he does
[23:52.680 --> 23:57.880]  pornography and on and on I mean they picked the most vicious looking people
[23:57.880 --> 24:01.640]  that have made use to the internet therefore you say oh well we're gonna
[24:01.640 --> 24:08.200]  regulate them no realizing it if you can preempt anybody that might be on the
[24:08.200 --> 24:11.400]  internet because it might be a bad person that means they can preempt us
[24:11.400 --> 24:16.880]  it's a it's a prior restraint on our right to speech and that is very very
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.400]  dangerous and of course most people realize the First Amendment isn't there
[24:21.400 --> 24:27.040]  to protect talking about the weather you know in benign speech it's there to
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.160]  protect us against a very controversial political speech but if
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.480]  it moves in this direction continues to move this way then we are going to lose
[24:35.480 --> 24:42.200]  our right of political speech on the internet congressman dealing with the
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.120]  election coming up we know it's a major political awakening a realignment kind
[24:47.120 --> 24:52.560]  of mainline neocons have come in and tried to dominate many of the races but
[24:52.560 --> 24:56.720]  we see establishment republicans losing in the primaries establishment style
[24:56.720 --> 25:02.160]  democrats losing in the primaries harry reid now in desperate trouble rand 11 to
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.560]  15 points ahead depending on which poll you see but but that doesn't mean he's
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.800]  gonna win we still need to get behind him and support him what can you say
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.680]  about your son's run in Kentucky and how important that is and the overall
[25:14.680 --> 25:20.400]  political realignment happening what do you see coming up in the election next
[25:20.400 --> 25:23.960]  month probably won't be as good as we hope but it's going to be good there's
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.680]  going to be improvement and most everybody is predicting that ran will
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.600]  win but I've urged him not to slow up I mean you got to assume that you have to
[25:32.600 --> 25:37.080]  fight for the last vote but you know there will be a change it will be a
[25:37.080 --> 25:41.960]  message but you know we probably won't get the senate and the republicans
[25:41.960 --> 25:44.800]  still have to prove themselves that they've learned a lesson and if they do
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.880]  pass the good legislation and resist then we they face veto so there's not
[25:50.880 --> 25:55.960]  going to be a dramatic change there may be a significant improvement in in just
[25:55.960 --> 26:00.720]  confidence in the system in that maybe we can slow Obama up which would be
[26:00.720 --> 26:05.200]  pretty good just thinking it if we'd have had a strong republican congress
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.360]  house he just even a house maybe Obamacare wouldn't have been passed maybe
[26:09.360 --> 26:12.520]  we would have been able to prevent some of these things and and since you bring
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.600]  that up just two final quick questions did you see the USA Today article where
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.280]  McDonald's and 29 other firms have been given a federal government exemption
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.640]  they don't have to buy health care but 29 million plus other small businesses do
[26:28.640 --> 26:35.360]  is that not incredible discrimination and and and literal divide and conquer
[26:35.360 --> 26:39.120]  where of you you know or a big corporation you don't have to follow the
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.840]  same rules as the people yeah it doesn't sound like equal protection under the law
[26:42.840 --> 26:46.600]  you know if you were the constitution is very clear if you are going to have a
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.400]  law write a law for any of the legitimate function of the federal
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.800]  government it has to be uniform and here what have they done here they have not
[26:55.800 --> 26:58.320]  made it uniform they shouldn't have made the law in the first place it was
[26:58.320 --> 27:01.920]  illegal so then now whether they're implementing it it's not even legal
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.880]  either because it's not uniform so and that means that those numbers of people
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.640]  say okay I don't have to worry they took me out of it but just think you know
[27:10.640 --> 27:17.120]  maybe maybe the insiders think hey you know we have everybody you know working
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.040]  at McDonald's another place and then they're losing their jobs are they
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.520]  they're their salary or you know salaries go down or something like that
[27:24.520 --> 27:29.480]  then they might have you know exerted a lot of pressure so no equal justice of
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.240]  the law that principle should apply and they shouldn't be allowed to do that well
[27:33.240 --> 27:38.600]  it just shows how every basic canon of of our republic of our bill of rights and
[27:38.600 --> 27:42.520]  constitution is just being completely flush final question we've got about a
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.600]  minute and a half on this you've got some time I'm sure you've seen the
[27:46.600 --> 27:50.840]  Robert Shapiro quotes about what Obama needs as a major Oklahoma City or 911
[27:50.840 --> 27:55.120]  attack so he can appear strong Governor Ridge last year the former head of
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.600]  Homeland Security admitted that in 2004 for the election the Bush people ordered
[27:59.600 --> 28:04.280]  him to put out fake terror alerts which is literally yelling fire in a theater
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.000]  for political gain now we see all these new terror alerts with specific targets
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.040]  right before the election does that smack of an October surprise I mean even
[28:14.040 --> 28:18.320]  if attacks don't take place just the act of saying the terrorists are going to
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.280]  get you and new bin Laden tapes I mean is that look suspicious to you congressman
[28:22.280 --> 28:29.200]  well I think it's just routine I think that state is always want to you know
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.960]  generate fear in the people whether it's economic fear or fear of somebody
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.480]  invading and want to attack because then if you don't go along with what the
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.480]  government tells you then they can paint you as being unpatriotic and un-American
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.000]  so in order for them to survive and them means those people who like big
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.480]  government and statism and world empires they have to have support from the
[28:51.480 --> 28:57.200]  people and the people will tend to give the support if they get frightened
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.720]  enough you know like after 911 they were quite willing you know you're a
[29:01.720 --> 29:06.680]  statement well I know I have to give up my freedom but I'd rather be I'd rather
[29:06.680 --> 29:10.720]  them do that than be killed you know and they were willing to sacrifice their
[29:10.720 --> 29:15.480]  freedoms so fear the fear is the tool of the thugs in government the
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.440]  authoritarian they need to you know beat the drums and then there's once again
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.920]  it's this thing and cry and wolf I mean who believes this stuff anymore that
[29:24.920 --> 29:27.560]  they're about to attack well we don't know who it's going to be or where it's
[29:27.560 --> 29:31.480]  going to be if we did win arrest them so they don't know very much so when the
[29:31.480 --> 29:35.480]  real one comes even if they had good information which generally they don't
[29:35.480 --> 29:39.760]  I mean they but they weren't very good absolutely congressman thank you for
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.560]  spending time with us everybody get behind Rand Paul God bless your Ron

[30:03.640 --> 30:07.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:07.960 --> 30:12.120]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:12.120 --> 30:16.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:16.160 --> 30:20.040]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:20.040 --> 30:24.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.160 --> 30:28.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.480 --> 30:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.840 --> 30:36.520]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[30:36.520 --> 30:40.720]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[34:11.760 --> 34:20.480]  demonized everywhere mr. Rhodes has been demonized the founder of it I've been
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.960]  demonized for supporting it and I remember former narcotics officer who
[34:25.960 --> 34:30.680]  quit over the government being involved in planting drugs on people Barry
[34:30.680 --> 34:35.320]  Cooper three months ago it was in mainstream news that his son was taken
[34:35.320 --> 34:42.280]  by Williamson County his son because and they put in the report we showed the
[34:42.280 --> 34:48.520]  the CPS report it said he told his son don't trust the government and that is
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.840]  illegal according to them there is no law it's the bedrock of our country
[34:52.840 --> 34:55.760]  being founded is don't trust the government Thomas Jefferson George
[34:55.760 --> 34:59.520]  Washington Benjamin Franklin Thomas Payne that's what America's all about
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.560]  it's why we've been the best and brightest and you know produced the most
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.880]  wealth and I've heard of getting calls about five o'clock about this by ten o'clock
[35:08.880 --> 35:13.640]  last night I was here past midnight we were able to get the actual CPS reports
[35:13.640 --> 35:18.360]  that are always filled with lies and disinfo but in the CPS report that will
[35:18.360 --> 35:25.480]  put up on screen for prison planet dot TV members in New Hampshire it says the
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.600]  division became aware and confirmed that mr. Iris associated with the militia
[35:29.600 --> 35:32.720]  known as the Oathkeepers and had purchased several different types of
[35:32.720 --> 35:39.080]  weapons including a rifle handgun and taser and this all started when I've
[35:39.080 --> 35:42.280]  do do's talk to the family I've talked to the family that can correct me if I'm
[35:42.280 --> 35:46.560]  wrong but his wife has a concealed carry she'd left it in the car in New
[35:46.560 --> 35:50.400]  Hampshire if they have different gun laws in the Texas and other areas they
[35:50.400 --> 35:53.520]  pulled them over found the gun and that's when all this started the
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.440]  investigation of them and when they came to take the baby they told them we're
[35:59.440 --> 36:03.080]  doing this because you're part of a militia the police showed up and we've
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.600]  got the photos of them with the sweet little baby the family and we'll put
[36:07.600 --> 36:11.680]  some of those on screen and also we're gonna post them up in the articles that
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.440]  we've got at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com but the headline is
[36:16.440 --> 36:23.000]  government seizes newborn baby over political beliefs of parents government
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.920]  again seizes the newborn baby because the father is a Oathkeeper and they've
[36:27.920 --> 36:33.000]  got the standard nebulous demonization of the family that oh well once we you
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.120]  know got the gun charge on them you know we'd ordered them to go to counseling
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.560]  and they hadn't shown up to that and so there's a newborn baby we're taking it
[36:41.560 --> 36:47.160]  and their final thing in part seven is the division became aware and confirmed
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.400]  that mr. iris associated with the militia known as oathkeepers so you
[36:51.400 --> 36:56.720]  associate with something that isn't even a militia but even if it was that's
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.160]  their right it's a it's a military police group saying we will follow the
[37:02.160 --> 37:05.880]  Bill of Rights we will defend the Republic we will follow our oaths to
[37:05.880 --> 37:10.120]  to to to protect and defend the Bill of Rights the Constitution and the
[37:10.120 --> 37:14.600]  American people from enemies foreign and domestic and again another person I
[37:14.600 --> 37:23.040]  know Barry Cooper son taken and in there they said we took him because you know he
[37:23.040 --> 37:27.120]  told people at school that his daddy had told him you know don't you know don't
[37:27.120 --> 37:30.720]  trust the government and they said that's it you you don't tell your son not
[37:30.720 --> 37:33.440]  to trust the government you don't tell him what George Washington said in
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.160]  America this is the Soviet Union these are the death squads these are the
[37:38.160 --> 37:41.560]  secret police and they always come with some little legalese they did that the
[37:41.560 --> 37:45.680]  Soviet Union and Nazi Germany of why they're doing it every authoritarian
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.720]  state takes people's children so we're joined by Jonathan Irish and Stephanie
[37:50.720 --> 37:54.360]  Taylor Irish his wife we're gonna talk to Jonathan first because they've got
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.920]  they're on one phone but Jonathan I know this is hard for you please break down
[37:58.920 --> 38:04.080]  what's what's happened well I'm not sure where you want me to start Mr. Jones
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.720]  first of all I really appreciate you guys calling me and and having us on the
[38:08.720 --> 38:15.120]  show um well mr. Irish if we don't stand together we're all gonna hang separate
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.560]  so we're when that was an attack on you as an attack on my children go ahead well
[38:20.560 --> 38:28.040]  I'm not sure where you want me to start but essentially she was born 1137 on
[38:28.040 --> 38:37.320]  Wednesday night and we held her and called her for a little while until she
[38:37.320 --> 38:44.440]  fell asleep until about around 2 a.m. and then we put her in the bassinet in
[38:44.440 --> 38:48.440]  the room she stayed in the room with us and Stephanie and I laid down to get to
[38:48.440 --> 38:51.800]  rest but and that's when the vampires come they wait till you sleep then the
[38:51.800 --> 38:59.120]  wolves come well it started it started a few hours later in the morning I had an
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.520]  appointment to get to I came back from the appointment and they came in with
[39:04.520 --> 39:09.480]  the information to do the birth certificate and started giving me issues
[39:09.480 --> 39:15.080]  about putting me on the putting my name on the birth certificate with some
[39:15.080 --> 39:21.480]  cockamamie story of Stephanie's abusive ex-husband and it didn't make
[39:21.480 --> 39:26.280]  any sense to me it was it seemed like a load of cock to me and that's what I
[39:26.280 --> 39:30.040]  started that's what I started really setting up and taking notice and things
[39:30.040 --> 39:36.440]  started really really being out of the ordinary they last and then came back in
[39:36.440 --> 39:40.320]  I had called the New Hampshire State Police the Attorney General's Office and
[39:40.320 --> 39:45.960]  the Vital Records Department in regards to this trying to get some help with
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.760]  this and no one no one would help me well they didn't want your name on the
[39:49.760 --> 39:54.080]  birth certificate because they wanted to use the past problem as they report from
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.760]  years before from the previous marriage they didn't want you having claimed to
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.440]  your child because they wanted to basically go after the child through
[40:03.440 --> 40:13.320]  your wife correct yes they came in when they started giving us issues about the
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.440]  birth certificate we started really taking notice Stephanie had looked at me
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.240]  and said honey I need you I want you to go talk to them about getting us
[40:21.240 --> 40:25.360]  discharged we I want to go home so I went out and I talked to the nurse and
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.160]  they said that they would have the head nurse come in with the pediatrician to
[40:29.160 --> 40:36.080]  evaluate the baby and evaluate Stephanie and excuse me and decide upon a
[40:36.080 --> 40:41.800]  discharge plan well they kept stalling and stalling and stalling the more they
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.080]  stalled the more I went to them and said listen we really need to speak with
[40:46.080 --> 40:49.000]  someone who really want to get going and they kept giving me excuse after excuse
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.880]  after excuse because they were busy getting the judges removal order
[40:51.880 --> 40:59.240]  exactly and they came into the room the bit Cheyenne I thought it was sleeping
[40:59.240 --> 41:04.200]  and Stephanie was laying down in the bed relaxing I was laying down on the
[41:04.200 --> 41:07.560]  couch relaxing because like I said we didn't get much sleep we would wake up
[41:07.560 --> 41:12.920]  to every cool and cough from Cheyenne as any parent knows we're a newborn you
[41:12.920 --> 41:23.720]  know and well we're relaxing the head of security from the hospital comes in
[41:23.720 --> 41:31.480]  with the head nurse and says that they are going to take the child out hold on
[41:31.480 --> 41:35.480]  one second please said they were going to take the child out find out who that
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.400]  is it's all about combat said they were going to take the child to the nursery
[41:39.400 --> 41:44.600]  and have the pediatrician evaluate her so they lied to you to get the child out
[41:44.600 --> 41:50.120]  of the room this is when I really really started knowing something was going on
[41:50.120 --> 41:55.040]  because did you say no yes I did so I said no have the doctor come in here the
[41:55.040 --> 41:58.520]  doctors have come in here the entire time there's no need to take her out of
[41:58.520 --> 42:01.920]  the room they refused to listen to me they took her out of the room without
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.280]  our consent I see I don't know how people handle that and and and we're
[42:06.280 --> 42:10.520]  going to continue but you yourself are a military veteran correct no I'm not sir
[42:10.520 --> 42:13.320]  okay because I'm going to be clear about that you're just a supporter of
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.840]  both keepers unfortunately they would not allow me to serve in the military due
[42:17.840 --> 42:22.120]  to a disability okay I just wanted to be sure about that I just knew that you
[42:22.120 --> 42:27.920]  were involved with those keepers go ahead well I followed I followed the head
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.880]  of security and the head nurse down to the nursery they on our way down to the
[42:32.880 --> 42:40.480]  nursery I noticed one individual about 20 25 feet from Stephanie's room that was
[42:40.480 --> 42:46.800]  wearing a suit and had a what looked like a detective badge on him and walking
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.520]  down the hall further I saw two more individuals of the same stature and then
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.920]  another individual with wearing a suit and what looked like a detective badge
[42:55.920 --> 43:00.560]  coming in through the double doors into the maternity ward at this point they
[43:00.560 --> 43:06.040]  locked the baby in the nursery I was talking to one of the nurses she was
[43:06.040 --> 43:09.640]  asking how we're doing and I was telling her that we're tired you know we just
[43:09.640 --> 43:12.680]  we just want to go home and bring our daughter home they're like just just be
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.680]  calm we're gonna get your baby soon you know we're exactly exactly we do this
[43:17.680 --> 43:23.000]  all the time this is where we prey on you this is please continue yes sir and at
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.080]  this point the head of security comes up behind me grabs my arm and walks me to
[43:29.080 --> 43:33.360]  the room and says Jonathan you need you need to hear them out you need to have
[43:33.360 --> 43:36.200]  an open mind you need to listen to them you need to hear what they have to say
[43:36.200 --> 43:40.060]  and the entire grab you by the arm so he's he's he's letting you know I'm the
[43:40.060 --> 43:44.800]  authority I've done this a lot and I'm letting you know that you're gonna sit
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.920]  out and hear them out because they know how to calm you down so they get to
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.400]  kidnap the child this has all been done you know millions of times in the US it
[43:53.400 --> 43:57.560]  was done in Nazi Germany they've got it figured out exactly and and I'll get
[43:57.560 --> 44:01.880]  back to what I was saying in a second but I wanted to make it known that the
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.400]  head of security at the hospital and in the concrete where we were has a very
[44:06.400 --> 44:12.360]  very close ties and affiliations with the Epsom police department that we have
[44:12.360 --> 44:18.280]  the issue going on with the fire arm yeah well I mean just continue though
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.560]  let's go to the rest of this now so well they continue to walk me down to the
[44:22.560 --> 44:25.560]  room and saying you need to listen to them you need to have an open mind the
[44:25.560 --> 44:30.080]  entire time on the entire walk to the room I'm saying who are they who are
[44:30.080 --> 44:33.680]  these people who do I need to keep an open mind to who do I need to listen to
[44:33.680 --> 44:39.080]  and he walking in the room sat me down on the couch and as he starts telling me
[44:39.080 --> 44:45.920]  conquered police and DCYF the detectives uniform patrolmen and DCYF
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.920]  social workers walk in the room okay today do they try to make you sign
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.440]  something or they just take the baby they already locked the baby in the
[44:54.440 --> 45:00.920]  nursery at this point they walked in and told me they walked in and asked if one
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.120]  of the uniformed patrolmen asked if he could give me pat me down for weapons
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.000]  and I said I'm sick of the harassment I want to know what's going on with my
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  with my daughter you know tell me what is going on with my daughter and then
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.960]  you can again that's a psychological tactic just to make you feel like you're
[45:16.960 --> 45:20.640]  the bad person and it makes them feel good about what they're doing hey we're
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.560]  about to steal this guy's kid for no reason let's let's psychologically do our
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.440]  ritual of patting him down so we feel good deep down inside that he's the
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.520]  bad man and we're the good guys so accelerate through this how did this end
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.560]  well as he's asking me if he can pat me down I say no I want to know what's
[45:37.560 --> 45:42.960]  going on with my daughter and he says that he says no well we're gonna search
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.680]  you and he grabs me by the wrist puts my wrist behind my back forces me to stand
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.000]  up holds both my hands behind my back as they pat me down so that's official
[45:52.000 --> 46:00.200]  oppression please continue um well uh they pat me down and that that part of
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.200]  it ends ends in the uh sit me I sit back down on the couch and they tell
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.560]  up they tell Stephanie and I that they are taking custody of the baby Cheyenne
[46:10.560 --> 46:18.440]  and that we are not allowed to see her and we asked where this is coming from
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.400]  why this is happening and they refuse to tell us anything all they would say is
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.840]  everything you need to know is in the affidavit and we have the affidavit it
[46:27.840 --> 46:33.840]  says because you're a member of oath keepers whether you are or aren't you
[46:33.840 --> 46:38.120]  I've talked to Stuart Rhodes he just says that you've done some posting and
[46:38.120 --> 46:42.880]  but I mean so what I mean it's a it's a mainline open group supporting the
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.160]  Bill of Rights and so they obviously been spying on you or something I mean to
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.000]  even know that you'd been on their message board and they put in there that
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.160]  this was happening because you supported oath keepers in fact we'll put it back on
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.360]  screen it says the division became aware and confirmed Mr. Iris associated
[46:59.360 --> 47:04.520]  with a militia known as the oath keepers so now no judge no jury no proof they
[47:04.520 --> 47:08.240]  just and it's not even wrong to associate with them this is the secret
[47:08.240 --> 47:11.840]  police you know saying they took your baby because you associate with oath
[47:11.840 --> 47:17.920]  keepers I mean this is incredible correct well one of the sad points of
[47:17.920 --> 47:22.320]  this matter is that they actually did get a judge and I still can't I still can't
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.000]  find out what judge it was that signed this but it's not a real court the
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.680]  family courts aren't real they don't have due process they were set up to be
[47:30.680 --> 47:34.520]  eugenics race hygiene courts these are the courts that ordered hundreds of
[47:34.520 --> 47:38.200]  thousands to be forcibly sterilized we cover that in our film in game these are
[47:38.200 --> 47:41.240]  not real courts these are family destruction implements but go ahead
[47:41.240 --> 47:46.920]  well like I said they they got a judge to sign this under with all these false
[47:46.920 --> 47:51.640]  allegations and false pretenses that they that they listed and outlined in the
[47:51.640 --> 47:57.240]  affidavit but I mean regardless it's not illegal or wrong to be associated with
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.600]  oath keepers I mean I mean this is them admitting that your child's been taken
[48:01.600 --> 48:05.960]  by the commissars by the political officers of the state because you're
[48:05.960 --> 48:09.800]  part of a group that says that or you've supported or associated with a group
[48:09.800 --> 48:16.080]  that that is you're simply saying we'll follow the Bill of Rights correct I mean
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.000]  this is incredible so what so what else did they say to you and not much they
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.840]  attempted to get Stephanie and I to sign to report a matter of fact though they
[48:24.840 --> 48:29.920]  made Stephanie sign it because my name was not on any of it but they can't
[48:29.920 --> 48:34.200]  make you and of course then that paperwork you know agrees that you'll go
[48:34.200 --> 48:37.520]  along with what they're saying and then they send you to their psychiatrist
[48:37.520 --> 48:41.640]  that's hired by them to say you're crazy I mean it's just a totally rigged deal
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.720]  yes it will another thing well like I said I was sitting on the couch while
[48:45.720 --> 48:50.760]  this happened and Stephanie was was sitting in her bed our cell phone was
[48:50.760 --> 48:55.160]  sitting on the table next to her bed next to the hospital bed and I told her I
[48:55.160 --> 48:58.760]  said that I said honey grab the cell phone and turn the video camera on the
[48:58.760 --> 49:06.080]  police and DCYF and the head of security told us no we're not told us no you're
[49:06.080 --> 49:10.000]  not doing that we're not recording this and really a federal judge just rule
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.800]  you're allowed to film the police they've been trying to arrest people for
[49:12.800 --> 49:19.280]  that but so just just total thuggery now yes exactly sir honestly honestly it
[49:19.280 --> 49:23.960]  feels it feels like they're acting as
[49:25.640 --> 49:31.840]  they have sir they do this all the time do you know who runs in most states the
[49:31.840 --> 49:38.680]  majority of the child removal it's Dinecore Dinecore has publicly been
[49:38.680 --> 49:42.320]  caught running giant white slavery prostitution rings I mean they traffic in
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.920]  children so this is just their cover operation here and they've got cops that
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.040]  work for them and they just do it all through this color of law garbage just

[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.440]  up to God and people out there but this is going on everywhere honey I'm I was
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.360]  really involved over a decade ago actually fighting CPS in Austin and a
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.200]  few times watching them take babies from mothers and I opened the door once in a
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.400]  hospital room and the cop was choking the woman to make her sign the paper and
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.080]  I began to just cry I mean I you know my instincts were to physically defend the
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.280]  woman but I knew how the evil system was and I had to sit there and watch them
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.640]  and then they were so lazy they didn't even write down their real name they
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.480]  used a three-year-old piece of paper to take another kid that form to take her
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.800]  kid I mean sometimes they don't even they just use blank forms full of
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.680]  generic lies and you guys are saying that that this is full of lies I want to
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.200]  come back to you in a minute Stephanie McGoing back to Jonathan the daddy
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.520]  Jonathan we're about to go to break but but briefly what are some of the lies
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:27.740]  in this report they tried alleging and that Stephanie I'm sorry they tried
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:33.840]  alleging that Stephanie supposedly told a CPSW worker that I had assaulted her
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.640]  which is which is bogus it's nothing but fabricated make-believe words and then
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:46.920]  there's nothing no evidentiary facts to back this up they have no backbones for
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.280]  what they're saying let me tell you what happened when I had my first child and I
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.840]  learned about it the first time we went in it was like four in the morning my
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.000]  wife's water broke she was in labor and the lady said hon we bring this
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.760]  downstairs this file when I came back my wife said she was asking me how much
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.280]  money we had was I mean to you you know were we doing okay and putting it in a
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.800]  computer and I later learned that goes into the CPS database and if a woman
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.440]  says yeah sometimes we fight it's over and but they don't tell you that you're
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.720]  in a law enforcement interview and that you know you have a right to remain
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.320]  silent fifth amendment and then and then subsequently the next two babies they
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:30.120]  did the same thing but I knew and they've got these hard Queen B nurses most
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.880]  the time we were getting kickbacks for all this it's just pure evil stay there

[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:12.200]  because there's a war on for your mind I've got some really bad news for
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:17.520]  everyone who's tuning in we have received the documents and confirmed them
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:22.160]  Kurt Nemo's doing a detailed report right now I'd seen reports about a year
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.040]  ago the mainstream press the Southern Property Law Center and ADL are in all
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.360]  the public schools now not just the police departments brainwashing the
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:34.440]  police turning them into secret police but they're now working with psychiatrist
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.280]  and CPS workers to take the children of anyone that criticizes the government you
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.520]  saw that with Barry Cooper two or three months ago and it said in the police
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.240]  report he had told his what eight-year-old son not to trust the government
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.760]  and they said we're taking your child you're not allowed to do that in America
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.800]  I mean this is pure intimidation pure evil we've discovered Arte Saveda the
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:02.280]  Austin police chief is involved in this just in a local Austin program you can
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.840]  find it at the ADL in Austin on the ADL Austin website Southern Property Law
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:13.680]  Center and this is their secret police network and they are just unfathomably
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.000]  evil I mean we are now falling under a secret police grid if you are intimidated
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.200]  by them if you don't politically stand up because you're scared of repercussions
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.000]  they're going to win they're going to get everybody and we are having
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.360]  victories in Pennsylvania the head of Homeland Security had to stand down it
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:38.120]  was a Israeli company 125,000 spying on members of the legislature mainline
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  gun grips compiling intelligence files on them surveilling them and putting it
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.080]  into police databases so I guess when the state representative goes to have a
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:51.040]  baby they'll grab it this is the new America and by the way Hitler did this
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.240]  the Soviets did this and it's an attempt to have a form of terror to
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.560]  terrorize everyone and of course in the last five years it's come out that
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.040]  pediatricians now ask your small children behind closed doors does mommy and
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.880]  daddy have a gun do they spank you and then they can you know claim that
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.320]  there's some type of danger and then grab your child they don't tell you your
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.560]  child goes to preschool the next day and you never see him again but going back
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.840]  to Jonathan Irish and Stephanie Taylor they're engaged they had their baby and
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:26.200]  I have the CPS report there in New Hampshire up on info wars.com and
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.920]  present planet.com and they say quote the division became aware and confirm that
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.320]  mr. iris associated with a militia known as oath keepers and had purchased
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.720]  several different types of weapons including a rifle handgun and taser
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.840]  which was completely legal for him to do so this is the new America and I've
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.800]  supported the Free States project and we were only 24 hours into this but they
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.160]  had better all these tens of thousands people that move there to rally against
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.680]  tyranny they need to rally right now with support and I want to bring Bob
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.840]  Chapman into this but going back to mr. Irish and Jonathan and Stephanie do you
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:06.280]  guys have an address a PO box you know save baby Cheyenne or you know stop the
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.560]  kidnappers of Cheyenne so people can you know financially support you but more
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.040]  importantly with there's all these you know groups that fight to see PS we need
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.640]  them to come in we know you got the full oath keepers you know upset about this
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.560]  as well because they just went and found your name and you've been on their
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.880]  message board you know not even a member this shows the secret police grid and
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.320]  you talked about the local police working with these people I mean when
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:37.720]  you go in to have a baby folks they run your database on everybody and it's
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:44.120]  just horrible so how can we support you Jonathan and Stephanie if anyone wants

[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.640]  themselves we received a phone call this morning from the chief of police in
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:20.420]  Epsom telling us that the court date is 14 October at 1300 hours which is 1
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:27.160]  p.m. at Rochester family court in Dover, New Hampshire so the 14th of October

[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.520]  dot com and prison planet dot com we want to thank all the patriots that got in
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:43.200]  touch with us so fast I want to bring Bob Chapman in and I will first is
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.000]  Stephanie have anything else she'd like to add
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.120]  just to help me get my baby home we're gonna try on the problem is we get
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.680]  thousands of calls a month people begging it's it's it's so horrible and
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.800]  and and and to really know how evil these family courts are it's just
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.440]  terrible but we're gonna get a lot as much attention on this so and and of
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.280]  course then we're also educating the listeners of the show to understand
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.680]  what's happening but we also see CPS in famous cases where you'll have a
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.640]  literal crackhead with a four-year-old baby you know who weighs 15 pounds
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.800]  starving to death and the CPS is visiting and admittedly doesn't help
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.440]  when there's real abuse but then when it's healthy families with good babies
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.040]  that they can get around half a million dollars for in many cases in the
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:40.280]  adoption racket they they just snatch them up and and we've got the documents
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.840]  now the Southern Poverty Law Center is heading up a nationwide campaign of
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.400]  terror against conservatives and libertarians I mean we literally are
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:55.720]  being persecuted and it is just unfathomably unspeakably wicked and so
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.960]  it as we research this clearly they admit the documents you were targeted
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:10.320]  and probably by this network yes definitely I mean right now Alex we're
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.600]  such a loss for words I mean Stephanie is literally not only in emotional pain
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:21.200]  but in physical pain we don't know what's wrong we're gonna get her to the
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:30.920]  doctor their phone line cut so we need to call them back we'll get them back
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:34.320]  on the line let's bring Bob Chapman up to comment on what he's been hearing Bob
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.480]  sorry to interrupt your regular time on the show we'll keep you in the next hour
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:42.440]  but obviously this is breaking news this is exactly the type of persecution that
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.360]  you talk about that conservatives libertarians anti-globalists have been
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:52.560]  going through for 50 years in this nation I think you really covered most of it
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.560]  pretty well in as much as it's just simply unfathomable but it's nothing new
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.680]  to you and the listeners and this is the beginning of a big push and they're
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.360]  trying to take children away from families and it is a terror operation
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:16.600]  and Southern Poverty Law Center has been that since its very inception and I
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:23.800]  would expect that it's going to spread even wider and I personally I don't know
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.880]  what to do about it other than to support the people who are being attacked by
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:34.200]  these people I mean Bob it came out two weeks ago that it was an Israeli
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:38.920]  company illegally spying on members of the Pennsylvania legislature we know
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.000]  what's going on nationwide they're the bad guys but they're in the public
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.040]  schools all these federally funded groups they're in their brainwashing they
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:52.280]  give the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center access to elementary kids to sit there
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.280]  and interrogate them about mommy and daddy I mean think about a country where
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.640]  they let foreign intelligence agents come in and break up families I mean you
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.040]  can't met in Dincor you know it'd be in Texas and many other states the number
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.600]  one contractors either the CPS workers are literally battle-hardened mercenaries
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:18.520]  and that's true but you know I think support is all we can do until we find
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.880]  out how we can combat it I mean how do you stop these people they're an agency
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.960]  I mean you do do you do it through Congress I don't have an answer for that
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.840]  let's bring Stephanie back up the mother Stephanie your your phone line cut out
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.200]  anything else you'd like to add I mean you've made the statement that the other
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.640]  stuff they've got in here is complete lies and I and I from reading and this
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.280]  all started correct me if I'm wrong when when when they found a gun in your car
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.760]  how dare you their line dropped again we're not I think they're getting so
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.880]  many phone calls at their house or something's something's going on we'll
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.040]  get them back on Bob I'm gonna try to support them as much as I can but the
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:07.080]  good news is this has been going on for a long time and people kind of ignored it
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:12.280]  now there is incredible outrage within hours of this happening people are
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:18.120]  really starting to get how serious this is but I still like to know where do we
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:25.160]  go to stop these people well it's modern slavery I mean 500 years ago you had to
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:30.520]  pull up on the African coast and conk people on the head to get slaves now
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.880]  they just trump up stuff and grab people's babies when they just do whatever they want
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.680]  well that's for sure and you know the history of that going back into the
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:46.200]  1920s and 30s in the United States and of course the person who runs about
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:53.160]  Southern Poverty Law Center is a pervert in his own right now which certainly
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.040]  doesn't make it any better yeah well that comes out and then what he is
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:03.160]  divorce papers that's right yeah well people can read those online if they
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.800]  want to it's a little too racy for the radio audience but these are definitely

[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.800]  admit that it was his wife's gun who was actually
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.120]  driving the car she was in the car but because it was in a laptop bag
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.360]  so you go out and get their concealed carry and then oh well the gun's not on
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.920]  you we're gonna arrest your husband and then now we're
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.400]  going to take your child because there's a gun charge
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.440]  and we went and searched the internet and found out your husband goes on a
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.440]  message board and talks about freedom i mean this just shows the secret police
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.000]  in america what homeland security is for
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.800]  jonathan tell that story of what happened with the gun
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:14.120]  well i had uh surgery uh i had two infected uh wisdom teeth pulled out
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.960]  surgically that they had to put me under anesthesia for so
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:21.080]  stefanie was driving stefanie drove me to and from
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.040]  the appointment well uh whereas stefanie was driving and
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.200]  since she was uh six seven months pregnant at this point
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.160]  she was exactly 22 weeks pregnant at this point
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:39.720]  she she couldn't very well carry a a handgun in a holster on on a belt where
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.960]  she's wearing maternity pants without a belt loop
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.800]  sure it shows how they want to nickel and dime and and twist things out of a
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.320]  law so so so they pull you over what happens
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.280]  well they were actually sitting in our driveway when we got home
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.040]  okay so you're being watched this is the this is some kind of test case okay so
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.080]  they're sitting in your driveway they're sitting in my driveway waiting for us
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.360]  to get home um again there's there was about six
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.400]  different cruisers three different towns uh sitting there waiting for us
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.000]  and they pulled me out of the vehicle talked to me separately
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.160]  and then asked i mean like i said i was under anesthesia at this point so this
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.800]  is gang stalking and we've seen this in austin
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:22.120]  they will profile a family beforehand knowing a baby's coming to
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.160]  and so they were there to set you up ahead of getting the baby now i
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.040]  understand so so they're waiting at your house what happens
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.640]  uh well they they uh look at stefanie and tell her to tell them where her
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:37.400]  firearm is and she she was scared i mean
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.320]  she's she's a small girl she's only five five feet
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.720]  and about 150 pounds at this point so what happened what happened
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.440]  well the the officer intimidated her into showing her where her firearm was
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.280]  he she had opened the laptop case that the firearm was in
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.040]  and at that point the police officer took it upon himself
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.560]  to take the firearm unload the weapon
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.480]  and walk away with it and and arrest me
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.080]  for possession of a concealed weapon without a permit absolutely incredible
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.120]  so this is how america works with it but the secret police
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.360]  you know they've been taught by the southern parvy law center you're the
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.120]  devil so they're doing a good thing they're
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.560]  they're setting up an extremist they're gonna get that baby
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.800]  that's what they think yeah no this is this is just vampires the literal
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.680]  ghouls in police uniforms having their way
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.080]  and then so i guess you're all you know drugged up on halcyon or whatever they
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:34.520]  gave you for your teeth being removed with sedation
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.400]  dentistry and i guess they took you to jail then
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.200]  they did they they took me in and booked me uh they released me on bail
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:48.680]  they were trying to give me a $50,000 cash bail and they ended up dropping
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:52.200]  that because i i immediately made a couple calls
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.720]  to my landlord and his brother um those of which uh
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.640]  their their oldest brother was a congressional candidate here in new
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.640]  hampshire and immediately they they dropped
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.560]  the bail to uh $35 so whatever happened with that
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.680]  that was a few months ago i mean are you gonna go to prison because your wife
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.360]  had a concealed carry and what's gonna happen
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.560]  no they were they originally tried to charge it as a class beef felony
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:21.640]  uh they immediately within two weeks dropped it to a class B misdemeanor
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:26.360]  because the the case they had i mean are you gonna fight it though because i mean
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.640]  obviously a jury's gonna say what she's got a concealed carry what are you
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.640]  doing oh yeah well you gotta stand up to these
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.040]  goons it's just like they but nationwide are arresting anybody that
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.640]  films the cops and the courts are saying you have a right to do that but it just
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.600]  shows the mindset they want to give us tyranny
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.520]  they love the banks looting america they love the depression they enjoy it
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.360]  and don't worry bad cops you're gonna get everything that's coming to you
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:53.080]  you like the devil you like evil you're gonna get a front row seat to hell
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.760]  yeah and and you know they they sat there they
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.240]  dropped it to a misdemeanor because what they had would have never made felony
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.720]  indictment okay but but but in in the court documents
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.000]  stealing your baby that's what they cite that begins all this
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.440]  yeah and uh so your wife's got a concealed carry

[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.920]  than info wars dot com and so our goal is to raise a hundred
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:30.120]  thousand dollars by the kickoff of the money bomb and we want to raise four

[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.400]  southern poverty law center adl they are pulling out the stops against us
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:02.120]  trying to frame me uh you associate me with a murder of police officers i mean
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.560]  believe me lady it's a miracle and i'm only standing here because of god's
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.320]  protection you know my lord and savior jesus christ and i just put it you know
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.680]  all there and say god whatever your will is but make no mistake we're making
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:17.880]  history when i got ron paul in the line before we went live he
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.960]  he was complimenting me and on how much of an effect i'm i'm having just from
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.320]  what he's seeing in washington and on the streets of america
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.800]  uh and i mean that's a scary thing when ron paul global icon the leader of
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.040]  freedom if you've got to pick anybody you know
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.160]  telling me that uh you know alex you're having a huge effect
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.000]  um you said some other things even more flattering but i'm not going to repeat
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.160]  them the the issue here is he told me some things in confidence as well that
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.240]  i'm not gonna i'm not a liberty to get into it just that and ron paul's talked
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.000]  about how much danger he's in you know before on the show he said yes you know
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  that they could come after me uh you gotta pray for him pray for ron paul
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.560]  they already tried to set him up claiming he kidnapped a woman i mean
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.320]  which he had to admit later wasn't true i mean it's i mean folks this is hard
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.600]  core and and we wouldn't be here and be operating if it wasn't for you and it's
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.280]  the same thing with great patriots like bob Chapman who we're going back to in a
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.920]  moment uh but if you want to donate info wars money bomb
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.480]  dot com or buy the books the videos the materials because
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:16.760]  you know we're in a depression here and the funds are not what they were and

[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.080]  but but did you notice that they were waiting at their house out of the blue
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.280]  and said show us where the gun is and she had a concealed carry
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.120]  and there she was seven months pregnant and and then and then there he is in
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:07.400]  the back having his wisdom teeth out and they take the gun and say this is your
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.440]  gun and it's concealed we're taking you to jail
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.800]  in the supposed live free or die state i have seen this
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.960]  in austin when i was first broadcasting 14 15 years ago
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  and it was a pattern it was always 75 80 year olds
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.480]  in a gentrifying neighborhood where they had a lot beside their house worth a
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.920]  half million dollars uh and the health department we
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.600]  learned was doing actuaries on them after a heart attack or cancer they would
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.200]  come and say you've got three inch grass there's a thousand dollar a day fine
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:39.640]  they wouldn't be able to pay it then the police would come to the door the old
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.680]  man would argue they'd beat him up and arrest him and rolling deling sin and
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.040]  others we interviewed and then they would end up getting their property
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.240]  i mean so they've got networks of criminals within the police departments
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.600]  most cops aren't part of it uh who were running the narcotics the child
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.960]  kidnapping the and and now the and now the federal government's coming
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.240]  into liaison all this clearly this was a setup
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.280]  uh two months ahead of her having her baby and they then cited it to take her
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.760]  baby
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:12.040]  bob what's your take on that it's just absolutely incredible and uh but as
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:16.360]  you say it's been going on for some time and uh
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.520]  some of these kidnappings go back into the 20s and 30s
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.960]  and the stories about boys town and and so this
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.600]  this terrible stuff has been going on for a long long time they've been able
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.960]  to cover it up and now you've got the southern poverty
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:35.480]  law center and the adl involved with the government
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:40.520]  uh you know what are they doing uh private organizations
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:46.120]  uh being a part of government operations i i've never heard of that before
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.680]  well it's like pennsylvania with the israeli massad group i mean on record
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.040]  in the newspaper collecting files on citizens and then
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.600]  having them arrested i mean this is this is this is
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.480]  they're contracting it's like uh when marcus wolf got hired eight years ago
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.080]  former head of the stasi the east german secret police i didn't believe it when
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.560]  i heard it and i went and looked it up and congress funded over a million
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:10.760]  dollars and then it was in der spiegel last week that
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:16.200]  the eu was hired the stasi uh to spy on people
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.560]  you know i i used to spy against the stasi
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:23.800]  and of course the kgb and all those kind of people back in the 50s
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.160]  and so i got a pretty good idea what these people are like
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.880]  and what i couldn't understand was after east germany was merged into west
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:35.400]  germany uh how this man was never tried and put
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.640]  in prison and all of the spies that east germany
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:43.240]  had in west germany they were all let off the hook
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.440]  and all the people who was spying on people within east germany
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.080]  which was about 60 of the population they were all let off the hook
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.520]  and they tortured people to death there's a famous photo
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.440]  uh of right when they were putting the wall up of a east german soldier
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:01.560]  and the family's gotten through but the two and a half year old toddler's
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.720]  gotten caught in the barbed wire he got the baby out hands it to the family
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:10.200]  and they took that guy and tortured him to death but uh you know but but the
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.640]  people that tortured you know the military man to death who would who
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:18.440]  let that baby get away uh no they got hired by america
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.600]  yeah that's right that's right just like uh muler and
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:28.920]  all of those ex gestapo people and uh you know you can look back in the 30s
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.880]  and you can see that they try to do the same thing in the united states as they
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.000]  were doing in germany but they were unsuccessful
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.280]  and now they're trying it again
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.840]  well i've spent a lot of time on this we'll continue to watch it as it unfolds
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:47.000]  key report by curtain emmo going up about
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.920]  counter violent extremist cv e working group homeland security advisory

[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.920]  bob yeah it's the same thing that the germans did
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.920]  and the russians did and even in italy they did it
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.640]  uh you know they had the children well in the case of germany they hit you
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.920]  hit leona uh they had them spying on their parents and anybody who
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.720]  you know um stepped out of line verbally so to speak
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.960]  and you know after the war uh there were a number of films
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:17.560]  regarding that and i guess everybody that saw the films like myself is dead by
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.880]  now but uh we're seeing the same thing over again
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.520]  it was look at how bad nazi germany is they had spies they had checkpoints they
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.880]  they trained children to spy on their parents and now
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.160]  it's out in the news yeah we're training boy scouts to take on vets
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.840]  yeah we're training kids to spy on their parents it's good it's good bob
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:44.200]  that's what they think and of course they baited and switched it they said oh
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:48.200]  this is all to stop al-qaeda and then meanwhile the whole thing is for red
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:56.120]  blooded americans
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:02.040]  bob let's shift gears uh into the economy today uh my first issue is that i
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.520]  want to raise with you is something i brought up to ron paul
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.440]  the communist murdering chinese the greatest mass murderers in history
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:11.640]  are of course for two years the biggest owner of us treasuries
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.800]  but now uh it's no longer the e u or the japanese that are number two
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.800]  the federal reserve now owns 821.1 billion
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:24.440]  dollars they are the second largest owner of us treasuries talk about bankers
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.760]  taking over well that's what they tell you about
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.200]  now they've had swamp agreements with foreign governments
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.400]  they take their currencies usually those six major
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:41.720]  currency countries and uh and they give the us dollar currency which they
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.720]  create a thin air to these countries and what those countries do is
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.680]  they take that money and they go into the market and they buy
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.160]  treasury so they go at auction and they buy for us treasuries with the money
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:57.320]  and they hold the treasuries in behalf of the u.s government
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:02.200]  at the same time what they've done with these swaps in the past
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:07.160]  is the fed will go in and they will sell those foreign country currencies into
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.640]  the market and that will affect the usdx which is a dollar index
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.040]  and that will make the dollar get stronger whenever they want to do that
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.320]  now as far as we know right now they're not doing it
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.000]  they stopped doing it about six months ago but then again we never know what
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.200]  they're doing because they never tell anybody the truth
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.480]  and they've had offshore operations in the caiman islands
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.200]  and right out of london as well where they've been buying treasuries for years
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:37.800]  but they don't tell you about that and i wouldn't be surprised that they weren't
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.840]  carrying two sets of books because they don't want to expose the fact
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.960]  that they have more treasuries than what they're telling you about
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.600]  they also buy agency securities as well which is
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.040]  fanny may freddy mac jinny may and fha papers it's called
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:03.480]  and of course last year they admit to having purchased 1.7 trillion dollars
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:13.080]  worth of toxic waste known as abs nbs and cds which are bonds within
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:21.480]  which there are mortgages and that segues us into the mortgage problem
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:25.480]  and i don't know whether you've discussed this on air as yet uh elix but
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.560]  the record foreclosures going on and the fact that the depression is accelerating
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.040]  well not only that the moves by several states
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:43.240]  to bring rico action against uh bank of america welts fargo
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.480]  a city group and there's one other because i've seen that and now
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.160]  um goldman sacks has been caught all over the country and caught in federal
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.360]  court rating with private thugs and stealing homes
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.640]  that they don't even own so they're now just taking homes from people that
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.360]  don't even own money or some of them are paid for by cash
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.560]  i mean they're they're totally owned and they're trying to take them away from
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.720]  them i even saw that last year on singing in i mean
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.800]  well i mean if they're going to take the uh death benefits of six million
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.800]  veterans when they die which they've announced
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.440]  i mean i mean it's just it's completely out in the open now bob
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:23.000]  the theft is just beyond the belief the criminal syndicate that
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.840]  is in washington and uh uh in in the wall street and as well as banking and
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.760]  insurance and the transfer conglomerates it is beyond
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:38.120]  the list and as wild as the imagination of how diabolical this is
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.400]  i mean you know you hear about criminals when they go to christen
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.880]  for robbing a store or robbing a bank or
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.120]  uh doing something which is class one felony
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:54.680]  these people steal billions billions and billions of dollars
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.480]  and they get away with it and even when they get caught
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:03.000]  they get fined and nothing is ever done because a great many of them
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.360]  belong to the cfr and the trilateralists and
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.840]  the bill de berger group so the alumnus don't get touched
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:15.320]  yeah they're made man they're above the law that's a good way to put it
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.320]  they're made men in their own mafia
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:24.840]  good way to put it anyway they they have an issue with disclosure
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:29.560]  and foreclosure documents uh i had one of the uh
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.760]  subscribers right into me yesterday he says these notes are fraudulent
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.640]  they're forgeries anyone on and on he just quit his job
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:45.000]  working for a large mortgage company and now he's helping people
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:51.960]  uh avoid having their homes taken away but um uh they passed uh
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.040]  in in the house as well as the senate something called the interstate
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.000]  recognition of notarization's act and it's uh
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:08.040]  hr3808 and that was ramrodded by uh democrat robert alderholt
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.440]  in the house and robert casey democrat in the senate
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:19.320]  and by voice of vote they passed this thing and it went to the president's
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:23.800]  desk yesterday and he used a pocket veto on it
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.720]  uh he wants to send it back to get it cleaned up
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:31.240]  and of course uh that's not the reason he sent it back
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.680]  they don't want to put this thing through and have him sign us before the
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.280]  election people will go ballistic tell folks what this act
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:41.640]  does when we come back and then we're gonna get into some other
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:45.560]  economic issues i mean they're they're not even hiding the fact now that they're
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.440]  going to hyperinflate uh that's the wall street
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:51.800]  eternal headline fed is now saying they're going to use inflation
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.320]  to deal with the debt we'll get bob jetman's take on exactly what that means
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:01.160]  and how deep this depression is going to get in the near term stay with us

[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:02.280]  involved a lot of patriots up there uh bob going back to you on the economy
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:08.040]  gold shot up to 1300 and um 60 plus dollars they tried to drive it down
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:14.360]  shot back up 10 dollars again today to 1343 and 60 uh and uh and they're
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:18.040]  announcing because of the federal reserves uh own announcements that they
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.160]  are looking at using quote inflation to fix the debt
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:24.200]  so explain what that means but but finish up with that piece of legislation
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:30.120]  you were just talking about well what it what it would have done
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:36.520]  it would have made it difficult for foreclosure uh victims to challenge banks
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:42.360]  that improperly approve foreclosure and the legislation would have forced
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:46.600]  states to accept documents that were notarized in other states
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:49.720]  under potentially different sets of notary standards
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:53.160]  without verifying any of the documentation that's why when you
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:57.240]  close on a house now they try to have you sign a piece of paper saying oh
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:00.680]  there's any mistakes we're allowed to change any of these contracts that
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:05.480]  they're now doing that and uh i i didn't know that but uh
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:09.160]  that's a good point anyway they had people
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:13.400]  uh involved in these foreclosures who was supposed to
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.520]  verify the documentation legally uh prior to foreclosure and they didn't do
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.760]  that they were signing hundreds and hundreds of
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.200]  these things a day and i imagine they were just making a
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  mark on the paper but the interesting thing about this
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.440]  is the voice vote number one number two the senate did this
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.160]  after the scandal broke out a couple of days ago
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.160]  so as soon as the scandal broke out i'm sure the bankers called
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.520]  their friendlies who they paid off in in the senate
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.120]  and said look we gotta get this thing passed do it on a voice vote
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:52.520]  and off we go yeah to boil it down no record of who voted with a voice vote
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:56.520]  so the criminals get away with it with their constituents but the banks have
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:00.680]  been engaged in all this fraud and taking houses that aren't theirs
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.040]  and so the states were starting to go forward with criminal procedures against
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.760]  them so they're trying to have congress retroactively
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:11.400]  say they're allowed to do this that's right and it didn't work
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.160]  and i don't know what made the president pocket veto
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.920]  um the uh the bill uh you know i don't have any access to
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:24.840]  his mind but i think they were terrified that
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.360]  this would cost them votes and of course it would
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:33.480]  and but the words getting out that they pulled this and try to get away with it
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:38.040]  and they didn't and it's much to their discredit
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:43.240]  and i want people to think about that when they vote for incumbents when they
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:47.160]  go uh to vote in the congressional election
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:52.120]  you gotta get them out of there it's the only legal chance that we've got
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.760]  and if we can get half of them out of there
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:01.000]  we'd be doing well and uh you gotta work on it
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.920]  and uh you know alex and i and people like us we can't do it
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:09.160]  we can't do it ourselves we're just one person each
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:13.400]  but there's millions of you listening to this
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:17.880]  and so you should do it well said bob Chapman i want to do a gold report

[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:54.040]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.120]  solar powered generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:05.480]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.360]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:11.880]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.480]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:19.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:23.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:30.120]  onages number five a solar powered generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:33.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar powered

[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:19.560]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:24.280]  austin texas alex jones we're going to briefly get into
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.480]  gold in this segment and then start taking your calls
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:31.960]  in the next one with bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com alex jones
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.720]  with of course info wars.com this live friday edition
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:39.240]  when this hour ends we go into retransmission don't forget ron paul was
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:42.440]  on at the very start of the first hour is one of the most amazing interviews
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:46.120]  i've ever done with him where he talks about uh just the total tyranny
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:49.400]  taking hold but also the awakening and the fact that we are going to have a
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:53.480]  total financial collapse the question is what will we build on the ashes of
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:56.840]  that or will we let the banksters get even more power out of it
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:01.160]  but they know that they're now uncloaked and their crimes are public so
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.160]  that's why they're going wild with with just levels of
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.080]  thieving and and larceny and just grand theft
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.040]  never before seen in history okay i mean it is just it is just wall to wall
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:18.600]  they're attempting to just normalize a climate of total corruption
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:22.920]  and just have us accept it just like uh you
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.920]  yesterday the the white house announced that 30 major companies like mcdonalds
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:29.960]  and others they don't have to get health care for their employees
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:33.960]  but 29 million small businesses you do i mean
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.400]  that is just completely criminal ron paul agreed with me
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:41.080]  and it's not equal protection under the law it it's it's it's it's like a
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:45.400]  twilight zone episode bob jetman it certainly is
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.600]  a two sets of rules one for them and one for us
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.040]  and uh we cross the line we go to jail they cross the line
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:56.680]  they get their hands slapped and that's really what it's boiled down to and it
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:02.040]  it's permeating all the way up from uh police organizations to homeland
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:05.880]  security and then these private groups like the adl and
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.520]  southern poverty law center and then you get into the foundations
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.360]  and the think tanks and the control of congress with money
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.200]  uh and uh and it just goes on and on uh this opportunity they were going to
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.640]  have in november to change government radically
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.640]  i hope everybody takes advantage of it and that in part
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.480]  is why the gold market is as strong as it is
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:35.000]  i mean they spent quite a bit of money
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.360]  in yardage getting gold and silver down yesterday
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:41.880]  and they turned around like a zombie who wouldn't die
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:45.640]  and just ran right back up again uh all of the gains
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:53.480]  uh in gold and silver and in the shares uh were not uh uh recaptured
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:58.680]  during today's trading because i think a lot of traders uh were concerned
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:05.640]  about the continuation of the rally i was a trader for 25 years
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.800]  and so i i i understand the mindset in thinking
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:15.400]  and uh there's very few uh people who own brokerage firms which i did
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:20.600]  that did do their own trading which i did and it was quite an education
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.880]  and i can see things going on in the market other people can never say
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.200]  it's simply because of experience but this is the biggest bull market
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.600]  in history in in in the last three or four hundred years
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.800]  well gold and silver are going to go right through the roof
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.600]  absolutely we'll continue with gold in a moment but
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.280]  going back to the police colluding and and and setting these people up when
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:45.320]  they had a concealed carry to then say we're going to take your child
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:48.440]  because one of you had a concealed carry but the other person in the car didn't
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.080]  and since the gun was in the car we're going to take your kid
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.400]  i mean is that not racketeering to show uh yeah
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.400]  how these groups collude to violate our rights and make money off of us
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.160]  uh and now have the adl southern property law center involved in our public
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:07.960]  schools uh in an education and with the doctors spying on us i mean this is
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:13.160]  this is a total mafia takeover and certainly as you know and i
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:18.200]  go from country to country and uh i've lived uh in the last eight years in
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:23.240]  eight different countries and i never ever see anything like this
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:26.760]  go on i mean they might be second and third
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:32.440]  world countries but they don't do those kind of things
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:36.360]  well that's why even most of the mexican drug gangs they'll kill the the
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.320]  adults in the car but they won't kill the kids
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.080]  but uh it seems like people running our country it's like a delicacy to hurt
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:46.280]  children they just really enjoy it that's what freaked me out the most
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:49.960]  fighting cps with families here in austin
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:53.320]  over the years is that you go to these things and they're getting off on it
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:05:01.000]  it's always like hot belly demonic cops and cps just enjoying the pain

[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.080]  he said kxan was reporting oh the adl is training
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.520]  you know locals to spot rightly extremists so it's just secret police
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.640]  everywhere and then they think it's illegal they're like you like the
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:20.760]  founding fathers yeah i've got him in the cops show them go well we'll go
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.400]  ahead and take their kid we don't have any reason to but
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.520]  you know you like the bill of rights we're taking your kid i mean
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.400]  and this sounds crazy but it's really going on i want to spend about three
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.080]  four minutes with ted anderson who's been waiting there in the studio for 20
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:39.000]  minutes while i've been talking to bob uh to to uh get into gold bob and
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.920]  ted gold went up to 1361 then they drove it down by 20 bucks it shot back up
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:51.560]  over uh what 13 dollars more today so uh was that profit taking
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:54.920]  yesterday ted uh bob was saying the evidence is they
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.560]  were trying to drive it down again but were unsuccessful
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.720]  yeah i would go with bob on that one i think that was just pure manipulation
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:06.440]  to try to drive the us dollar up and to drive gold down it didn't last for very
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.480]  long it was the strength was the just the the bulls have the market the bears
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:15.160]  are not winning ten what's this might as resources report i see
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.520]  uh and we'll put it back up on screen us mint
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:25.480]  puts a 33 premium on all their coins to try to shut off physical demand
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:29.160]  well what that is what that's about is the us mint is running out of planchettes
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.840]  again it happened last year it's happening again again this year
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.120]  you're going to see us eagles drive up in price we're already seeing it happen
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:40.360]  in the buffalo coin uh it will you know the problem is that
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:44.120]  they they can't keep up with the demand and we're heading here into
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:47.160]  october we're still in the beginning of october though
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.400]  so i expect to see the demand even rise further i mean alex my goodness gold has
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:56.840]  been as high as 1350 and 90 cents today silver at 2333
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.800]  that's despite the fact that they clobbered it yesterday
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.000]  and you know i mean it was such a short-lived thing
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.440]  and then unemployment reports come out today jobless the
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:10.520]  non-farm job report is just you know it gets hammered and then all of a sudden
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:15.720]  goes right back up let me read that cnbc economy sheds 95 000 jobs
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:18.600]  even mainstream media says real unemployment's above 10 percent all
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:23.080]  the economists we talked to say over 22 uh percent that's some of the
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:26.360]  economic numbers there government spending rises nine percent
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:30.760]  in the last quarter 72 000 stimulus payments went to dead people ap
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:34.200]  reports 4.6 billion bridge being built by the state for
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.280]  horses to cross in massachusetts uh china to overtake
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:43.960]  japan and global wealth uh rankings gallup finds us on employment at 10.1
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:47.720]  in september food stamp nation pat mucannon what we've accepted the day
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:53.080]  as a vast uh permanent underclass uh continuing
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:58.280]  with the economic numbers bob give us your brief real
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:03.800]  forecast on just how bad this economy is
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:07.480]  well i expect unemployment to continue to increase
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.720]  and in through june of next year now real unemployment right now
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:16.440]  that's use six with without the birth death ratio is 22 and five eight percent
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:20.920]  it will go up a minimum of one percent to 23 and five eight percent in may
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:26.040]  i remind you that during the 1930s the high of unemployment supposedly was 25
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:29.160]  percent so we're in a depression it's an
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:33.480]  inflationary depression uh with what the government is going to do and is
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:38.440]  doing uh with this qe2 as it's called quantitative easing two
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.840]  they're pouring money into the economy and they're doing it via the repo market
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:46.040]  which is a little in a short period of time i can't explain it
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:48.920]  but that that they're shoving money into the economy
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:54.360]  uh at the rate if you use their leverage of about 90 billion dollars a day
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.440]  and uh they're going to continue to do that they're buying and will probably
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:02.440]  buy all the treasuries i think they're going to have to buy them all
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:05.560]  it's the only way the government can can fund itself
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.240]  okay let's go back then because this is very inflationary
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.480]  and it could lead to hyperinflation well let's go back you've been saying that
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:17.880]  for a long time uh what how big of a deal is it to have the fed signal
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:24.520]  to the wall street journal and others in the last 24 hours that the net that
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:30.040]  quote inflation is the cure to debt
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:35.960]  well it's not but that's what they like people to
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.400]  believe because they know that the result of what
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:43.000]  they're doing is going to be inflationary you get banks
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.200]  which will end up with about three trillion dollars
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.880]  with the changes that are being made within the monetary and financial
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:52.440]  structure they get a trillion and a half right now
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.680]  they're going to start spending that money or lending it and in lending it
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.440]  this sterilized money as it's called becomes monetized
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:04.520]  when you monetize money it becomes inflationary
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.200]  and that's what's happening and it's going to get worse and worse
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.640]  uh they're looking at creating money and credit
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.360]  via fiscal spending small amount maybe 500 billion if they're lucky
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:20.680]  the rest of it the two trillion will come from the federal reserve
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:24.200]  and from the banks that are holding money to sterilize
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.400]  and corporations are sitting on three trillion dollars
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.760]  let me ask you this briefly conservatively
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:35.320]  the type of inflation they're talking about just like when mexico inflates
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:39.560]  uh and devalues the currency to pay off debts or zimbabwe or anybody else
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:43.480]  uh what type of price increases what we see we see oil shooting up to 83
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:46.680]  dollars we see a barrel we see gold shooting up to
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:52.200]  1360 plus uh i mean is that just the beginning
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.480]  yes it is just the beginning i expect a minimum
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.640]  of 14 percent next year and i'm being very conservative
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.400]  it could be 25 or 30 percent and if they don't
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.400]  find a way to employ people and i don't know what else they're going to do
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:11.480]  uh they could be looking at 25 to 30 percent unemployment as well
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:14.920]  it's not going to get better it's going to get worse in all of these safety net
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:19.560]  programs you see uh which are now 42 million collecting food stamps
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:24.680]  uh and in the uh disability from social security
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:28.520]  and uh as well as extended unemployment
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.960]  they're going to continue and it kind of cost billions and billions and
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.880]  billions of dollars and they are inflationary as well
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.360]  well again it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:43.960]  that golden silver is the best option out there
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.960]  uh ted briefly give folks today's uh smoking hot deals
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:52.120]  from minus resources today's radio specials i know you're running out of
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.200]  your gold supplies as you continue to buy it
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:57.880]  then you sell out of it and then you buy more but then it goes up again you're
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:01.320]  able to pass on those savings uh what are the prices on the
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:05.240]  golden silver coins today ted well again alex the best deal that i
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:08.200]  have out there hands down is the creature from jekyll island book with a
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:14.120]  silver dollar i mean that is 26 and 45 cents was silver at 23 33 uh
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.240]  you know that's just such a ridiculous and that's counting the shipping
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.440]  yeah it well that is counting the shipping yeah 650 goes for the shipping
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:25.320]  so really it's 19 dollars and 95 cents for a 1995 book and a 23
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:28.840]  coin uh in the market uh how good of a deal is that bob
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:33.320]  shaman it's a super deal and it does not get
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:38.120]  any better than that and uh the book is a wonderful book in fact in tomorrow's
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:43.000]  issue um i've got a number of uh tapes that uh
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:48.520]  that g. edward griffin who's a friend of mine just did and so for the subscribers
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.880]  they'll be in there for them but uh that's a great deal and and of course
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:59.800]  the the coin deal for the subscription that's fantastic
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:03.080]  and what are some of the other gold coins uh that you've got ted
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:06.760]  that would be the frank at 289 you get a full year subscription to bob
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:10.920]  chatman's international forecaster 1083 for a walking liberty half with

[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:18.600]  older 20 liberties at 1685 and 10 dollar liberties at 858 are a
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:22.920]  good deal uh you know bags of junk silver we have the

[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:35.400]  long list of various different things that you can be picking up from mitis
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:39.160]  and the thing about it is is that like bob is saying the federal reserve right
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.040]  now is resorting in a very simplistic term
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.240]  to the printing press to solve problems economic problems
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.160]  that simply cannot be solved that way the monetization of our currency
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.360]  through the federal reserve system is going to destroy the value
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:55.960]  of what people are saving for you know it's just like ron paul said this
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:59.720]  morning you put away a hundred dollars and all of a sudden tomorrow it's
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:03.480]  worth 90 cents or 90 dollars and then later on it's 85
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:06.600]  dollars then you know yeah the only way to get any
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.880]  protection than i can see is gold and silver here here's the number for those

[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:39.480]  with bob Chapman to get to your phone calls now
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:42.680]  tracy in texas you're on the air welcome
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:46.120]  alex i want to say thank you for the information that you're putting out in
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.960]  the mid 90s it was a catalyst for me becoming a christian
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:56.040]  and for bob i want to know two things how do i keep track of how many people
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:59.160]  are in the gold market and will you come in
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:02.840]  and tell come on and tell us when it's time to dump
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:08.680]  bearing what happened in 1980 well fortunately in 1980
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.000]  i get out in june and i was in the shares
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:19.160]  and mostly and the reason was that when gold went back to
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:26.920]  650 announced from 850 it rallied to around 720 and the stocks went berserk
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.800]  and that's when i get out and they did very well of course
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.640]  um as far as knowing how many people are in gold and silver
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.320]  gee that's hard to know but we haven't even scratched the surface with less than
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:42.280]  two percent and those who subscribe to the
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:45.800]  publication everything that you need to know
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:49.480]  is in there every week i know alex covers the
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.000]  the waterfront so to speak well i cover the world
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.080]  and uh it's a great publication and you should get it in
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:00.280]  in there we'll tell you when they get out yeah but if ever
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.720]  we may never get out incidentally yeah bob let me put it to you this way if
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:08.040]  inflation for 1980 is 2500 conservatively announced
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:11.880]  then if gold goes up backs down goes up backs down i'm staying in it
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:16.520]  and and then as inflation increases it from 1980 it may be 3000 5000
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.920]  announced i mean i mean this is really a month-to-month
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:22.840]  thing gauging it you've got to stay on top of it
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:25.960]  you got to have somebody who knows what they're doing
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:31.800]  historically knows what's going on who lives this and which is myself
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.720]  i lived it for over 50 years you know tracy does that answer as much
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:39.480]  tracy does that answer your question yes so long as bob will come tell us when
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:42.840]  to get out then i feel perfectly secure because i've
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:49.400]  tied everything i own in the gold and silver well tracy i would say this
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.280]  i mean if you really study it you know they may next summer drive it down a
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:56.920]  little bit but if you look at the 10-year graph it only goes back up
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:00.600]  overall it's going up it's market fundamentals if they're devaluing
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.800]  currencies globally if they're saying they're going to use inflation
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:08.120]  to pay off the national debt it's a given that commodities are going to go up
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:10.360]  in price because it takes more of that currency
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:15.080]  to pay for it and you know that's the bottom line here as bob said
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.000]  as you go into a global you know inflationary system it
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.760]  it may never end but but nothing is perfect nothing is totally safe
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.360]  we just know gold and silver from history is a lot better
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:30.280]  uh... then uh... you know owning uh... derivatives
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:35.720]  uh... correct bob oh absolutely i won't recommend g ld and s lv
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.560]  or any kind of derivative because they get leverage in them and you don't need
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.040]  that i mean if you want leverage you go in the
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:45.160]  shares and the leverage is in the earnings as gold goes up
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:49.000]  and a lot of this is a rocket science great at numismatic coins
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.080]  is leveraging because there's only so many of them yeah thank you tricey
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.120]  fred in ohio you're on the air
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:01.000]  hello alex how we're doing today good i've got a couple questions for bob here
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.480]  and the first place without auditing the fed
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:11.240]  how do we know that the national debt is only thirteen trillion dollars
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:16.520]  and then my second question is that with these derivatives
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:20.200]  that uh... bill clinton started
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:25.560]  that's estimated at a thousand trillion dollars around the world
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.360]  what portion of that is of ours
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:36.520]  well first of all the uh... the deficit of thirteen trillion that you're
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:40.040]  talking about uh... is a function of the treasury
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.240]  department which is separate from the fed reserve
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:47.880]  and but they do hide stuff like off the books
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:51.560]  in the treasury and they now say it's fourteen trail by the way
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:55.320]  or fourteen actually it's fourteen point three yeah but
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:00.280]  anyway uh... and then you have all of the programs that have been mandated
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:06.920]  and that brings it up to over a hundred trillion dollars a hundred and five
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:11.960]  trillion it gets that the figures and even the washington post
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:15.880]  even the washington post for fred admits last two months ago
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.960]  that it's six hundred trillion uh... in derivatives floating around worldwide
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:22.600]  many others estimate one point five quadrillion bob
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:27.320]  what's the total global uh... derivative hangover
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:35.720]  it's um... one point four quadrillion
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:41.400]  and it's got no home they're naked so there you have it fred fourteen
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:43.640]  point three trillion is a complete joke uh...
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:47.160]  just like they say unemployment nine point six twenty two plus
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:50.520]  uh... dave rob ever doesn't be our last calls from bob chapman then
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:55.320]  sure it works we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:03.400]  hi alex thanks for taking my call hey uh alex i appreciate uh
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:07.560]  hey thank you for you know waking me up about six months or so ago
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:11.960]  and uh really opening my eyes to this to this whole new world order situation
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:15.480]  and uh i gotta hand it to both of you guys alex and bob that you know i've
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:19.320]  been doing the research i got the documents have been trying to get to
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:22.840]  to see you know trying to get behind who's the you know the true culprits and
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:26.840]  criminals behind this economic disaster and all the new world order stuff
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:31.080]  and i agree with you guys 100 percent it's the jews
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:35.960]  it's the jews it's the jews you agree with us 100 percent it's the jews it's
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:40.680]  the jews it's the jews um i mean israel's certainly involved in a
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:43.720]  lot of corruption but all i mean the british government had these systems
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:46.600]  before the roth child's ever came along and
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:49.960]  i've i've just noticed with howl turner and others at the feds paid to go out
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:53.560]  and say it's the jews it's the jews that's actually done
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.400]  uh to demonize anybody that tries to criticize corruption by painting it as
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:00.840]  anti-semitic but we do criticize israel here we've been doing it
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:04.200]  earlier in the broadcast and i think it was probably somebody being sarcastic
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:09.160]  trying to claim we're anti-semitic uh but bob your take on that
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:13.080]  i i follow your lead i i agree with you completely
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:16.760]  uh there's all kinds of people involved in the conspiracy
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:20.120]  some of them are muslims they're christians they're catholics
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:24.840]  uh they're jews uh and they come from all walks of life
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:28.920]  but the feds want to make it exclusivity but the feds agents we keep
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:32.280]  catching impose as these great patriots who are going to tell us all what to
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:36.440]  believe and say and if you don't wear a nazi armband and hate jews and blame
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:41.400]  everything in the world including slipping on banana peels on jews then
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:47.640]  then you're you're bad but no this is a poison pill so that we can't defeat the
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:51.560]  new world order okay folks i mean let's say you know this guy's
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:54.360]  right and and and you know there's this jewish cabal the
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.000]  center of everything and there is a jewish mafia heavily involved in all
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.320]  this but but not completely let let's say those people were you know uh
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:05.000]  locked up in prison tomorrow and we're nazi germany you're you're gonna have
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.280]  the same corruption come right in okay this idea that evil can only come from
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:13.080]  one group evil comes from every group of people
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:20.440]  bob absolutely absolutely and trying to hang it on one group it just isn't
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:26.280]  right it's wrong and i've studied this going back
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:31.880]  two thousand years just like alex has i spent my whole life doing this and i
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:34.920]  can't tell you how many people who are involved
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:41.000]  almost all of them are not jewish and so it's a misnomer you you're chasing your
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.560]  tail you're wasting your time there's better things for you to do
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:49.160]  than blame it on one group of people well i'll say this it's on record
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:52.920]  that the israelis to make jews go to israel
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:56.360]  uh before israel existed one group of zionist
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:59.960]  would not let jews leave this is you know mainline books by jewish
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.400]  professors been written on this unless they paid millions of dollars to them
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:07.000]  and they can only go to israel and uh you know the same thing with george
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.160]  soros these are cold-blooded uh people and the jewish
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:16.840]  mafia has been caught over and over again in spain and iraq bombing jews
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:21.480]  to make them move to israel uh and and funding anti-semitic groups to
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:25.240]  persecute jews so they'll go to the jewish mafia for protection
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:28.200]  just like an italian model burned down a grocery store if you don't pay in
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:34.040]  protection it's the same thing bob absolutely yeah i've cracked the code
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:37.640]  on this and you know what we're not going to take your bait you understand
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:39.880]  that we're going to get jews woken up just like
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:42.120]  everybody else and have them fight the new world order
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:45.880]  i got a hurry now because that caller took too long uh let's talk real fast
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:48.520]  real quick question robin canada go ahead
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:53.800]  yeah i have a very general question it's about the on the topic of
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:58.200]  declassified government documents okay and my question is um
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:01.960]  you exposed an unbelievable amount of crime you know that have come out of
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:06.280]  these documents but these people why would they let these documents out
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:09.640]  okay because to get the national security state in 47 they agreed that
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:12.280]  they'd have to release them every 10 to 20 years
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:15.640]  and so that was the law and now they have tried and do
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.480]  not release a lot of things that's why most of stuff we get 20 years older
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.280]  uh and so uh i mean they admit northwood's real they admit all that is
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:27.400]  real because we still have some semblance of checks and balances appreciate
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:30.280]  your call bob Chapman
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:35.160]  any comments speechless no no i have nothing to add to that it's
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:38.760]  perfect okay real fast everton tennessee you're on the air quickly i gotta
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:42.600]  gotta go to uh steward rhodes via cell phone just got off a plane
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.840]  uh go ahead ever you're on the air with bob Chapman thank you god bless you too
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:52.520]  waking me up once you know a couple years ago i just had the question like
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:56.120]  are we still going to end up as a captive society
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:00.840]  and are we going to start to see like the the image of the market of beast
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:05.000]  worldwide ever that's not going to happen if you stand tall and take action
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.240]  we'll be given a reprieve bot like neneva but undoubtedly we're going into
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:13.720]  hell on earth if we don't all wake up and take action now bob Chapman
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:18.520]  i agree and i don't think that the people of the world never mind just
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:21.880]  americans are going to accept the cipher or
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:25.800]  uh chip or uh are something that's digital
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:29.080]  uh to keep all their wealth in one place
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:32.040]  so that the people who are in charge behind the scenes
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:37.560]  can steal it from us anything else ever well that they might just use this
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:42.920]  unemployment this unemployment system you know everybody's out of work and
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.200]  stuff oh they're already telling people with their food stamp card what they're
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:49.640]  allowed to eat you're absolutely right ever
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:52.360]  and i'm just worried about all this stuff that's happening
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:56.040]  and god thank for both of you doing a great job

[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:35.240]  you bet what a great guy bob Chapman okay going back to the issue that we
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:38.360]  covered uh at the beginning of the broadcast and
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:43.480]  we'll put that article uh up on the tv screen for prison
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:47.160]  planet dot tv viewers government sees this newborn baby over political
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.480]  beliefs of parents and uh we have the copy from cps it says the
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.760]  division became aware and confirmed that mr iris associated with a
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:58.040]  militia known as the oathkeepers and had purchased several different types of
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:01.400]  weapons including a rifle a month and a half before she was going to have the
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:04.680]  baby he had gone to have his wisdom teeth removed
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:08.280]  she was driving she has a concealed carry they were waiting six squad cars at
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:11.400]  their house this is racketeering they said where's the gun
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.280]  and they got out because they wanted the baby this is when they get up to a half
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:18.280]  a million for these kids uh blonde hair blew out babies top top money and i've
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:22.200]  found these networks in austin we had that state senator on who was
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:25.800]  exposing how they have quotas to grab the kids and of course they
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.080]  killed her execution style uh just a few months ago
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:32.120]  uh but uh the issue here is they were waiting
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:34.680]  and it was her concealed carry and they said we don't care the guns your
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:37.240]  husband he has an illegal concealed carry he's going to jail
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.920]  and they cited that when they took the baby and oathkeepers this family's under
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:44.200]  surveillance they were picked for this and i've seen articles where the
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:47.800]  southern prairie law center a d l are in the schools law enforcement
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:51.800]  and steward roge linked up at oathkeepers today countering violent extremism
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.080]  working group uh they now are officially merging southern
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:59.800]  prairie law center as the command group over the privatization of police chiefs
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:03.960]  school teachers you name it as part of a huge spy network similar to what we just
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:07.480]  saw uh two weeks ago in pennsylvania with the illegal
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:10.920]  operations of an israeli company through the state homeland security spying on
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:14.360]  members of the legislature and others steward roge joining us dealing with the
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.320]  kidnapping of this child uh the child now a political
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:20.760]  prisoner part of the new red terror in america the founder
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.120]  of oathkeepers a pear trooper ron paul's assistant
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:27.800]  what is it harvard or Yale uh law degree good to have you here with us
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:32.760]  steward roge you're doing good you've got the floor uh the
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:35.720]  secret police are now coming after our children
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:39.960]  well that's the that's the big picture um that's why the context has to be
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:43.720]  has to be taken into consideration in this case it's not just an isolated case
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:47.880]  or put it this way it's not one it's not what the big powers of the dhs want to
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:51.640]  be isolated i mean they're basically telling us they're going to infiltrate
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:55.640]  down to the very local level and the that that working group's recommendations
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:00.120]  include um utilizing childhood services and other social
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:04.680]  services and also mental health um as part of the local effort to
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:07.880]  you know quote unquote combat the violent extremism they're going to get
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:11.960]  into the schools and teach parents and teachers how to look for signs of
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:15.480]  violent extremism in the children it's just it's just ridiculous and what's
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:19.800]  and we have uh the ceo so the party law center sitting on his panel
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:23.880]  and helping to point the finger at that who the internal enemy is
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:26.840]  who are they going to point it at they've already told us you know you're
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:30.600]  on the list ron paul's on the list so balvin anybody who stands up for the
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:36.200]  constitution is going to be fingered as anyone who isn't a lawless dangerous
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.880]  to the children anyone who isn't a supporter of the lawless criminal
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:43.960]  globalist takeover right anyways i'm just gonna just gonna roll over and
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:47.640]  allow our public to be destroyed and that's the that's the big picture
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:51.640]  um narrow picture in this case um uh itself the reason why
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:57.720]  it's it's you know got our attention is that enumerated in the uh affidavit
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:01.000]  it's a big law that's both kind of accusation against the parents but two
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:05.640]  of them as you said one of them is is that uh the father associated with
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:10.040]  um a militia group known as the oath case no this is like the mayak this is like
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:14.200]  the mayak report this is the government brainwashing police to the point
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:17.880]  that they think they're doing god's work taking somebody's newborn baby
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:21.960]  because they call you a militia a and it wouldn't be bad if you were but you're
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:26.760]  not and and and so it just shows a total red-handed evidence of the secret
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:30.120]  police network well and they're turning things that are
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:35.720]  absolutely legal not illegal but part of your core right to the citizen i mean
[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:39.960]  political speeches is well established in constitutional law as the most
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:43.400]  important speech protected by the first amendment i mean and
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:46.520]  and there's a principle of chilling in speech it comes when
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:50.280]  ever you have a targeting of a person an application of law against them
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:53.960]  for their core political beliefs and expressions and association
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:57.560]  this is to the big problem here is that this is allowed to stand
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:02.440]  and they're allowed to start using um your association to lawful assembly and
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:07.080]  lawful association as criteria for taking your children imagine the
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:10.360]  chilling effect going to have on on a parent across america

[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.720]  but now it's happening they're politicizing that it was already a
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:56.440]  problem but now now it's being a corruption
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.200]  um is rampant for corruption and right for corruption and abuse of power
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:03.800]  but now it's being politicized and it's going to be politicized

[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:31.960]  the one that's going to happen to the rest of us and to the many

[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:49.320]  and religion are coming together and and so they're
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:52.520]  because they've got to be brazen and over the top with a
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.200]  illegal foreign intelligence takeover i mean it's happening folks we're being
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:59.240]  infiltrated and taken over right now they've got to act like they're the
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.360]  good guys high and mighty because what they're doing is so brazenly
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.240]  illegal as shown in pennsylvania
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:09.880]  well i mean that's because that's what they're doing and now it's becoming more
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:13.080]  more overt like i said in the right if i did on our website
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:16.600]  you know the mask is coming off and they're there you don't think you have a
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:19.960]  FOIA request anymore to find out that it turns out the
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.240]  microphone was written by someone by law center now it's in your face they're

[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:45.720]  news sources saying did you see the news and now i've confirmed it was on two
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:49.640]  news channels announcing the southern poverty law center in adl
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:52.520]  aren't are going to be in your schools they're going to be at your churches and
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:56.440]  i i went to the adl site and saw it and they're going to help you fight the
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:49:00.440]  terrorist the the right-wing terrorist i mean this
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:03.960]  again they're the infiltrators taking over and then they're calling us
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:07.800]  pointing out the infiltration they're saying we're terrorist i mean
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:11.400]  and and our day so veda our police chief in austin is in this report
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.200]  on this federal board and so is the uh social
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:18.680]  lesbian of uh by cutting the matter unfortunately
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:22.440]  where i would die schooling college uh what we have to do frankly
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:25.960]  is like kind of like a political scorched earth policy
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:30.360]  if your local officials cooperate with a politicized dhs
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  that is turned against law abiding constitution defending americans
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:37.640]  then they should be run out of office you cannot have
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:40.920]  um cooperation with something like that because like you said it's like a
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:45.080]  static it's a politicized um secret police network
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:49.400]  that's being used down in the local well listen listen steward i have found
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.560]  and i'm sure you've noticed this as well the reactor shaft on the death star
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.480]  this this pennsylvania situation where they've been caught
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:00.760]  the disgraced head is stepped down it's clearly illegal they're having
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:03.240]  investigations the state police are incriminately
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.840]  investigating that the senate is having hearings
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:10.520]  as we show a foreign israeli group contracted to spy on even members of
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:14.520]  the legislature we could bust this open like the adl did in the 90s
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:17.720]  you know getting criminally charged for infiltrating police departments we could
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:21.240]  bust open this whole situation
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:24.440]  close to where we can do i'm not really with you are
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:28.360]  um about that situation but whatever we can do the most important point is

[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.840]  afraid to step up right now because you're concerned about being
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:38.680]  fingered um and targeted that they'll come after you down the road

[02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:15.400]  which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:18.440]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our

[02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:06.920]  steward was asking me if they've set up a legal defense fund
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:12.360]  i just gave a mr irish address an email and
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:14.920]  steward's already had donations come into oath keepers
[02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:18.920]  but people trying to support but i've had them on so many times over the
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:22.520]  years and then i forget the names of the good groups that fight cps that are
[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:27.000]  expert lawyers you know he's a Yale constitutional
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:30.920]  lawyer and he could fight on the first amendment and stuff but we need to get
[02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:33.800]  those main groups and i mean i'll remember their names after the show
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:37.640]  and get it to mr irish but but finishing up steward we're talking
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:42.520]  during the break i mean this is really the secret police thought police
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:47.480]  saying if you're a member of the legislature and criticize high taxes
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:52.680]  israeli spies spy on you for the for the homeland security of the state i mean
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.360]  or the southern poverty law center comes in and spies on you and you know
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:00.760]  they and they take your baby because they're i mean how dumb are these cops
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.520]  that that the southern poverty law center comes in and tells them
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:08.040]  you know if they talk about ron paul or oath keepers get their baby
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:11.080]  i mean i mean i would think cops aren't this evil
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:15.560]  uh steward well and most of them are not but what they're doing though is a
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:18.040]  brainwashing and that's what we have to counter that
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:22.280]  with our own like deprogramming of the brainwashing they they want them to
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:25.640]  believe that you know essentially if you talk like
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:31.080]  callus jefferson you must be a terrorist is is is their bottom line and so and
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:35.000]  if you do anything that they don't like if you are a potential danger and
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.960]  potential cop killer so if you dare to associate
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:41.080]  um with with other police it's what's really amazing
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.080]  is that these police that have uh been brainwashing and thinking that
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:49.000]  if jonathan irish is associating with other police officers who stand for the
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.520]  constitution those are dangerous people which is it's just kind of hilarious
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:56.680]  the brother officers like like john surely they're in texas who's our state
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:02.120]  after president texas is a houston pd officer he is somehow a threat
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:05.240]  you know to these other officers and so that's that's the weird uh yeah but
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:08.760]  having police having police that aren't brainwashing to supporting the
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:11.960]  criminal banking takeover that is a danger to the criminals
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:15.800]  so but the criminals are are literally in there
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:21.000]  you know advising the police right and they're turning the world upside down
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:25.080]  again the other way they're making what's a good evil and what's evil good
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:27.640]  and they want the police to be brainwashed and thinking that this is
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:30.840]  this is the right way to do things this is why i started those keepers
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:35.320]  was to help counteract that brainwashing but it's getting to the point now
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:39.320]  where if you allow dhs to have its tentacles right down into your local
