[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Socialism is nothing but communism.
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  There's no such thing as socialism. America has always been the most socialist country in the world.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  We're definitely the most generous. Look at the people in this table.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Look at our backgrounds.
[00:48.000 --> 01:03.000]  Just think that in 1961, as a 13-year-old, by myself, in my way to Spain, I wasn't even coming here.
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  I arrived in this great country, and almost 60 years later, I'm sitting next to the President of the United States,
[01:11.000 --> 01:21.000]  talking about the American dream, the only country in the world, no other country in the world,
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  that you can start a business from the trunk of your car.
[01:26.000 --> 01:39.000]  And within a very few years, with hard work, commitment, and all the core values that we learn from this very culture of ours,
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  we can become very important to our future.
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  We can become those people who make the next generation better than the one before.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  This is the only country. Why do you think you had to close the borders?
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  Because everybody in the world wants to come over here.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  Nobody's ever forced to come over here.
[02:08.000 --> 02:20.000]  We come over here, in my case, because my parents chose that I would not be indoctrinated by the communist country,
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  by the totalitarian country, by the totalitarian regime.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  They don't educate children. Absolutely not.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  And this is something that we need to understand.
[02:40.000 --> 02:54.000]  What is happening in our backyard today, I experienced as an 11-year-old, I remember vividly,
[02:54.000 --> 03:09.000]  all the promises that a guy named Castro gave on how 99% of the people swallowed the pill.
[03:09.000 --> 03:21.000]  It took many years later, after I read somebody named Saul Alinsky, that I realized that all those people were nothing but useful idiots.
[03:21.000 --> 03:31.000]  I remember how he promised to the farmers, to the juajitos, that you're going to own the land.
[03:31.000 --> 03:44.000]  I remember all the promises that we hear today about free education and free healthcare and free land,
[03:44.000 --> 03:54.000]  and my God, no freedom. But he never said that until after he was in power,
[03:54.000 --> 04:04.000]  he got rid of all the police, got rid of all the military, been there for the last 60 years and counting.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  And he destroyed each and everyone who helped him.
[04:08.000 --> 04:15.000]  I'm going to leave you with one last thing. Never forget about my dad, who only had a sixth grade education,
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  but I think he was the greatest philosopher I ever met.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  He used to tell us how lucky he was because he was able to come from Spain to Cuba.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  And then he came from Cuba to the United States.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  And he saw me graduate from college and that was the biggest prize he ever had.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  And he said, don't lose this place because you're not going to be as lucky as me.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  Because if you lose this place, you have no place to go.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  So with that, please keep that in mind.
[04:48.000 --> 04:56.000]  And please, people explain that to our young people who are demonstrating out there.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  Don't be useful idiots.
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.000]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers do.
[05:04.000 --> 05:11.000]  They constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, you believe in that.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  It is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies in a post-human future.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  Talk about psychotic, talk about creepy, talk about crazy, but they need an event like COVID-19
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  to set the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G,
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.000]  That's why this is so evil.
[05:45.000 --> 05:53.000]  Their whole agenda for cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt,
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  getting rid of local government, think about all the facets of it, the censorship, the surveillance.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say,
[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[06:16.000 --> 06:41.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now, there is no government official here,
[06:45.000 --> 06:52.000]  but I'll say, that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  But I'll say, that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[07:10.000 --> 07:17.000]  came
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.160]  maybe we should go out on pennsylvania avenue
[07:32.160 --> 07:34.960]  uh... like these folks who chant cnn sucks and
[07:34.960 --> 07:38.840]  uh... fake news maybe we should go out all all journalists should go out on
[07:38.840 --> 07:45.840]  pennsylvania avenue and shant were not the enemy of the people
[07:53.480 --> 07:56.640]  we're not the enemy of the people were not the enemy of the people were not the
[07:56.640 --> 08:03.640]  enemy of the people
[08:05.240 --> 08:11.440]  this is cnn
[08:11.440 --> 08:14.560]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak
[08:14.560 --> 08:15.760]  you think just let me think
[08:15.760 --> 08:20.480]  even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will be on
[08:20.480 --> 08:21.040]  their way
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.320]  it's chancellor
[08:22.320 --> 08:24.080]  damn it
[08:24.080 --> 08:27.720]  because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation
[08:27.720 --> 08:30.640]  words will always retain their power
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.440]  words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen
[08:34.440 --> 08:37.960]  the annunciation of the truth
[08:37.960 --> 08:41.440]  there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that
[08:41.440 --> 08:44.520]  you decided sir you wanted it for a proof you told me every television in
[08:44.520 --> 08:45.080]  longer
[08:45.080 --> 08:47.160]  cruelty and injustice
[08:47.160 --> 08:48.960]  intolerance and depression
[08:48.960 --> 08:52.360]  and where once you have the freedom to object isn't a thing can speak as you saw
[08:52.360 --> 08:53.280]  fit
[08:53.280 --> 08:57.200]  you know i've seen some systems of surveillance cawessing your conformity
[08:57.200 --> 08:59.800]  insolvency in your sub machine cameras
[08:59.800 --> 09:01.320]  how did this happen
[09:01.320 --> 09:03.120]  most blame
[09:03.120 --> 09:06.080]  was certainly there are those who are more responsible than others
[09:06.080 --> 09:08.080]  they will be held accountable
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.800]  but again truth be told
[09:09.800 --> 09:11.720]  if you're looking for the guilty
[09:11.720 --> 09:14.680]  you need only look into a mirror
[09:14.680 --> 09:16.640]  i know why you did it
[09:16.640 --> 09:18.160]  i know you were afraid
[09:18.160 --> 09:19.480]  who wouldn't be
[09:19.480 --> 09:22.160]  war, terror, disease
[09:22.160 --> 09:26.400]  there were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and
[09:26.400 --> 09:28.600]  rob you of your common sense
[09:28.600 --> 09:30.400]  fear got the best of you
[09:30.400 --> 09:34.960]  and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor Adam Sattler
[09:34.960 --> 09:37.600]  he promised you order, he promised you peace
[09:37.600 --> 09:45.600]  and all he demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.920]  there is a war
[09:47.920 --> 09:49.520]  there is a war
[09:49.520 --> 09:51.440]  it's happening now
[09:51.440 --> 09:53.760]  we'll decide the fate of humanity
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.440]  the time to choose sides has come
[09:56.440 --> 09:58.240]  we are the resistance
[09:58.240 --> 10:05.240]  we are the info war
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.280]  welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live
[10:14.280 --> 10:15.800]  wednesday
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.440]  july 15th
[10:17.440 --> 10:19.960]  2020 transmission with one hundred
[10:19.960 --> 10:22.280]  and ten days out
[10:22.280 --> 10:25.080]  for the most important election in world history
[10:25.080 --> 10:26.600]  a referendum
[10:26.600 --> 10:28.720]  between a pro-human future
[10:28.720 --> 10:30.760]  and an anti-human future
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.280]  president trump has come out in the big town hall article
[10:34.280 --> 10:36.640]  saying the most dangerous thing facing
[10:36.640 --> 10:40.080]  his reelection is election fraud and he is a hundred percent
[10:40.080 --> 10:42.960]  on target but into that is the election meddling
[10:42.960 --> 10:45.320]  and the massive big tech censorship
[10:45.320 --> 10:47.320]  that is also going on
[10:47.320 --> 10:49.320]  we'll be looking at that today
[10:49.320 --> 10:52.520]  also with the marxist linus brainwashing
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.760]  that goes on in the colleges and in the popular culture
[10:55.760 --> 10:57.080]  has now hit
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.760]  boil
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.800]  and you have nick gannon i guess his claim to fame was being married to a
[11:02.800 --> 11:04.080]  pop star
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.280]  coming out putting out a standard anti-white
[11:08.280 --> 11:11.240]  anti-jew creed
[11:11.240 --> 11:14.600]  what you see in the left and that's what's so crazy about the leftist
[11:14.600 --> 11:19.160]  they'll call me a nazi and i'm not anti-israel or anti-jew
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.960]  but then their basic tenets are that jews are the most evil group out there
[11:23.960 --> 11:26.720]  it's very oxymoronical
[11:26.720 --> 11:29.800]  we're gonna be playing that clip coming up he's lost his job now
[11:29.800 --> 11:32.400]  you know i don't think you should lose his job i mean if people tune into it
[11:32.400 --> 11:35.440]  want to hear his bs he has a right to his podcast
[11:35.440 --> 11:38.240]  people subscribe to it i have a right to say he's wrong
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.000]  i mean don't let a racist black person speak for all the black people
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.960]  they don't like a racist white person speak for all the white people
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.400]  let them speak though
[11:46.400 --> 11:48.560]  we're big boys we can handle it
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.160]  but no see they then called
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.240]  mainline philosophers that are well-spoken and pro-human
[11:56.240 --> 12:00.360]  like stefan malinu a white supremacist as the adl said and ban him
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.840]  the left knows what it's doing
[12:02.840 --> 12:05.440]  it's a sophisticated dialectic we're gonna break it down and then this new
[12:05.440 --> 12:08.960]  footage has got everybody blown away
[12:08.960 --> 12:12.920]  black lives matter mainly white people go into a bar that's about half black
[12:12.920 --> 12:16.080]  half white like any big bar restaurant Dallas
[12:16.080 --> 12:18.560]  everybody get along great
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.240]  come in there
[12:20.240 --> 12:21.000]  and
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.400]  start a fight
[12:23.400 --> 12:26.920]  it's mainly white people screaming black lives matter at black people
[12:26.920 --> 12:29.800]  they're like hey man we're off work we're eating hamburgers and drinking beer
[12:29.800 --> 12:30.960]  leave us alone
[12:30.960 --> 12:33.200]  and boy it gets crazy from there on out
[12:33.200 --> 12:35.120]  because that's their job
[12:35.120 --> 12:38.960]  is to go start a riot we've got the documents three years ago
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.800]  from alexander soros's operation it's racketeering it's criminal
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.600]  she goes this doesn't make sense
[12:45.600 --> 12:47.640]  if they can get some white people
[12:47.640 --> 12:50.320]  to get up and kick some white people's asses that come
[12:50.320 --> 12:53.000]  stream at them and push them at their dinner table they're gonna say they're
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  white supremacist that's what they do
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.240]  they can jump in front of your car
[12:57.240 --> 13:00.040]  it doesn't matter if it's white people you get out and kick their ass they're
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.240]  gonna say
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.040]  that you're a white supremacist that's all they want is to say whites ran
[13:05.040 --> 13:06.080]  somebody over
[13:06.080 --> 13:07.760]  whites attack somebody
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.520]  she got all these college girls with their daisy dukes on and
[13:11.520 --> 13:13.840]  you know they're all in their war paint they should be out on a date or
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.520]  something or out you know for a jog but set out having fun
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.080]  they're out there
[13:19.080 --> 13:22.880]  with a bunch of marx's literally screaming at black people that black lives
[13:22.880 --> 13:24.320]  matter
[13:24.320 --> 13:28.080]  because the idiot followers of this are so stupid
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.120]  they're just ordered to attack and they go attack it's amazing
[13:32.120 --> 13:35.080]  just like they go into churches and get people's faces and go into a Catholic
[13:35.080 --> 13:39.080]  church and start screaming at somebody and it's a black woman
[13:39.080 --> 13:40.880]  carrying out the rosary
[13:40.880 --> 13:43.920]  and they scream at her because they're idiots
[13:43.920 --> 13:46.080]  they're crazy people
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.600]  and that's what communists are they're a bunch of moron college students
[13:49.600 --> 13:53.360]  promise that they're about to take over america and be given some big powerful
[13:53.360 --> 13:54.560]  position
[13:54.560 --> 13:55.920]  they're idiots
[13:55.920 --> 13:58.120]  just like that
[13:58.120 --> 14:01.680]  president's council meeting him with uh... victims of communism
[14:01.680 --> 14:03.520]  to the time of the crisis in venezuela
[14:03.520 --> 14:04.680]  and the man that escaped
[14:04.680 --> 14:07.560]  cuban when he was eleven laying that out and that's not what that man's saying
[14:07.560 --> 14:09.440]  that's the truth
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.960]  but you have to go through it first before you know what it's like well
[14:12.960 --> 14:17.080]  people are getting a big fact taste of it but first
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.000]  there's a big u n report out in the it's accurate that the world population
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.720]  is going to plunge almost half
[14:22.720 --> 14:25.560]  within fifty years in the cause of massive crisis
[14:25.560 --> 14:28.120]  and i say well that's fifty years fifty years goes by like that
[14:28.120 --> 14:30.560]  we're going to explain their larger plan out of this
[14:30.560 --> 14:34.600]  uh... also our own savannah hernandez was on fox news
[14:34.600 --> 14:35.960]  and uh...
[14:35.960 --> 14:38.280]  i kind of had to discover that for myself because
[14:38.280 --> 14:41.200]  anything we do we think of a small and not important so
[14:41.200 --> 14:43.640]  but but it's it's important she's doing a great job
[14:43.640 --> 14:45.600]  we're going to talk about that and play that
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.760]  it's posted on four dot com ruth better ginsburg is in the
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.240]  uh... hospital
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.280]  that bless her soul
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.000]  and then we're also going to get to the big fat enchilada when we return
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  look i've been saying for a long time covered nineteen is a giant sophisticated
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  takeover of society i mean there's a real virus at the heart of it but it's
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.960]  it's real powers it spreads really fast to affect everybody's everybody can be
[15:08.960 --> 15:10.320]  suspect in the bad guy
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.880]  and it's in fact it's a bill gates in the u n the w h o can own it
[15:13.880 --> 15:15.960]  that's now all confirmed
[15:15.960 --> 15:19.120]  but now it's really come out there's five new
[15:19.120 --> 15:21.880]  prestigious studies
[15:21.880 --> 15:24.280]  proving what we can look at the numbers and tell you you can look at the numbers
[15:24.280 --> 15:26.240]  and tell yourself
[15:26.240 --> 15:27.680]  it's got
[15:27.680 --> 15:31.920]  five times the death rate five times lower the death rate than the flu
[15:31.920 --> 15:34.920]  and that's most of that's with fake numbers people to die to something else
[15:34.920 --> 15:37.480]  to take those numbers out it it it's just
[15:37.480 --> 15:40.120]  very hard to die from coven nineteen
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.840]  he had to be super old a bunch of other conditions
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.680]  no vitamins or minerals and that'll kill you that in a hammer
[15:45.680 --> 15:48.480]  course the wind can blow and kill you if you don't have that
[15:48.480 --> 15:51.920]  people don't usually die starvation that i have complications from malnutrition
[15:51.920 --> 15:54.640]  and a lot of americans are malnourished is a crap all day
[15:54.640 --> 15:56.960]  we'll be right back stay with us
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.400]  much of the united states bureaucracy all of hollywood and most of our media is
[16:01.400 --> 16:03.640]  under international banking control
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.280]  the united nations was set up by the roth child's rocker fellers on record
[16:07.280 --> 16:10.240]  to carry out this operation now under the guise of
[16:10.240 --> 16:11.920]  medical security
[16:11.920 --> 16:14.800]  they're bringing us medical charity
[16:14.800 --> 16:15.760]  that we see
[16:15.760 --> 16:18.360]  much of the federal government the democrats the republicans
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.920]  all say except for trump and a few people
[16:20.920 --> 16:24.120]  that we need a nationwide force mask
[16:24.120 --> 16:25.000]  mandate
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.120]  to make everyone wear a mask
[16:27.120 --> 16:30.680]  even though just months ago we had the surgeon you know another say don't wear a
[16:30.680 --> 16:33.400]  mask it's all a fraud now they say you must
[16:33.400 --> 16:35.960]  wear a mask it's a sign of slavery
[16:35.960 --> 16:39.000]  it's a sign of submission i know you as listeners understand that
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.040]  we need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils and others to
[16:42.040 --> 16:43.160]  stand up and say
[16:43.160 --> 16:45.880]  we are sanctuary cities for reality
[16:45.880 --> 16:50.320]  and for state and local sovereignty against the globalist
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.640]  this isn't the federal government taking over it's the u n through the federal
[16:53.640 --> 16:56.800]  government and we as american citizens must say no
[16:56.800 --> 17:00.960]  the reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.200]  the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes
[17:05.200 --> 17:07.520]  we've gone over those purposes
[17:07.520 --> 17:09.640]  many times here on air
[17:09.640 --> 17:12.240]  the cashless society the surveillance system
[17:12.240 --> 17:15.760]  global government medical charity force inoculation
[17:15.760 --> 17:19.240]  the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[17:19.240 --> 17:21.200]  obsolete that we are
[17:21.200 --> 17:22.800]  non-essential
[17:22.800 --> 17:24.400]  as we begin to
[17:24.400 --> 17:27.280]  witness automation computers and robots
[17:27.280 --> 17:28.280]  take over
[17:28.280 --> 17:30.360]  the jobs that people once had
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.960]  by design
[17:31.960 --> 17:33.560]  this isn't like it's some
[17:33.560 --> 17:35.960]  advancement that we just fell into
[17:35.960 --> 17:38.280]  it's been pre-planned organized
[17:38.280 --> 17:39.160]  globally
[17:39.160 --> 17:41.360]  and it's extremely predatory
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.720]  and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[17:44.720 --> 17:46.080]  and regulations
[17:46.080 --> 17:48.200]  the central banks that control it all
[17:48.200 --> 17:53.080]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power
[17:53.080 --> 18:00.080]  this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[18:00.080 --> 18:29.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:29.080 --> 18:32.920]  and we are back live
[18:32.920 --> 18:34.920]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us
[18:34.920 --> 18:36.360]  i'm gonna get to the big
[18:36.360 --> 18:39.960]  covid-19 news next time because i'm having an airpiece problem
[18:39.960 --> 18:41.240]  i'm not trying to
[18:41.240 --> 18:43.640]  bait you here to like build suspense up or anything but i have to go to
[18:43.640 --> 18:45.160]  rebroadcast for a while here
[18:45.160 --> 18:50.440]  uh and then i am going to come back and hit the biggest news ever on covid-19
[18:50.440 --> 18:53.400]  and really the way forward and really exciting
[18:53.400 --> 18:55.480]  positive developments
[18:55.480 --> 18:57.960]  that have taken place that are just so
[18:57.960 --> 19:00.600]  incredibly good
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.120]  this is just really good news on so many fronts
[19:04.120 --> 19:07.320]  there's a lot of scary news as well but we're turning the corner
[19:07.320 --> 19:10.200]  in the general public not just here but around the world
[19:10.200 --> 19:13.880]  even australian national tv is coming out and saying this is an exaggerated
[19:13.880 --> 19:15.480]  thing to freak everybody out
[19:15.480 --> 19:18.280]  even cnn's coming out and saying that quomo
[19:18.280 --> 19:22.840]  is distracting from the horrible job he did in
[19:22.840 --> 19:27.080]  new york onto the florida governor because they know their listeners
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.080]  are totally pissed totally turning against him and aren't buying the bs
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.440]  so a lot of big stuff's happening we'll cover it coming up next time we got
[19:34.440 --> 19:37.640]  some really good special reports i was already gonna air
[19:37.640 --> 19:41.480]  uh that we need to go over number 10 on the list is the coronavirus
[19:41.480 --> 19:45.080]  shell game and it breaks down how this shell game
[19:45.080 --> 19:48.920]  hoax is really starting to come down around itself
[19:48.920 --> 19:53.400]  and we also have the next clip i'm gonna play at least part of it the trump
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.720]  dictator hoax here are those reports
[20:08.280 --> 20:12.440]  i came to us is because i delivered the message
[20:12.440 --> 20:17.960]  of the truth of kovey 19 if i tell it in hong kong the moment i start to tell
[20:17.960 --> 20:22.360]  it i will be disappeared and killed no one can hear me
[20:22.360 --> 20:26.600]  so for this purpose i like to go to us
[20:26.600 --> 20:30.040]  and tell the truth of the origins of kovey 19
[20:30.040 --> 20:33.800]  to the world to let people understand how terrible
[20:33.800 --> 20:39.160]  how dangerous it is this is nothing about politics this is a thing about
[20:39.160 --> 20:45.080]  visor all the human in the world can survive what are your sources telling
[20:45.080 --> 20:49.080]  you about chinese covering up the virus
[20:49.080 --> 20:53.080]  starting to have uh jesse uh doctors actually people associate with the
[20:53.080 --> 20:55.800]  hong kong lab and people associate with wuhan
[20:55.800 --> 21:00.520]  people associate with their entire biomedical and bioweapons uh
[21:00.520 --> 21:04.120]  defense industry start to defect and start to get information there's a
[21:04.120 --> 21:07.560]  massive whistleblower campaign in china right now
[21:07.560 --> 21:11.000]  our worst analysis of the enemy's operation is now confirmed to be
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.560]  exactly their attack profile i have a giant stack
[21:15.560 --> 21:19.000]  though of even mainstream news and government announcements of them
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.320]  covering their patuts their arses
[21:23.320 --> 21:28.600]  their rear ends their gluteus maximuses by admitting
[21:28.600 --> 21:33.000]  that it's all basically a complex john hobkins
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.520]  metric and who ran event 201 and the lockstep drill and all of it it's john
[21:38.520 --> 21:41.320]  hobkins john hobkins bill mullin against
[21:41.320 --> 21:44.760]  rockefeller foundation it's public that they give you the numbers
[21:44.760 --> 21:48.200]  they decide how the state's crunch the numbers everyone vows down and follows
[21:48.200 --> 21:52.120]  it your tv viewer look on screen you just type into google you know google
[21:52.120 --> 21:55.480]  puts out the number from john hobkins same thing the un puts out number of
[21:55.480 --> 21:58.920]  new covet cases and it says all-time record high
[21:58.920 --> 22:04.360]  62 000 new cases right there as of today now that's many many many many many
[22:04.360 --> 22:06.520]  times what the so-called previous record was now
[22:06.520 --> 22:10.600]  let's pull up on the same site from john hobkins the numbers
[22:10.600 --> 22:16.760]  on the number of dying every day from their peak of 3000 something with
[22:16.760 --> 22:22.840]  fake numbers to 729 you know how many people
[22:22.840 --> 22:28.600]  die per day on the globe 151 000 conservatively
[22:28.600 --> 22:32.840]  and large portion of that here in the united states let me die a year
[22:32.840 --> 22:38.600]  60 millions what's specced out for this year
[22:38.600 --> 22:43.240]  the numbers vary they can go show you a video one person getting over by car
[22:43.240 --> 22:46.040]  and you feel empathy and you care and you have sympathy
[22:46.040 --> 22:49.800]  but if you pull back and saw a million die would you care because the un admits
[22:49.800 --> 22:53.080]  millions have already starved to death during the lockdown worldwide
[22:53.080 --> 22:56.600]  130 plus million around the verge of starving
[22:56.600 --> 22:59.560]  with 30 plus million in the queue to starve right now but
[22:59.560 --> 23:03.480]  nobody's going to humanize them unless it's the un
[23:03.480 --> 23:07.880]  who engineered this collapse sucking money off those individuals it's keeping
[23:07.880 --> 23:10.840]  it for themselves using those they're killing
[23:10.840 --> 23:14.840]  to get good people to give money so they can siphon it off as they always do
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.000]  and forgive me for speaking bluntly but i'd like to lay out for you very clearly
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.160]  what the world is facing at this very moment at the same time while we're
[23:23.160 --> 23:27.320]  dealing with COVID-19 pandemic we're also on the brink
[23:27.320 --> 23:31.640]  of a hunger pandemic and my conversations with world leaders over the
[23:31.640 --> 23:35.880]  past many months before the coronavirus even became an issue
[23:35.880 --> 23:39.560]  i was saying that 2020 would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since
[23:39.560 --> 23:42.600]  world war two but those are the facts everything
[23:42.600 --> 23:52.120]  Fauci and the NIH of the un told us and the chikoms told us was a lie
[23:52.280 --> 23:56.200]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are back live i am your host Alex Jones on this

[24:12.520 --> 24:17.880]  and not be sabotaged by the election fraud and the next attempted coup
[24:17.880 --> 24:25.240]  that the deep state is preparing for him that is all coming up today briefly

[30:57.720 --> 31:00.760]  it but now when the papers say you're the
[31:00.760 --> 31:05.080]  devil you're satan you're the worst person on earth
[31:05.080 --> 31:09.800]  we've never had more success and since the establishment came out and said i
[31:09.800 --> 31:12.760]  was satan incarnate
[31:12.760 --> 31:15.880]  sure they may have cut us back on social media reached new people
[31:15.880 --> 31:20.280]  but you override them and spread the word but when it comes to congress
[31:20.280 --> 31:25.800]  and leaders in the united states or in brazil or in the
[31:25.800 --> 31:29.320]  uk or in germany or in russia or in japan
[31:29.320 --> 31:38.200]  or in south africa or in nigeria or in thailand or
[31:38.200 --> 31:42.920]  you name it people know this is the broadcast
[31:42.920 --> 31:47.000]  they're not supposed to tune into this is the broadcast it's evil this is the
[31:47.000 --> 32:03.720]  broadcast that's forbidden or the botan
[32:03.800 --> 32:07.480]  you know what's great the kind of social circles that don't want us
[32:07.480 --> 32:12.200]  we don't want you either thanks for showing us who you were
[32:12.200 --> 32:16.680]  what it's all about people think i go through a lot
[32:16.680 --> 32:21.720]  our founding fathers fought a military that had never been defeated
[32:21.720 --> 32:25.240]  with no military factories no infrastructure
[32:25.240 --> 32:29.560]  and they had over 70 of the public against them when the war started
[32:29.560 --> 32:33.000]  and only about three percent were involved to four percent
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.560]  in the war effort but they were focused and at the end of course
[32:37.560 --> 32:41.000]  almost everybody flipped and said they were with the colonies
[32:41.000 --> 32:45.640]  and the new country so i'm sitting here going through a lot they try to set me
[32:45.640 --> 32:49.160]  up they do a lot of bad things they harass me but
[32:49.160 --> 32:54.040]  i'm doing it from an air-conditioned studio i'm a wimp compared to the guys
[32:54.040 --> 32:57.800]  that hauled those guns off taekwondo roga
[32:57.800 --> 33:01.800]  and towards washington those men for days in the freezing cold marching to the
[33:01.800 --> 33:06.040]  night to take on the Hessians at Trenton
[33:06.040 --> 33:09.240]  now i'm sure down the road it's going to get a little rougher and
[33:09.240 --> 33:14.040]  we'll get to try to measure up i don't want to but don't worry you're all
[33:14.040 --> 33:18.520]  going to get to measure up because the time of sitting around the time of
[33:18.520 --> 33:23.240]  playing games is over we ran out the gas tank
[33:23.240 --> 33:27.560]  that our forebearers put in there for us we've ran through the reserves
[33:27.560 --> 33:31.560]  we've hit the bottom and now it's going to be up to us
[33:31.560 --> 33:34.280]  and i'll be honest with you i kind of like it i don't like the evil i don't
[33:34.280 --> 33:37.160]  like the devil worshipers the pedophiles the stuff they're doing
[33:37.160 --> 33:40.440]  but all you candy asses and i'm not talking to our audience i'm talking to
[33:40.440 --> 33:44.120]  people turning in to think this show's funny you're going to wish you'd have
[33:44.120 --> 33:47.400]  done something earlier when you had a chance
[33:47.400 --> 33:50.440]  because now you're going to get to go through what cubans went through and
[33:50.440 --> 33:53.160]  venezuelans went through and russians went through
[33:53.160 --> 33:56.520]  and chinese went through and koreans went through
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.760]  and americans went through before us you sit there living off other men's
[34:00.760 --> 34:03.880]  blood sweat and tears and the women that gave everything they had to support
[34:03.880 --> 34:06.360]  their families and you piss all over something
[34:06.360 --> 34:09.240]  that's a great idea that's delivered more freedom than any other country in
[34:09.240 --> 34:12.920]  the world you are literally begging the fates to
[34:12.920 --> 34:16.280]  destroy you
[34:16.280 --> 34:20.840]  let's hit it right now here's the good news
[34:20.840 --> 34:25.880]  i go out in public and i talk to basically everybody
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.320]  and folks are wearing the stupid mask and they're more pissed than ever and
[34:31.320 --> 34:35.800]  almost everyone i talk to says i know it's a fraud i know it's a scam
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.440]  they always say less than the common flu
[34:40.440 --> 34:44.920]  but they say what do you do and that's a good question
[34:44.920 --> 34:49.000]  when your leaders are bought off and paid off
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.640]  well you support the police and the sheriffs saying we're not going to
[34:51.640 --> 34:54.760]  enforce this crap and you just keep putting the info out to other people
[34:54.760 --> 34:58.840]  that aren't aware of how it's a scam and you keep exposing it
[34:58.840 --> 35:01.800]  and it's coming out you got state reps and others all over the country going
[35:01.800 --> 35:09.720]  wait a minute not just florida but texas and arizona it's all the red states
[35:09.720 --> 35:14.040]  have the globalist operatives in the hospitals running the un modeled
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.720]  that's who's in command so they're able to run the fraud from a centralized
[35:17.720 --> 35:21.720]  position saying that people
[35:21.880 --> 35:25.480]  that haven't even been tested have covered 19 by some quote
[35:25.480 --> 35:31.400]  complex metric complex metric means a magician's trick
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.880]  and again i was watching sky television that came up in my feet on youtube this
[35:35.880 --> 35:39.160]  morning from a month ago so i followed it up and found out
[35:39.160 --> 35:42.040]  it's all over australian tv that it's a hoax
[35:42.040 --> 35:45.320]  they're counting people that have cancer and heart disease is
[35:45.320 --> 35:50.360]  covered 19 and they said oh a 30 year old died and it turned out he had cancer
[35:50.360 --> 35:55.320]  and he died of cancer not covered 19 oh a one year old died yeah the baby had
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.720]  holes in its heart they tested the baby when it died and said it had covered 19
[35:59.720 --> 36:03.720]  papayas have covered 19 dogs have it goats have it
[36:03.720 --> 36:09.320]  hell easter bunnies have it it's like santa claus folks it doesn't exist but
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.720]  childlike brains believe in it i mean there's a real virus
[36:13.720 --> 36:18.920]  it's man-made so the corporations can own it and so everybody gets infected
[36:18.920 --> 36:22.360]  with it so you're all guilty and so they
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.240]  can save you with a vaccine they're marking you
[36:27.240 --> 36:31.240]  digitally genetically with a virus and they got a vaccine that didn't even a
[36:31.240 --> 36:34.360]  vaccine that goes in and reprograms your cells
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.880]  at the cellular level taking control of the nucleus
[36:37.880 --> 36:41.960]  and the mitochondria that's called cancer folks
[36:41.960 --> 36:45.320]  that's not putting something in your body and white blood cells learn what it is
[36:45.320 --> 36:48.120]  t lymphocytes and then go try and the other cells to fight it
[36:48.120 --> 36:51.880]  that's learned immunity it's a real science it's got side effects
[36:51.880 --> 36:55.320]  and they like to trojan horse stuff in the vaccine that's the problem
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.320]  they go oh you don't believe in science no we don't know all about it
[36:59.320 --> 37:03.960]  like chemotherapy or radiation therapy we know how it works it's also dangerous
[37:03.960 --> 37:07.480]  but now you've got the new vaccines that the stock market's up on
[37:07.480 --> 37:13.080]  that aren't vaccines it goes in with basically a nano tech that's we want
[37:13.080 --> 37:15.880]  boris johnson's calling it because it's engineered virus
[37:15.880 --> 37:21.800]  and it reprograms your damn cells you think that's safe
[37:21.800 --> 37:25.960]  that's so super advanced no one's able to track the criminal activity of what it
[37:25.960 --> 37:30.280]  really does because only the top corporations even know what's going on
[37:30.280 --> 37:33.400]  and that's where jeffrey eppstein came in blackmailing everybody
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.760]  the top scientists to make sure they didn't expose it that's why there's
[37:36.760 --> 37:40.200]  thousands of top virologists from all over the world
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.240]  murdered chopped up shot killed run over there's over a hundred of them killed in
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.280]  texas and a lot of times they torture him to death
[37:50.280 --> 37:53.320]  i read the police reports they go in these houses barely get any attention
[37:53.320 --> 37:56.360]  there's pentagrams carved in them they're intestines are hanging off the
[37:56.360 --> 38:01.800]  ceiling fans that yeah virginia texas you name it they
[38:01.800 --> 38:05.880]  gut them they send satanists to kill them whacked out on all sorts of crazy
[38:05.880 --> 38:08.520]  drugs but that's they activate these sleeper cells
[38:08.520 --> 38:11.640]  you know satanism is just a form of mind control you know that right
[38:11.640 --> 38:15.640]  so when we come back because i want to really get into this with some detail
[38:15.640 --> 38:19.080]  the goodness let me show you these headlines first

[40:12.120 --> 40:16.680]  the covet covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them

[40:54.280 --> 40:57.720]  a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to
[40:57.720 --> 41:01.320]  those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the
[41:01.320 --> 41:06.040]  tracking of cell phones how programmed master computers would
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.360]  manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.400]  large groups of human movements and activities but even
[41:13.400 --> 41:16.360]  predict what individuals would do and then once you can predict what
[41:16.360 --> 41:21.160]  individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli through the ai
[41:21.160 --> 41:25.480]  systems through the computers through digital billboards through face scanning
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.160]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.200]  you wanted to but when we cover that the media would
[41:32.200 --> 41:35.720]  attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory
[41:35.720 --> 41:39.480]  even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents
[41:39.480 --> 41:43.320]  well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are
[41:43.320 --> 41:46.360]  setting up this control system to make humans obsolete
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.040]  and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier
[41:50.040 --> 41:55.880]  than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now
[41:55.880 --> 42:00.120]  as men age they often experience a slowdown

[44:53.240 --> 44:57.720]  okay let's lay it out it is so positive that we told you a few months ago that
[44:57.720 --> 45:02.440]  trump was looking to sideline Fauci and i i told you he'd sideline Fauci
[45:02.440 --> 45:09.560]  and then about a week later you saw that begin to happen
[45:09.560 --> 45:12.280]  there's a way you get through to trump as the way tucker carlson gets through to
[45:12.280 --> 45:14.600]  him and i'm going to talk about this with jones galson today and get his
[45:14.600 --> 45:17.160]  advice because he pointed this out four years ago
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.960]  before trump was even elected that trump does not
[45:21.960 --> 45:27.080]  respond to groveling and he doesn't respond to people attacking him falsely
[45:27.080 --> 45:31.240]  but if he thinks you really have america's interest in his interest in
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.800]  you he does not like you kissing his ass so that's why i didn't understand why
[45:35.800 --> 45:38.760]  they were so upset when i would talk to trump because i'd give him real data
[45:38.760 --> 45:42.280]  and i'd talk to him squarely i'd say listen sir you're very important and very
[45:42.280 --> 45:45.240]  we're blessed to have you for my future and your future my children i need you
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.120]  just listen to me i don't need you to tell me because you know he just calls
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.360]  people up and pats them on the head and i said don't call me anymore unless
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.520]  you want to kick them out of afghanistan and make sure we get the rare earth
[45:56.520 --> 45:59.960]  minerals i'm not there to act tough to the president
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.280]  i'm not there to act like i'm got bravada it's not like that i'm a really
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.040]  nice person around women children other men i'm not trying to act powerful
[46:08.040 --> 46:11.960]  this is an important person in the world and we're under total attack and if i
[46:11.960 --> 46:17.080]  get a chance to talk to trump i'm not gonna sit there and play games
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.160]  and all of you should be the same way when you're at one of his rallies and
[46:21.160 --> 46:23.800]  by the way that's why they want the rally stop not just because he gets
[46:23.800 --> 46:26.680]  attention not just because they're coverage
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.080]  he has the secret service take everything people hand him
[46:31.080 --> 46:36.120]  and he has up to 10 boxes of it when he flies overseas or back to dc and he
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.080]  looks at all of it
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.280]  he answers the switchboards in the middle of the night
[46:44.280 --> 46:48.920]  the guy's a maniac but he goes back to his dad and their and their buildings is
[46:48.920 --> 46:52.360]  they listen to the people and they respect that the most
[46:52.360 --> 46:55.720]  and it's not some kiss your ass thing either it's like they know
[46:55.720 --> 46:58.440]  dear to the ground the street the people's what matters
[46:58.440 --> 47:02.440]  they want to know what's going on any successful business knows that when
[47:02.440 --> 47:05.480]  he's successful president should be like that
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.800]  and so you've gotten the message of trump i've gotten the message to fire
[47:09.800 --> 47:13.640]  falchi and then to absolutely first sidelines so
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.160]  he doesn't get power up front first diminish him
[47:17.160 --> 47:20.600]  then politically destroy him then fire him then indict him
[47:20.600 --> 47:23.640]  and i can tell you that's the way this is going because the whole house of cards
[47:23.640 --> 47:27.320]  has to come down falchi is involved in insider trading
[47:27.320 --> 47:31.160]  falchi is involved with the vaccines falchi has the patents along with
[47:31.160 --> 47:34.840]  bill gates to most of the vaccines this is on record
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.320]  they set up the wuhan lab they created the virus that's literally mainstream
[47:39.320 --> 47:44.360]  news we first told you about it and so these criminals
[47:44.360 --> 47:47.480]  aren't going to ever stop until they are on
[47:47.480 --> 47:51.720]  the defense we need them going backwards on their heels
[47:51.720 --> 47:56.600]  not engaging us forwardly with 110 days left trump gets this
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.040]  and is taking the gloves off on censorship the gloves off an election
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.160]  fraud the gloves off on china the gloves off on
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.400]  coronavirus hoax the gloves off on every damn bit of it
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.080]  because if he didn't go okay we're really worried it's a terrible thing the
[48:11.080 --> 48:14.360]  governors and the mayors and the blue states and the u.n and the media
[48:14.360 --> 48:17.800]  we're going to gang up create the fake death numbers from regular deaths
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.440]  and pneumonia and flu and say that he was bad
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.400]  so we had to at least take control of it and they figured out he took control of
[48:27.400 --> 48:30.040]  it so they they did the reclosing even quicker they were
[48:30.040 --> 48:35.000]  planning to do it in september but because trump was already
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.440]  reopening things they saw them the economy bounced back so fast they
[48:38.440 --> 48:41.160]  panicked and they put the clamps on too quick
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.960]  so again providence is on our side it's blowing up in their face
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.480]  and so when you see the reports out there that oh trump won't let scientists
[48:49.480 --> 48:53.080]  and doctors look at this he took control the numbers no
[48:53.080 --> 48:58.600]  he's taking control of the raw numbers and as statisticians looking at it
[48:58.600 --> 49:02.520]  because he knows they're counting for every one person with covid-15 extra
[49:02.520 --> 49:05.960]  he knows that people go in who aren't even tested but if they have the sniffles
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.080]  they're counted as covid this is official and so trump is preparing
[49:11.080 --> 49:18.280]  to come out and totally discredit these monsters
[49:18.280 --> 49:21.960]  that's why he keeps the enemy closer like oh vaccine yeah hope
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.720]  oh yeah oh bill gates has got that oh bill you're our buddy
[49:25.720 --> 49:29.480]  before he drops a hammer on them then you'll see all the stories about how
[49:29.480 --> 49:33.720]  insider trading how they on the vaccines how they covered up vaccine damage
[49:33.720 --> 49:37.560]  how they covered up the vaccine trials trump is letting them stick their hand
[49:37.560 --> 49:41.960]  down the rattlesnake hole
[49:41.960 --> 49:45.080]  and that's what this broadcast serves as a purpose is the revelation of the
[49:45.080 --> 49:48.680]  method how we're doing this and we are some potico I tell you
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.000]  more and more it's just that absolutely enrages the establishment so
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.920]  here's the news headlines coronavirus hospital data will now be sent to trump
[49:56.920 --> 50:01.400]  administration instead of cdc now that's an msm and cnn spin it's really
[50:01.400 --> 50:04.760]  just that he's gonna be overseeing it now and not letting Fauci put out known
[50:04.760 --> 50:08.600]  fraud public disconnect from covid 19 reality
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.040]  worries experts oh really 2.5 million dead 2.2 million dead it's really 140
[50:14.040 --> 50:17.160]  thousand those are skewed numbers you're the disconnect
[50:17.160 --> 50:20.920]  you're the false positive test you're the ones counting people that died of
[50:20.920 --> 50:27.240]  gunshot wounds and cancer but again oh you are delusional you're
[50:27.240 --> 50:30.680]  idiots and another thing is there was some really bad pneumonia is going around
[50:30.680 --> 50:33.480]  this year last year this was the worst year since
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.120]  my uncle's two uncles and a cousin died at the same family ranch three different
[50:38.120 --> 50:42.760]  houses in a month there was no coverage of it
[50:42.760 --> 50:46.760]  the hospital did have body bags piled up in
[50:46.760 --> 50:51.080]  palestine texas it's name of the town palestine
[50:51.080 --> 50:55.560]  rednecks called palestine but when there's a real epidemic you're not going
[50:55.560 --> 50:58.520]  to hear about it boys and girls they're going to cover that up
[50:58.520 --> 51:01.640]  this is there are real pneumonia is out there and if you don't have zinc vitamin
[51:01.640 --> 51:06.760]  d3 or c you are defenseless if you got it you're in like flin
[51:06.760 --> 51:10.520]  but you read this oh the public are a bunch of idiots they're not listening
[51:10.520 --> 51:14.680]  to the the worst case spike ever oh without the deaths
[51:14.680 --> 51:18.680]  because remember the u n told us it was a four percent death rate the 3.5
[51:18.680 --> 51:22.040]  percent death rate now three percent death rate the two percent death rate
[51:22.040 --> 51:25.560]  no one percent death rate and now it's way down there
[51:25.560 --> 51:30.120]  three or four times less deadly than flu and that's with all the fake death
[51:30.120 --> 51:33.000]  numbers but again it's a real virus to spread
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.480]  so you can be found guilty by contact tracers
[51:37.480 --> 51:40.360]  and then they can release new versions of the kind of virus
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.280]  that are deadly and now you're starting to see those announcements in china
[51:44.280 --> 51:48.360]  oh yeah this is a beta test to make sure you're going to stay
[51:48.360 --> 51:52.520]  locked down and won't get out of line when they release a real bio weapon
[51:52.520 --> 51:56.280]  that's why this whole project must fail if you want to still be living in five
[51:56.280 --> 51:59.240]  years and believe me folks i don't say stuff to shock you
[51:59.240 --> 52:04.280]  i say what i really believe and what i know so you better listen to me
[52:04.280 --> 52:07.160]  i want to keep living i want my children to keep living
[52:07.160 --> 52:10.600]  but i'm going to tell the global of something
[52:10.600 --> 52:14.200]  you release the next big weapon and you really kill millions of people
[52:14.200 --> 52:17.800]  we know bill gates came out said oh the bad one's coming and this was just a
[52:17.800 --> 52:21.240]  drill yeah we called that everybody saw me call that i know you
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.800]  i'm inside your head i got your number buddy boy
[52:25.800 --> 52:31.800]  the people of the world are going to hold you responsible so you better stop
[52:31.800 --> 52:35.320]  right now but just like hitler he didn't really want to set up a world
[52:35.320 --> 52:39.000]  government and all that he's going to kill people
[52:39.640 --> 52:43.560]  so while he was losing the war it could have stopped killing people
[52:43.560 --> 52:48.200]  and probably won the war he just accelerated the killing
[52:48.840 --> 52:54.360]  because it was all just an exercise in killing the journey was the destination
[52:54.360 --> 52:57.720]  continuing jake tapper stunner cnn hack slams
[52:57.720 --> 53:02.680]  governor quomo for bragging and crowing on late night tv about how he did a
[53:02.680 --> 53:05.480]  great job we did the worst job ever that's coming up
[53:05.480 --> 53:09.880]  stunning texas coronavirus numbers show cuba 19 less lethal than the last two
[53:09.880 --> 53:12.760]  flu season with the state of texas his own numbers i love
[53:12.760 --> 53:18.200]  being scooped by gateway pundit they hired a phd statistician so did we
[53:18.200 --> 53:22.040]  i've got joe hoffton yesterday saying oh he's like yeah we got a phd
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.040]  statistician we're about to release it texas numbers new york new jersey
[53:26.040 --> 53:29.880]  numbers have literally got a statistician in texas
[53:29.880 --> 53:33.960]  hired doing it right now and i was glad to be
[53:33.960 --> 53:37.000]  scooped they just did it to show the same numbers
[53:37.000 --> 53:40.520]  it's way way way weaker than the flu and remember they're adding everybody that
[53:40.520 --> 53:43.800]  died of something else to that and snake and tubes down your throat and blowing
[53:43.800 --> 53:48.120]  your lungs out wow here's another one exclusive
[53:48.120 --> 53:52.840]  coronavirus study confirms with exception in new york new jersey
[53:52.840 --> 53:56.360]  overall mortality not much different than bad flu season
[53:56.360 --> 53:59.400]  and again that's using fake numbers because they used dead from other stuff
[53:59.400 --> 54:03.720]  added but meanwhile modera which the nih and
[54:03.720 --> 54:07.480]  fouchie own the patent on for the vaccines
[54:07.480 --> 54:11.720]  look it up shares jump as much as 16 for company says
[54:11.720 --> 54:15.800]  it's coronavirus vaccine trial produced robust immune response oh
[54:15.800 --> 54:19.080]  people had a really bad immune response but now you're telling us that i didn't
[54:19.080 --> 54:21.880]  protect us from it see everything's upside down world an
[54:21.880 --> 54:25.480]  experimental covid-19 vaccine being pushed through
[54:25.480 --> 54:29.720]  development will require more than one injection oh how
[54:29.720 --> 54:33.880]  wonderful meanwhile the left has all these ridiculous
[54:33.880 --> 54:37.640]  coronavirus demands that are political before they let people reopen the
[54:37.640 --> 54:40.280]  states it was always about a communist takeover and now they
[54:40.280 --> 54:43.800]  admitted as stay with us our number two straight ahead
[54:43.800 --> 54:47.960]  americans have had freedom for so long and most americans
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.280]  were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history
[54:52.280 --> 54:56.040]  that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the american
[54:56.040 --> 54:59.880]  way truth justice due process the right to self-defense
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.240]  private property because we've had it so long we just think that's how the rest
[55:03.240 --> 55:07.160]  of the world is ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social contract
[55:07.160 --> 55:11.560]  that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity
[55:11.560 --> 55:14.680]  and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.360]  is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world
[55:18.360 --> 55:21.480]  that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalists
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.160]  who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold
[55:25.160 --> 55:30.200]  and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate and
[55:30.200 --> 55:34.680]  command even luck enough to stay alive and that's what covid-19 is
[55:34.680 --> 55:40.040]  a global un revolution against free humanity against your family against
[55:40.040 --> 55:42.840]  prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and fight you deserve
[55:42.840 --> 55:45.160]  what you get
[55:45.160 --> 55:49.000]  so i was taking care of an errand this morning and i was even closer downtown
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.360]  but i was parked on the side street going to this business
[55:52.360 --> 55:55.640]  when i came back out i saw what looked like two
[55:55.640 --> 56:00.440]  asian folks probably chinese walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up
[56:00.440 --> 56:03.880]  ahead of me and here i am parked a truck with the windows up
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.240]  and the woman stops and points at me so they stop
[56:07.240 --> 56:10.200]  and they wait while i'm inside my truck truck started
[56:10.200 --> 56:14.120]  and they sit there and stretch keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[56:14.120 --> 56:17.720]  like they're waiting for me to go
[56:17.720 --> 56:22.920]  because i'm not wearing a mask inside my car and so then i just sat there so they
[56:22.920 --> 56:27.080]  acted angry and walked past me i almost shot a video of it on my
[56:27.080 --> 56:29.800]  phone but everybody sees this stuff happening
[56:29.800 --> 56:33.320]  everywhere this is mental illness people are pulling guns on folks that aren't
[56:33.320 --> 56:37.640]  wearing masks this is all cult programming this is all about submitting
[56:37.640 --> 56:41.880]  we cannot submit to this un brainwashing it's all a giant fraud
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.440]  we must expose the fraud or become slaves to it
[56:46.440 --> 57:02.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.720]  on speaking of new york new york's democratic governor andrew qualmo
[57:13.720 --> 57:17.400]  seems to be on something of a victory tour congratulating the state and himself
[57:17.400 --> 57:21.080]  for defeating the virus even selling this poster
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.840]  which shows his state getting over the mountain by bringing down the curve
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.680]  during the 111 days of hell as the governor put it the poster includes
[57:28.680 --> 57:32.840]  references to his daughters and a boyfriend little inside jokes there
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.520]  are no illustrations however of the more than 32 000
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.040]  dead new yorkers the highest death toll by far
[57:40.040 --> 57:43.320]  of any state no rendering on that poster of criticism that
[57:43.320 --> 57:46.360]  governor qualmo ignored warnings no depiction of the study
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.520]  that he could have saved thousands of lives had he and mayor de blasio acted
[57:50.520 --> 57:53.000]  sooner no painting there on the poster of his
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.440]  since rescinded order that nursing homes take
[57:56.440 --> 58:02.520]  all infected patients in here is what governor qualmo had to say yesterday
[58:02.520 --> 58:07.160]  what we went through and what we did was historic
[58:07.160 --> 58:12.680]  because we did tame the beast we did turn the corner we did
[58:12.680 --> 58:18.040]  plateau that mountain we did and then we came down the other side
[58:18.040 --> 58:22.360]  and they will be talking about what we did how we killed all those
[58:22.360 --> 58:24.840]  to come
[58:25.640 --> 58:29.080]  here to discuss this and more as cnn chief medical correspondent dr sanjay
[58:29.080 --> 58:32.120]  gupta and sanjay look i know a lot of new yorkers are happy that the
[58:32.120 --> 58:35.960]  infection numbers are down and you know we all hope that they stay
[58:35.960 --> 58:39.800]  down but let's begin here this is revisionism and a lot of the crowing
[58:39.800 --> 58:43.160]  and governor qualmo going on late night is is offending a lot of new yorkers
[58:43.160 --> 58:45.880]  given the fact that this is the highest death toll of
[58:45.880 --> 58:49.400]  any state more than 32 000 dead the next closest is
[58:49.400 --> 58:53.640]  new jersey with 17 000 are people going to be talking about what governor qualmo
[58:53.640 --> 58:58.120]  did for decades to come in the way he hopes
[58:58.120 --> 59:02.840]  uh i uh unfortunately i don't think so jake i mean i think we're very early
[59:02.840 --> 59:07.240]  days in this you know we're looking at the first few pages of the history books
[59:07.240 --> 59:09.160]  and i think there's a lot more to be written
[59:09.160 --> 59:12.920]  i'm a little surprised by that poster i got to tell you because
[59:12.920 --> 59:15.960]  you know i think if anything that's what this virus has taught us is that we
[59:15.960 --> 59:20.360]  need to have a significant amount of humility this virus surprises us over
[59:20.360 --> 59:24.120]  and over again there's no place in the country that's not vulnerable and i
[59:24.120 --> 59:27.240]  think that we should have learned i think we have learned that victory laps
[59:27.240 --> 59:31.480]  are not the thing to be doing that's right because you'll never defeat
[59:31.480 --> 59:34.840]  the virus the un will inject you it'll never go away
[59:34.840 --> 59:38.280]  this is an invisible enemy that you just can't stop in it keep surprising
[59:38.280 --> 59:42.600]  us because it's a load of bull so you see them criticizing qualmo but not for
[59:42.600 --> 59:46.600]  the right reason qualmo dared to try to create hope
[59:46.600 --> 59:53.800]  qualmo tried to say oh we're having you know nine times less deaths than we did
[59:53.800 --> 59:56.760]  because the doctors now know that intubating somebody that has an auto
[59:56.760 --> 59:59.400]  immune response kills them people are now taking zinc
[59:59.400 --> 1:00:03.160]  they're now taking hydroxychloroquine so you're having trouble killing people
[1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:06.440]  and and the folks aren't letting you send sick people to nursing homes to kill
[1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:10.120]  more folks so because we stopped the mass murder and because qualmo stopped the
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:12.760]  mass murder he's now can be thrown to the bus
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:19.640]  by sanjay gupta and jake tapper who had bill gates on
[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:23.000]  and grobbled to him when bill gates says it's never ending remember for reed
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.640]  zikaria said this will never end and gates goes that's right
[1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:29.720]  we never reopen we never go to baseball games we never shake hands again
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:36.520]  fouts he said what a cult and it's all based on 2.5 million dead when it's 140
[1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:40.280]  thousand dead most of those fake numbers people that died about the stuff
[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:44.520]  but we won't call these frauds out so now conservatives are like man
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.240]  jake tapper really handed it to qualmo like it's
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:51.400]  political like how dare him attack the santas he's had more deaths
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:56.280]  the whole thing's a giant fraud and cnn wants to keep it going
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:00.200]  yeah this is a big book you know the last six
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:03.880]  seven months is only a couple pages i mean this goes on for decades see
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.200]  and by the way first they were saying oh it's just 15 days i said it'll be years
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:11.320]  and they go it'll be months i said it'll be decades
[1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:14.920]  and now they're like humans can't even live in this environment
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:17.480]  we've got a merge with machines and you're getting rid of our bodies wall
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  street journal new york times humans are obsolete kill all the humans

[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:42.360]  but trump is now making the right moves and i just it's a godsend
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:45.960]  there's not just evil in the universe there's good in the universe and
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:50.600]  trump is taking control of the cub in nineteen hoax preparing preparing to
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:54.440]  savage fouchy and that is the only course he must be
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:59.320]  destroyed and i don't take pleasure crushing that garden gnome
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:03.240]  it just he's bad he's evil he's a fraud he's been there for 40 plus years
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:07.400]  he oversaw all these scams worldwide depopulation forced inoculation
[1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:10.760]  he's heavily invested in all the major vaccines they're causing major health
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:13.160]  problems he's he's been given liability protection
[1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:17.720]  he is a footstool of the rockefeller foundation and bill emerald negates
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:21.000]  foundation and he's a liar and he's been wrong
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.360]  on purpose purposely fraudulently on every front
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:32.760]  and so i'm very blessed to still be alive and to still be on air

[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:40.440]  and spreading the word that we could all still be on air at this critical time
[1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:45.080]  we were supposed to already be off air and every day i'm alive is a good day
[1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:48.840]  but i tell you they could kill me tomorrow and i would do it all over again
[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:52.680]  because it's been amazing knowing you all it's been amazing going this far
[1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:55.720]  having this big an effect and everything else from here on out is

[1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:04.680]  humanity i genuinely love people white people brown
[1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:08.440]  people pink people black people that can see your soul
[1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:12.440]  when you love god now when you love the enemy i don't like you
[1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:15.000]  you can be black you can be white i can see you
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:18.920]  i see how you walk how your eyes look who you are everybody knows that
[1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:23.080]  it's that first approximation they say women's intuition we all have it
[1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:27.160]  and uh you want to hurt me you want to hurt humanity
[1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:31.320]  i'll kill you it's not some macho statement here i'm saying i'm
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:35.240]  ready to die and it's not some big fancy thing
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:39.560]  i'm some big hero to do this oh thank you so much
[1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:43.000]  thank you for loving god thank you for not choosing death
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.920]  thank you for wanting to have a future do not thank me
[1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:51.640]  for wanting oxygen do not thank me for wanting to not be part of the satanist
[1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:56.360]  operation it's selfish to want to be with god
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:07:00.760]  i'm sorry it's true but these satanists have been cut off from god
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:04.840]  they have no idea what god's like they have no idea what the sermon's like
[1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:08.440]  and and getting so much discernment and so much power
[1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:12.520]  that you don't even want it it's like it says in revelation that those
[1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:15.720]  you know the white throne judgment the saints in front of god and god's giving
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:18.920]  them these crowns of authority and they're just throwing them back like
[1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:24.440]  this is ridiculous crowns of power for doing the
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:29.160]  wanting to be with you it's like you ain't eating in three days
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:32.120]  there's the most delicious buffet you've ever had
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:35.480]  with big old goblets of iced tea and everything and you're like
[1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:39.320]  they're like god's like here you're like god's like thank you for being here
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:45.000]  thank me for being here i i i make that point folks because
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:50.200]  people really think it's extraordinary to stand up to evil
[1:07:54.680 --> 1:08:00.840]  it's all a psychic thing one time i was in east texas on a ranch
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:03.640]  hog hunting it was raining it was there in the summer
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:10.520]  i was walking around in shorts pamo shirt sandals and had a ak-47
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:14.600]  and i wanted to shoot some hogs because there's no season on those
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:19.880]  and a big old mexican red wolf came out that's what they're called it's like
[1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:22.760]  it looks just like black but it's got long red hair too it's really cool
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:28.280]  looking wolf came out and looked at me only about
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:32.600]  30 yards ahead in the bushes seen a mount mount line a few times too
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:36.920]  and and by the time i even thought i was going to raise my gun
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:40.840]  it had a thought of understanding and disappeared
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:45.000]  now if i would have metaphysically seen a wolf
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.880]  big old black red wolf looking at me through those bushes and i'd have like
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:53.560]  rolled over and certainly it would have come and literally
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:57.240]  tore my throat out but obviously it knew i was the alpha predator
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:00.840]  i had a weapon i wasn't scared i was swinging that gun around
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:04.520]  i couldn't help it if i had thought i wouldn't kill a beautiful wolf like
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:06.600]  that they're they're not even they're super
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:10.040]  endangered in texas i couldn't help it it's another predator
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:13.560]  i was swinging that gun around taking it off safety
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:18.760]  and by the time i put that gun on target he was gone the bushes were like this
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:22.200]  beautiful wolf looking right at me couldn't help it just gone
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:27.720]  like it's going wow and i'm like what are you gonna even pull five
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:32.280]  i was right on him he was gone and almost shot through the bushes i probably
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:35.320]  would have got him but i couldn't make myself do it i was like
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:37.720]  kind of like a mountain line one time during during dirt season i was going
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:41.640]  to this tree stand down on swamp and i was getting off of it in the
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:44.360]  afternoon and saw that mountain line and couldn't
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:49.080]  bring myself to kill it but it was gone just as fast as i saw it
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:52.840]  but but like i i said i'd go to your phone calls i need to go to him i i need
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:57.560]  to hit the uh black lives matter news here but
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:04.120]  the point is coyotes in history have never attacked humans
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.080]  now they're eating people or attacking people
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:10.440]  in canada and the u.s because people see them and fall down and start screaming
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:13.800]  you've seen the karen's like where a black guy walks by you know at
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:19.800]  central park and makes a joke so the woman goes you do that with a wolf
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:24.520]  you're gonna get eaten and so i guess the parable
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:28.920]  and what i'm saying is groveling
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:33.880]  to anybody that's a predator a white guy a black guy that's a criminal
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:38.680]  whatever a wolf a coyote makes them respond like anybody will tell you if
[1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:42.280]  dogs come running you're walking your dog or you're out with your baby on a
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:45.480]  stroller and dogs come running out of some garage at you
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:49.800]  you don't run from the dogs if you run from the dogs
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:52.600]  they will instinctively chase you down and attack you
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:56.920]  you run towards them they will run away even grizzly bears in most cases
[1:10:56.920 --> 1:11:01.640]  if you're confident and stand your ground will run away
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:06.840]  but most people think in culture running away is the way from black lives matter
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:10.520]  or antifa or the left or any of these bullies
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:13.720]  or the black widows you know from any which way but loose
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:17.640]  is a good art type of that no running away from this stuff
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:21.720]  got us in this position why don't you start not running away
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:26.120]  and feel how high you are and how strong you feel and how good it is
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:31.800]  and even if you're getting your ass beat at least you weren't a sheep
[1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:38.120]  oh this is good this is a judo scope you see that one mark blue not to kill
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:43.800]  and all the red ones are marked for death
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:47.480]  i didn't know they had footage of a judo scope wow they got footage of this

[1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:07.800]  who gets what resources who gets what jobs but in reality it's building a
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.240]  post human world so that you can be made obsolete domesticated
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:18.680]  dumbed down drugged distracted atomized and then slowly

[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:57.400]  theory or not the globalist controllers do and they constantly
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:02.440]  write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:06.440]  crises that force humans to quote evolve in a
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:09.960]  new better way now when you study how they actually want you to evolve you
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:12.360]  believe in that it is to stop having children

[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:55.240]  white they got a few black people with them that are like marcess
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.200]  leaders of it and they're screaming at black people trying to eat dinner
[1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:05.000]  and they walk right over the tables of black people and scream at them
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.880]  because what they're really attacking is just everybody you got about us
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:12.760]  here's that video
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:18.920]  what's up instagram so i'm not here downtown dallas trying to have a peaceful
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:23.720]  evening and we've got these cards behind me look at this
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:29.560]  look at this majority majority white people in this crowd
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:35.560]  that want to feel good about themselves look at this they want to feel good
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:39.960]  about themselves so they're out here ruining
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:43.480]  an otherwise peaceful evening with their being

[1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:52.440]  majority white people out here acting a fool because they want to feel like
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:56.040]  they're important look at this look at the racial
[1:17:56.040 --> 1:18:01.000]  makeup of this think about what the purpose of this would be
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:05.640]  remember that opal tometi and patrice colors
[1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:10.040]  all the founders of this organization and they are knitting on camera
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:13.640]  that they are trained marcess all they care about
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:17.720]  is anarchy and social unrest look at this
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:24.280]  look at this again majority white crowd yelling in because they want to feel
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:27.240]  like they belong to something
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:31.160]  this is this is the real problem that we have and
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:34.840]  i was joining my evening until these people came out here
[1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:38.280]  inside before see they're out here cursing we got
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:41.640]  look at this hit pause look at this you literally have what martin
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:45.720]  lizard king back in the 1960s talked about black people with white people
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:49.320]  having to be in together and being happy and it's happening and here comes a
[1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:53.320]  nazi collaborator group literally from a nazi that said he was happy
[1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:58.760]  making to round up jews crazy sorrows with crazy people
[1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:03.720]  literally screaming at a crowd half black and half white eating dinner
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:06.360]  and the tables are like black and white people together having dinner and
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:09.880]  that's what they're pissed about folks and people see right through it
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:14.200]  but there's enough idiots that they can get to go along with this look let's
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:18.280]  but notice this man is knows who runs it he knows their marxists
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:23.640]  and he knows their main mission is having black men cut their balls off
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:29.720]  the group that says they love black people once black men's balls cut off
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:32.840]  i'm gonna explain that i know everybody gets this like when someone wants your
[1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:37.160]  balls cut off they don't just want you dead they want your people dead
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:41.080]  i don't want anybody's balls chopped off and that's what this whole
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:45.480]  new world order medical expert and you're like this is insane it is insane
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:49.400]  that's the thing about cults and they want us to accept this let's let's
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:53.960]  continue what happened in dallas yesterday we've got look at this
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:57.240]  look at this we've got little kids right here on their karson like it's no big

[1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:17.080]  apprehended by the police they'd be the first ones to come out here and scream
[1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:19.960]  like there's some kind of discrimination because they're the ones out
[1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:24.600]  here who are fomenting this discord they're fomenting this unrest
[1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:27.720]  all they care about right now is creating a scene
[1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:31.160]  that's why i want you to see this right now and now they're coming into the
[1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:36.680]  restaurant this goes on and on this goes on
[1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:44.600]  check it out literally run by an officer look at this idiot she's karson we

[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:29.160]  restaurant that's the problem see we got more people coming right now
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:32.840]  that's all they want to do yeah i can't be around this all they want to do
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:38.360]  this is not this is not what we should be doing this is not how we should react
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:41.320]  this is not how we should be carrying ourselves look at this little white
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:43.960]  dude over here right now this thing right from the air
[1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:48.760]  thinking he's doing something look at this i was trying to have
[1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:53.560]  hit pause can you imagine you randomly go find a restaurant
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:57.560]  that obviously is run by black people and then half the people there are black
[1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:01.880]  and you run and tell them ask you and start pushing them
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:05.960]  i mean you could no one could even imagine like there's a restaurant
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:09.720]  whether they were mexican white black i'm gonna run in there and start i mean
[1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:13.240]  i'm a i'm a tough guy okay i'd be scared to do that
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:17.720]  i mean i'd be scared to just walk into a restaurant say i'm gonna beat your ass
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:22.200]  and start shoving people i mean you'll get your ass blown off doing that
[1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:27.960]  but that's the type of crazy agent provocateurs they brought in
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:31.000]  because you know if somebody pulled a gun and shot those folks they'd say white
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:34.920]  supremacist kills black lives matter
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:37.720]  wouldn't matter if it was a black guy shooting them like the black somali
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:41.480]  running over people blocking the highway they don't care
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:46.200]  all right your calls are coming up i'm gonna come back go write to your calls
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:50.600]  after i play nick canon says white people are true savages
[1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:54.120]  you hear this you know this is this is ridiculous
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:58.440]  this is what's being taught by george soros
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:04.280]  people say well george soros is an idiot he's not gonna win
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:08.600]  george soros is overthrown 24 countries that i know of
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:12.680]  on record he brags about it so let me tell you something
[1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:16.040]  he thinks he's gonna win so everybody just sits here it's like saying
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:19.480]  the new england patriots three years ago had already won like five super bowls
[1:23:19.480 --> 1:23:22.680]  or whatever it was you're like oh the patriots think they're gonna win
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:27.160]  he keeps winning because we keep laying down
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:31.560]  so you can sit there and go this is preposterous this doesn't make sense
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:35.960]  okay well if you sit there and by end of that we're gonna lose folks
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:39.640]  he brags that he's funding all of this
[1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:46.040]  all of it and he loves it a big fat blood sucking nazi the real deal
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:24:01.960]  george damn him to hell soros it's the end of the world as we know it
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:09.400]  it's the end of the world as we know it and i don't feel fun
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:13.640]  this entire takeover has been battle pun end blue printed
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:17.480]  war-gamed field marshaled by the psychological war chiefs
[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:22.680]  at the united nations and the fortune 100 this is the post human takeover the
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:27.560]  new skits tighter when you comply not looser the entire
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:31.240]  covid-19 operation as a hoax now they admit the quote death
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:33.240]  numbers are dropping because those are fake
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:36.040]  where they count people that died of something else but it's all about how
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:40.120]  many cases there are and now they're saying most of the population will get
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:43.400]  it and then no one can go outside ever again
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.760]  it's totally insane it's a fraud it's all alive
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:52.840]  the reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:57.080]  the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:01.560]  we've gone over those purposes many times here on air
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.320]  the cashless society the surveillance system global government medical
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:10.360]  tyranny forced inoculation but the most important facet is it teaches us that
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.680]  we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.240]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:22.280]  take over the jobs that people once had
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:27.880]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:32.200]  it's been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:35.400]  predatory and through governmental actuaries and
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:40.120]  tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:45.080]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:57.800]  this is the truest form of technocracy fascism

[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:56.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:07.800]  discover trends and global developments
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:14.200]  years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:18.120]  all right i want to finish up just a few more minutes i mean there's
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:24.280]  20 minutes of this but i want to finish up with just a little bit more of
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:27.960]  a restaurant that's got black waiters managers
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:31.720]  reportedly part black owned it's half black people eating there in the middle
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:34.440]  of Dallas but Dallas is a black city much as
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:39.800]  Detroit or the Baltimore Maryland or DC and a bunch of white people show up
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:42.440]  screaming and yelling and starting to fight so the few black people with them
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:45.640]  i'm surprised they didn't get hurt man i grew up in Dallas people must have
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:48.120]  learned a lot of restraint up there because you look at somebody wrong in
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.200]  Dallas thinking you're black or white you're gonna get in a fight at least when
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:55.400]  i was growing up during the 80s and 90s so they're trying to provocateur
[1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.280]  something and then we've got this other clip and we'll go to your calls of
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:00.920]  nick cannon
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:04.680]  coming out and and spewing all those racist garbage but this is
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:08.200]  what's been mainline and i'll show you some examples of that in a moment but
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:11.480]  here's a little bit more from uh Dallas
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:16.360]  enjoying my evening until these people showed up
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.120]  and now they've ruined a peaceful evening we had live music out here
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:24.040]  they're ruining this evening just because someone
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:28.280]  actually spoke up for themselves this guy now they're throwing
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:31.240]  look at this now they're throwing see here we go
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:34.200]  Dallas police is out here
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:40.200]  yep Dallas police now Dallas police has to be out here doing this
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:43.480]  because these people can't behave because they literally look what they're
[1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:49.160]  doing look at this this is this is marxism cultural marxism to a T
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:52.920]  they did not come out here to be heard they came out here to create a scene
[1:28:52.920 --> 1:28:57.160]  you gotta realize what this this really is and call it out for what it really is
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:00.760]  this is not the answer out here at this restaurant tonight we had
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:04.920]  plenty of white people plenty of black people out here all having a good time
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:08.600]  and they came out here to create the scene let's take pause
[1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:12.200]  and now Paul Joseph Watson wrote a great article about this but
[1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:17.400]  it's not even accurate black lives matter mob in vays del's restaurant
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:21.560]  tries to start riot if you're a tv viewer you see this
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:25.400]  you have people physically attacking white and black
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:29.320]  managers that are trying to stop them attacking people at their tables
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:33.640]  the real headline is black lives matter sorrows fun and black lives matter
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:37.320]  physically attacks innocent people at restaurant
[1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:45.080]  that's what happened continuum
[1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:48.040]  see we're still going
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:51.560]  by the way since when do you assault cops not get arrested
[1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:57.400]  i mean this is out of control man now we got tear gas coming out
[1:29:57.400 --> 1:30:01.000]  now we got tear gas coming out now they're throwing stuff
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:06.920]  see tear gas is coming yep they brought this on this entire
[1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:09.400]  establishment they brought this on the entire
[1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:13.480]  establishment because they cannot hey and they can't learn how to express
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:25.000]  themselves like adults
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.960]  this was purposeful
[1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:33.880]  remember we were all out here just enjoying a peaceful dinner right
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:38.600]  they came out here and they started this mess i want you to see this first hand
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:42.280]  because i guarantee you in the news you will hear about some sort of violent
[1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:46.360]  demonstration you will hear about this
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:51.560]  i think it was you yeah you will hear about this
[1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:55.160]  you got you i understand i understand love you too but no so
[1:30:55.160 --> 1:30:59.320]  they came out here with a purpose and look at this
[1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:03.800]  all these tables were full before the way that they cleared this entire restaurant
[1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:07.560]  because they could not behave and handle themselves appropriately now they're
[1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:11.480]  throwing stuff this is this is the anarchy that
[1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:15.400]  they want this is what they continue to do
[1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:25.560]  listen to it now we're breaking windows
[1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:29.080]  i just wanted to share that with y'all because this literally just developed
[1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:32.760]  right behind me if y'all have a right to see what the real agenda is because
[1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:36.520]  right here this is people of all races all nationalities out here having a good
[1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:39.800]  time and these people came out here and they created a scene
[1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:43.480]  they've created this chaos that's what they want and now they're out
[1:31:43.480 --> 1:31:47.720]  they've ruined this evening essentially because they cannot express
[1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:51.400]  themselves like actual adults all they care about right now
[1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:54.840]  is creating this manufactured outrage this chaos
[1:31:54.840 --> 1:32:01.000]  because they their rationale is if we are upset
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.720]  no one else can enjoy any peace whatsoever that's right we're going to come
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:07.160]  harass you and dominate you until you bow to us all right let me play this final
[1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:11.160]  club i'm gonna go to your phone calls but this is again the ultra rich
[1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:15.320]  funding this weird nazi collaborator george soros
[1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:18.680]  and the fact they can find enough idiots to go out and do this because they
[1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:21.880]  know the national media is never going to show you this footage
[1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:25.640]  they're going to say oh a white supremac killed some black people
[1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:29.960]  when they finally get somebody to fight back that's all they care about is
[1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:33.880]  getting that charlottesville moment
[1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:39.080]  that's all they're looking for that's all they care about
[1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:41.720]  all right let's shift gears and go to your calls
[1:32:41.720 --> 1:32:44.920]  nick cannon i guess he was married to mariah carry or whatever
[1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:50.920]  canned off of his uh podcast after anti-seminic slurs and anti-white filth
[1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:54.520]  here is part of what he had to say but then i'm going to show you
[1:32:54.520 --> 1:32:57.800]  mainstream news articles where they're saying the exact same thing
[1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.760]  this guy ought to be the editor of the new york times here he is
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:03.960]  then let's go let's let's go to what it really is then when we talk about the
[1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:07.560]  power of melanated people when we talk about who we really are as guys in
[1:33:07.560 --> 1:33:11.880]  understanding that our melanin is so power and it connects us in a way
[1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:15.480]  that the reason why they fear black the reason why they fear is because they
[1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:18.680]  the lack that they have of it so then when you see
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:22.360]  what's you know dr uh franticy wasling talked about
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:28.040]  is that fear in that that the genetic annihilation efficiency of when you have
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:31.720]  a person that has has the lack of pigment the lack of
[1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:34.920]  melanin that they know that they will be annihilated so
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:39.480]  therefore however they got the power they they they have the lack of
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:42.920]  compassion that melanin comes with compassion
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:46.760]  melanin comes with soul that we call we call it soul we've soul brothers and
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:50.520]  sisters that's the melanin that connects us so the people that don't have it
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:55.560]  have are are a little and i'm gonna say this carefully
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:34:01.400]  are a little less and and and where the term actually comes from because i'm
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:05.000]  bringing it all the way back around to minister ferrican to where
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:10.440]  they may not have the compassion or the the when they were sent to the
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:13.560]  mountains of caucuses when they when they didn't have
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:17.960]  the power of the sun that was that the sun then started
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:22.840]  to deteriorate so then they're acting out of
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:27.080]  fear they're acting out of low self-esteem
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:29.800]  okay so that's the nothing goes into jews all the rest of it
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:34.920]  i mean here's the deal this is more mind control
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:38.520]  but this is what's taught on the colleges so this is what you should expect
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:41.880]  for total division because this is how the big mega banks that literally have
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:46.040]  three million muslims in slave camps in china
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:50.600]  but you don't hear lebron james or this guy talk about it they use our open
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:55.480]  free society to talk crap about everything
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:58.600]  and say that white people are inherently bad
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:02.920]  because of lack of pigment in their skin that's race theory that's right out of
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:06.280]  the nazis let me show a few articles that dub
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:09.960]  tell us instagram censor's user for objecting to
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:14.360]  mute white people sticker calls criticism hate speech so all over
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:18.200]  instagram they're promoting mute white people don't listen to white people
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:21.480]  white people are bad if you criticize it you get banned
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:26.120]  here's another one leading art curator resigns after allegedly saying
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.880]  he definitely still continue to collect white artists
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:33.160]  because there's big calls in san francisco that white artists inherently
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:35.640]  are bad
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:40.120]  this is a total cult this is not run by black people folks
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:44.440]  this is run by soros creating racial division in the country
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:48.440]  and it's absolutely we're going to go to break and we're going to go to
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:52.200]  collars in michigan and new york and florida ohio canada california
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:56.920]  pennsylvania louisiana denmark and many others talk to johnny and denmark first
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:35:59.960]  when we come back uh briefly we've extended store wide
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:03.240]  free shipping and double patreon points because we're not ready to launch the
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.920]  new toothpaste yet and that's great we're just keeping the sale going
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:11.000]  it's christmas in july and a bunch of items
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:15.080]  that were not available anymore have come back in
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:19.160]  and they are 50 off as well so the sale gets
[1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:22.840]  even bigger rainforest plus 50 off turbo four six percent off
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:26.040]  survival shield x2 50 percent off lung closer to percent off vitamin
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:29.400]  refusion and it goes on bodies you name it and that funds our
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:33.880]  operation got some new t-shirts in as well that evil american eagle
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:37.800]  the left now claims is a nazi symbol you've got those shirts available as
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:40.760]  well the funding the operation is a true act of
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:43.880]  rebellion against tyranny
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:51.160]  been on air in 26 years starting about 24 years ago
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:54.520]  i began to get calls from major hollywood directors
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:58.920]  producers actors they wanted to meet with me and they said what is your formal
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:01.640]  education i said well really nothing but a few years of
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:05.320]  college they said well how are you one of the best
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:08.600]  science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:12.360]  the stuff you come up with is just unbelievable
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:15.320]  we'd like you to be in movies we'd like you to write with us we'd like you to
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:18.280]  do voiceovers you're just a renaissance man that folks know
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:21.480]  i was in some movies and harry sure made statements like that a lot of others
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:24.680]  i'm not bragging i kept explaining to him i said
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:27.800]  do you understand i didn't come up with any of this
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:31.640]  i'm reading globalist mit white papers and futurist
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:35.080]  documents and they would just laugh me and say oh no way
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:38.440]  then i would give them the documents they would get very very scared
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:41.560]  you know the next time i saw them in a few months and say man you're right this
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:44.840]  is just topic folks i didn't make any of this up
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:50.360]  okay it's real it's real the bad news is western governments have totally let
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:54.200]  multinational big tech bring in communist chinese style
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.760]  total net surveillance censorship with ai the good news is
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:01.720]  they had to do that to carry out this world government covet
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:05.400]  takeover this planetary corporate reset
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:09.960]  the covet covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:13.640]  and will smash them and the good news is there's still sites like
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:18.600]  band dot video news wars dot com info wars dot com
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:22.600]  all watching sites summit dot news and a lot of other great sites that are getting
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:27.720]  massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:31.800]  that is queen that is the master of our own
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:35.320]  destinies ladies and gentlemen there is a war on reality
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:39.720]  a war on civilization a war on our health a war on our economy
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:43.320]  but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:47.960]  will defeat it so take action or be slaves
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:51.080]  i know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:54.280]  we'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die and then we'll
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:57.160]  release the pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it harder
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:00.440]  and release it again and we'll be the virtuous second ones we'll be the angels
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:04.040]  even though our lord and master bill gates helped find the whole
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:10.760]  covid-19 oh no don't seduce me that's right
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.480]  that's the code word for bill gates this operation he carries out with his good

[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:24.040]  johnny and denmark you disagree you say
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:27.560]  trump is completely antinatal order and q whatever that means
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:35.320]  explain that to me okay uh what i actually said was um that i uh i you
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:39.400]  were asking for disagreements i actually disagree that uh trump
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:45.000]  is uh deficiently uh active against the nwo because i think i think you gotta
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.680]  consider the fact that um as you said many times you only gets four hours of
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:51.560]  sleep and i probably spent an hour with his wife he's probably working on this
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:55.880]  19 hours a day and he's not the kind of guy that just sits around and you know
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:59.880]  um doesn't do anything he's a man of action too but i think it's very
[1:41:59.880 --> 1:42:04.520]  important to realize as i mentioned to you on my call to you of uh january 13th
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:10.840]  that um he timing is very important to him and he's very good at uh breaking
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:14.680]  things down so that the average person and this is very important for people
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:18.120]  generally and especially info wars people to realize
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:21.880]  invites that the general population can understand
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:26.120]  for example if everyone out there were even half as politically astute as
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:29.000]  info wars listeners uh we wouldn't have these people in
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.840]  empowered to begin with i mean what meaning the nwo and we would have gotten
[1:42:32.840 --> 1:42:36.680]  rid of them on the basis of the right Trump's working with the problem
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:42.040]  of a public that's ill-informed yeah only ill-informed but also you know
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:45.480]  a pathetically short attention span uh you know as you mentioned
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:48.920]  repeatedly uh there was a recent study done that in some
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:53.000]  significant sense americans have a shorter attention span in goldfish now
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.440]  and so he's timing a lot of these things and i understand the frustration
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:59.800]  of wanting him to do something but if you look at it carefully he actually is
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:03.640]  doing things um but brother i totally agree with you that
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:07.480]  trump is a godsend and has taken power away from Fauci
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:12.760]  and exposing china and and and i agree and it's easy to be monday morning
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:15.000]  quarterbacks i hear you i appreciate your call joining
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:22.200]  all right let's go uh let's go to james and florida james go ahead welcome
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:28.120]  great to be here i just want to say uh the book 1984 really starting to creep
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:32.360]  me the fuck out i'm sorry for cussing the more i read about it
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:36.680]  so in the book it says that like they're trying to dumb you down
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:40.760]  and like people don't even know what words mean no one knows what socialism
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:44.600]  means socialism just means what are the government wants
[1:43:44.600 --> 1:43:50.040]  cops are socialism you should look up 2020 police brutality
[1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:53.320]  nothing but cops beating people cops beating people
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:56.600]  i believe in the new world order every conspiracy to there you say
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:00.200]  i'm a left winger who used to like bernie but i think he's a government
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:04.360]  shill all that but 2020 police brutality
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:08.120]  they're locking up people and then they're taking away the right to have a
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:12.840]  bond they passed uh trans rights and then they
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:17.000]  the government can take your blood without a warrant
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:20.520]  yeah no they create all these fake rights and your basic rights are taken
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:24.520]  and again i'm not growling to police we need to change the laws at the
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:27.400]  legislature i'm just saying attacking police all day
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:31.240]  who are given the laws to enforce is not the right place to attack
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.600]  you attack at the legislature does that make sense
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:38.600]  well yes i completely understand that but like ronald reagan so i'm just saying
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:44.680]  if you attack police all day that's like if your electricity goes off and you
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:47.560]  go beat up the the repair guy put the electricity in
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:52.200]  it's the it's the electricity company so all i'm saying is we have to go
[1:44:52.200 --> 1:44:55.160]  it's like tsa why are we mad at tsa running checkpoints
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:44:59.000]  groping kids when the borders are open congress should know that's a fraud
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.080]  congress should change the law attacking the
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:07.000]  the tsa worker they just get new workers you could run them off they just get
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:10.520]  new ones i appreciate your call though james
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:15.240]  mcayla in michigan you're on the air go ahead
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:18.600]  hey um i'm like really new to this and um
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:22.120]  hey it's good to have you here what what's on your mind i was just watching
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:25.800]  your podcast with our with uh joe rogan
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:29.720]  yes and uh i started doing research about what you said about like
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:33.400]  the guys using like psychedelics to you like
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:37.960]  contact these like higher beings or whatever and like listening to your
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:40.920]  podcast today i just been i've been doing like a lot of
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:45.000]  research on all this stuff with the new world and what did you discover
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:49.240]  like i don't know where this is all going like um i don't know if you've seen
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:52.840]  those video ipad go to but like you kind of like
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:57.400]  hints at this new world order where like there's like a fall in government
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:01.640]  possibly in christianity i just like i'm trying to make sense of it all and see
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:05.080]  how i connect and i guess i just wanted to like pick your brain
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:08.200]  well the fact that you're aware of it is what really matters i mean that most
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:11.800]  people aren't even conscious that there's another world there's a veil
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:15.080]  there's things beyond that you know we only see a very limited spectrum
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:19.240]  of light there's all these other spectrums in our own universe
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:24.360]  in our own dimension then there's dimensions stacked on top dimensions
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:28.440]  uh like i've been since like a young age like i'm 21 now like
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:31.960]  i've had like these experiences of like all awakenings and like
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:36.120]  outer body experiences and then like i grew up christian and
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:40.280]  i fell out of that and i had to like wonder what was going on with that
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:43.880]  kind of stuff and then like experimenting with psychedelics
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:48.360]  i got closer and closer like i'm just wondering like how this all connects
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:53.560]  like with the world and then you mentioned um these elite people
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:59.000]  actually use dnt and like how they use it to communicate with like
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:02.520]  evil beings do you remember that's basically
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:08.200]  look god gives us free will evil beings try to attack free will
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:11.640]  and so it it's very easy when you get this advanced knowledge to use it against
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:15.240]  people that don't have the knowledge that's interfering with free will
[1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:19.960]  and so the fact that you're overwhelmed by this is totally normal
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:23.720]  i mean anybody's overwhelmed by this unless you're god
[1:47:23.720 --> 1:47:27.000]  uh and and and so the big thing is anything that violates free will is
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:32.200]  bad and anything satanic will violate free will
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:35.480]  so that the left goes oh we're liberal we're for free speech but
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:38.760]  we control all your free speech and we want children
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:42.760]  when they're innocent to destroy their free will and so everything about this
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:45.480]  is destroying free will jesus christ is for free will
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:48.920]  satan is against free will satan claims is giving you knowledge
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:52.040]  of good and evil you're being given the opposite so
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:55.640]  i mean it just starts from there you're not going to get real christ in these
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:48:00.040]  mainline churches does that make sense yeah and like i just had another
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:02.680]  question with like because i'm like where i get
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:05.560]  conflicted or i'm trying to make sense of it all it's like
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:10.280]  so with trump being in um here's the thing
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:13.480]  mikaela you have to see it for yourself
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:16.120]  there's no way for me to tell you about it you got to just pray to god to give
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:18.520]  you discernment sounds like you've already
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:22.520]  partially there and you know i can't tell you about this
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:25.800]  you either have it or you don't and everybody has it
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:29.240]  but it's like god protects people most people can't handle this
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:32.520]  because if you tune into god you're going to tune into the dark side too
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:35.720]  so you have to understand that that you're like you really want enlightenment
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:39.800]  are you ready for it because it's big and it's it's bad and it's it's it's
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:43.800]  heavy that makes sense what does that mean for like what's
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:46.520]  going on now
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:52.360]  like if we want enlightenment and with everything going on now like well you
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:56.440]  have to know that the system's evil and controlled by satan
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:48:59.720]  and so anything it's pushing is going to be bad
[1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:03.800]  mikaela i really appreciate your call look i could take hundreds of calls that
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:08.040]  go on for days here and i don't have the answers god
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:12.040]  has the answers and your connection to god has the answers
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:15.080]  and i'm not some priest you're telling you i have the answers
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:17.720]  i just know i know the devil's real i know god's real
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:22.680]  and i know the enemy is after your free will that's what i know
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:27.080]  all right we've got a bunch of other callers carlos is a long-time caller
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:32.200]  always informative satan and the antichrist carlos in canada go ahead
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:36.440]  jesus what a coincidence your previous caller
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.360]  addresses the issue precisely alex you want to ask me as
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:44.280]  pathologically about what was the distinction between satan
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:49.320]  and the antichrist and listen what essentially
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.120]  one has to keep in mind as a human being is that we have things happen to us
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:57.800]  which are in accordance with our nature in the universe regardless of
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:01.320]  of race or color even for animals that which is in
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:05.560]  accordance with our nature is good for us we see a person that is dying of
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:08.120]  thirst in the desert you give him a glass of water
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:12.520]  that's a good deed however if you also have that will free will
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:15.560]  to understand that if you take a person and you give him
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:20.120]  who's dying of thirst 50 glasses of water continuously and you insist on drinking
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:23.640]  them you are causing that person harm so
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:28.360]  one deed is good and one deed which is not in accordance with one's nature
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:32.120]  is bad our realization in the world that we can do
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:36.680]  good things and bad things divide into the spiritual collective
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:40.760]  that is everything that is good in nature accordance with our nature
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:44.520]  is good and then we have the understanding the collective understanding
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:49.000]  that we are able to do things are evil to other people
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.040]  things are not in accordance with their nature that
[1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:58.040]  realization is a spiritual reality we call satan the ability to do evil
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:02.840]  when we consider free will as you said correctly in the context of the
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:06.040]  scriptures there's this passage where Jesus
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:09.880]  Christ the man is thinking a spiritual
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:13.640]  um career what he's going to be doing and how he's going to approach
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:17.960]  the issue of of his mission to reveal to everybody like your
[1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:22.360]  your previous scholar wanted to understand you know what is the reality
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.640]  of of existence he says there's a spiritual life
[1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:29.080]  at that point the temptation to take over the world
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:32.840]  appears and he says that's right stay there we'll come back in two minutes
[1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:37.880]  when carlo's finishing up she calls in asking me the secret of the universe
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:41.720]  so i was taking care of an errand this morning and i was even closer downtown
[1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:45.080]  but i was parked on old side street going to this business
[1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:48.280]  when i came back out i saw what looked like two
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:53.160]  asian folks probably chinese walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up
[1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:56.600]  ahead of me and here i am parked a truck with the windows up
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:51:59.960]  and the woman stops and points at me so they stop
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:02.920]  and they wait while i'm inside my truck truck started
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:06.840]  and they sit there and stretch keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:11.960]  like they're waiting for me to go because i'm not wearing a mask
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:15.640]  inside my car and so then i just sat there so they
[1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:19.800]  acted angry and walked past me i almost shot a video of it on my
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:23.480]  phone but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere this is mental
[1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:27.400]  illness people are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:30.360]  this is all cult programming this is all about submitting
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:34.600]  we cannot submit to this un brainwashing it's all a giant fraud
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:38.760]  we must expose the fraud or become slaves to it
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:42.840]  the reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:47.160]  the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes
[1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:51.640]  we've gone over those purposes many times here on air
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:55.800]  the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:59.240]  forced inoculation but the most important facet
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:03.240]  is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are
[1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:09.640]  non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:13.960]  over the jobs that people once had by design
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:17.960]  this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into
[1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:22.280]  it's been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:25.480]  predatory and through governmental actuaries and
[1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:30.280]  tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:35.240]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power
[1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:40.520]  this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:46.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:54:11.480]  all right carlos in canada always a red collar
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:14.680]  literally the next caller in line trying to one of the calls in and says what's
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:18.760]  the secret of the universe well the answer is free will and merging with
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:20.840]  god and following god's will doesn't mean i've
[1:54:20.840 --> 1:54:26.360]  got the secret of the universe i can kind of look at it doesn't mean i'm it
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:30.200]  but uh so finish up carl's the great points you're making
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:33.400]  well Satan is a spirit and he can't do anything to you
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:36.520]  any more than a spirit because they they're not material they're they're in
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:40.680]  material so when he the temptation arises for christ
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:44.760]  to say well when i take over the world he says no and
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:49.800]  Satan appears period he says get behind me saying he says get behind me
[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:53.960]  exactly however if that temptation should happen to another human being
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:58.120]  who does not reject it and says okay i'm talented i have money
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  oh i can run over the world right let's say let's say for example
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:07.320]  a person like bill gates okay he says look there's 7.2 billion people
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:11.960]  if i can convince the 7.2 billion people that they need to take a vaccine
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:16.040]  and i can charge $2,400 with redempt severe
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:20.680]  whom george soros owns the company gilead then we can make
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:28.200]  2.7.2 billion people pay $2,400 that's in the trillions
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:32.360]  so there is evil because you see the rhythm death severe
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:35.560]  we know doesn't even work so there you got a problem
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:38.120]  that becomes it's not in accordance with your nature
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:41.320]  which is evil and vouching put out a fake study
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:46.120]  that only helps you eight percent more but that's a lie exactly it's ridiculous
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  right so that's the anti-crash you see the anti-crash is the human being
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:53.080]  who with their talent and their money and their power
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:58.760]  decides to go against states against government free will against the church
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:02.760]  look black lives matter but to kill a young woman
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:08.280]  because she says all lives matter is a terrorist organization is that not pure
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:11.320]  satanism you come with a gun and say say only
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:15.240]  black lives matter that she says no it's like christians being thrown into
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:18.680]  the roman arena she literally says no all lives matter
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:21.960]  and they blow her head off i mean what how is that not that is
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:26.440]  sensationally evil and the whole media backs that up
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:30.040]  sir with all respect to the media and to all of those people that think that was
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:33.480]  a great deed let me tell them something that's the act of a terrorist
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:36.520]  organization and if george soros is running a
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:40.520]  terrorist organization he should be put in padlocks the next dollar he gives it
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:44.520]  because you know what that's not what people are protesting about
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:48.440]  police brutality is real there's no debate about that police
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:51.480]  should be corrected and the government i hope the president does something about
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:55.480]  it but to to burn churches has nothing to do with police brutality
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:57.960]  exactly it's an evil agenda that's hijacked it
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:01.400]  where do you see this going gut level do you think trumps get more hardcore
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:04.040]  start the turn the corner you still think he's in trouble
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  no i think the president in united states is what the american people deserve
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:12.200]  now providentially and if the people of the united states to not use the power
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:15.320]  of the ballot they will face the power of the bullet
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:18.920]  that's what happens okay so be smart be safe
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:22.360]  do it which is in accordance with your nature put your hand in your heart and
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:25.560]  say it's the first lady of the united states
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:29.400]  milania trump when she says bring the best out of children
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:33.400]  that is the most powerful message that history can teach any nation
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:36.840]  because what a nation brings the children to its full potential
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:40.680]  that is her nation worth keeping but what a nation does not make the best
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:44.360]  potential of a human being like your previous scholar who questions
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:47.400]  what about the universe what about goodness what about god
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:50.840]  and embraces immortality through free will alex
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:55.480]  free will to choose god that is the biggest gift you can give to yourself
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.120]  for having been alive exactly god bless you my friend
[1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:03.560]  that's it i mean satanism is an attack on free will
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:07.640]  and choosing to go against god's law which is
[1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:11.000]  victory i mean god's law is a success everything good
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:14.600]  and uh it's it's it's it's just crazy that people
[1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:18.360]  choose not to go with god now when we come back i'm gonna host into the fourth
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:20.760]  hour so we'll get to all the collars you want to hold or not you can hang up and
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:23.960]  call back but joe scousen i'm trying to get into
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:27.560]  town we do a two-hour special on strategic relocation
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:32.040]  he's about to join us via skype and get into
[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:35.240]  the politics of the world right now and where we are and what he thinks
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:38.200]  is about to happen in this election we'll talk about it all straight ahead
[1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:44.280]  covered 19 and more with joe scousen of world affairs brief
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:51.400]  the bad news is western governments have totally let multinational big tech
[1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:55.160]  bring in communist chinese style total net surveillance
[1:58:55.160 --> 1:58:59.880]  censorship with ai the good news is they had to do that to carry out this
[1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:04.920]  world government covet takeover this planetary corporate reset
[1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:09.480]  the covet covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them
[1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:13.160]  and will smash them and the good news is there are still sites like
[1:59:13.160 --> 1:59:18.120]  band dot video news wars dot com info wars dot com
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:22.200]  paul watson sites summit dot news and a lot of other great sites that are getting
[1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:27.240]  massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king
[1:59:27.240 --> 1:59:31.320]  that is queen that is the master of our own
[1:59:31.320 --> 1:59:34.840]  destinies ladies and gentlemen there is a war on reality
[1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:39.720]  a war on civilization a war on our health a war on our economy but being
[1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:42.840]  aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it
[1:59:42.840 --> 1:59:47.960]  will defeat it so take action or be slaves
[1:59:53.480 --> 1:59:58.280]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[1:59:58.280 --> 2:00:01.960]  it's alex jones
[2:00:07.560 --> 2:00:11.560]  all right joe scousen runs world affairs brief dot com is the editor there
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:14.920]  he was a naval marine corps aviator in vietnam
[2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:18.600]  his family's been at the forefront of exposing the globalists from the
[2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:22.040]  beginning clion scousen and i really respect his view because it's one of
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:25.880]  the most accurate views out there and i'm trying to get him to town soon
[2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:29.000]  these agreed to do it to come do two hours on my show two hours a day but
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:32.360]  night two hours on owen or more just about where to
[2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:37.640]  strategically relocate because i personally cannot live in austin anymore
[2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:40.520]  and pay for the abortions because if you live here it's the only county in texas
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:45.000]  where they make you pay for abortions and it's just too dangerous now
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:48.520]  they've got homeless everywhere communist everywhere it's like
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:54.440]  la is emptied out here it's really out of control but then where do i go
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:58.520]  and and and i've studied the country so i know when i've studied his book
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:01.800]  and his film about this that's very accurate but we made the film
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:04.920]  five six years ago the books five six years old there's a new there's a new
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:07.320]  edition we'll show that to you but we're not here to sell books
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:11.080]  we're here to understand that there's a system coming in
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:15.400]  that doesn't want families that doesn't want free will that that wants to
[2:01:15.400 --> 2:01:19.480]  create a system so horrible a false reality so horrible that
[2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:22.680]  children are born into something where they can't even differentiate
[2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:26.440]  and can be tricked into giving up their free will so i didn't talk to joel
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:30.440]  scousen before he came on of worldoffirstbrief.com
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:33.640]  and joel scousen.com about what he wants to cover up front
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:38.520]  but just the big picture because he always talks about trump is not a bad guy
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:42.280]  but trump doesn't have good advisers and it's totally true it's been proven
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:45.080]  right that he does understand conspiracy he
[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:49.320]  does understand the big issues and and that's his pitfall so do we advise the
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:53.720]  president do we predict what's coming next you know the big war with china
[2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:59.800]  the election election fraud the biggest perils joel scousen sees for the next
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:02.920]  eight minutes before we go to break joel you have the floor what do you want to
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:07.640]  hit first what do you want to impart to the audience first
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:11.240]  well first of all let's talk about donald trump he
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:15.640]  he does with his instincts see some things he just reposted on monday a
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:19.080]  tweet uh by another person saying that we're being
[2:02:19.080 --> 2:02:22.760]  lied to about the pandemic and that means that trump has good
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:26.120]  instincts about that but he doesn't have the backup information so the white
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:29.240]  house comes out and there's books and oh no no he's there's no disagreement with
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:33.640]  fauti he's fine they're undermining the president
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:37.640]  because the president doesn't have anyone around him to feed him the facts
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.400]  that the tests are not accurate and that's what's driving this agenda
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:45.640]  is that everyone's testing positive well the death rate is plummeting
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:48.840]  so we know the tests aren't accurate we know that the tests pick up
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:53.480]  all types of coronavirus is not just cobit 19 and that anyone dying is because
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:56.120]  of chronic disease and immunodeficiency
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:00.680]  virtually a hundred percent nobody who's healthy dies or even really doesn't
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:03.960]  matter if he takes control of the testing because
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:07.880]  still they're going to engage in fraud
[2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:11.800]  well that's right i don't know how you take control of the testing the point is
[2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:16.520]  they falsified the test they don't have a gold standard a gold standard on a
[2:03:16.520 --> 2:03:20.200]  cobit 19 test would be a complete genetic breakdown
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:24.760]  which would take a couple of weeks to do for every test
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:28.040]  that's what it would take to actually determine because there's so many refined
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:32.840]  little pieces of RNA when you take a common piece of RNA that's about
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:36.680]  that's common in any coronavirus and then you amplify it with the PCR test
[2:03:36.680 --> 2:03:39.640]  you know sure you're going to have tons of false positives
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:44.040]  but there's this needs to be outlawed there needs to be put
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:48.920]  Trump needs to say you prove to this group of scientists that this test is
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:52.360]  valid and actually does pick up cobit 19 and only
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:55.640]  cobit 19 or we're going to stop the testing
[2:03:55.640 --> 2:03:59.000]  and we're going to you know declare this pandemic
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:02.120]  so let's stop there that's exactly where i was going i'm going to start over
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:05.960]  you're perfectly right what is the blueprint you just said it
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:10.280]  trump says i want you to scientifically prove your fraudulent test
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:14.120]  it's been proven wrong and that will shut them down so give your advice right
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:18.280]  down jose callison of world affairs brave to president trump
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:22.440]  but president trump needs to shut down this phony testing by
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.560]  he can't arbitrarily do it he's got to have scientists and there's
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:29.800]  plenty of them who say this test is not valid
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:33.480]  and he needs to say you prove that it's valid within
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:38.280]  you know five ten days or i'm declaring this pandemic over
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:42.360]  and you know the the great thing they could do he's he's being too silent
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:45.880]  you know a tweet just isn't going to do it he needs to come out and campaign
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:49.240]  very strongly that this is a phony pandemic this has been done
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:53.000]  not only to destroy the american economy but also to destroy my reelection
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:56.840]  chances by making everyone dissatisfied with them
[2:04:56.840 --> 2:05:01.080]  and and if he starts to come out and fight this there are a tremendous amount
[2:05:01.080 --> 2:05:04.360]  of people who already suspect that this is baloney
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:09.400]  people are resisting the mask mandate all over the united states
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:13.720]  just totally unnecessary the mask don't work it's just hype
[2:05:13.720 --> 2:05:17.800]  and uh people are getting tired of it so trump could become extremely popular
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:21.720]  no i totally agree if he tackles this and exposes a fraud
[2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:25.560]  and and exposes fauci he will win if he if he stays
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:29.000]  basically in the middle of this luke warm he's gonna lose
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:32.520]  exactly right alex and he is staying middle because he's got advice you're
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:35.080]  saying oh no you can't counter dick dr fauci
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:39.560]  but by the way in italian means jaws plural
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:43.880]  dr jaws is is part of the deep part of the deep state
[2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:47.880]  he's making millions for his organization is himself personally so as bill
[2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:51.160]  gates they're formulating on rna vaccine which is
[2:05:51.160 --> 2:05:54.680]  going to be very dangerous they're going to be a vaccine mandate eventually
[2:05:54.680 --> 2:05:59.560]  that's why it's so easy to destroy fauci with the insider trading
[2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:03.960]  and the conflicts of interest i mean trump's got him
[2:06:03.960 --> 2:06:07.800]  that's right now he's going to get a lot of backlash from the news media you know
[2:06:07.800 --> 2:06:11.400]  talking about conspiracy theories and they'll say oh all this has been
[2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:15.960]  debunked about fauci that's why he's got to have the facts
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:19.800]  trump if he's wise he'd better hire an advisor to know what's going on in the
[2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:22.920]  state who can get the facts for him someone who can run
[2:06:22.920 --> 2:06:26.840]  and knows how to find the experts to get him the facts to back these things up
[2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:31.480]  because if they attack well in the media and he's got the facts to back him up he
[2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:34.680]  can destroy them but if they attack him he doesn't
[2:06:34.680 --> 2:06:38.200]  have the facts to back up they just say always tweeting again then it's going to
[2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:42.760]  be a problem for him so you know there's a lot of
[2:06:42.760 --> 2:06:46.360]  other things going on but right now our biggest problem is going to be to reelect
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:50.280]  donald trump not because donald trump has really changed much he has slowed down
[2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:53.960]  the globalist agenda he's given them fits just because he keeps
[2:06:53.960 --> 2:06:56.920]  changing his mind but they want him out of the way and i'll tell you if joe
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:00.040]  biden gets in we're going to have complete loss of
[2:07:00.040 --> 2:07:04.760]  free speech gun rights we're going to have the green new deal shut down about
[2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:08.920]  that what happens if joe biden gets in what what they're planning
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:14.280]  well joe biden is already talking about uh doing a climate change agenda he's
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:17.400]  talking about uh you know anti-determination
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:22.120]  increasing anti-determination laws uh we're going to take black he's going to
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:25.800]  take black lives matter we're just about black lives matter it's about
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:29.480]  shutting down your free speech and shutting down the free speech of
[2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:34.360]  CEOs and college professors everywhere i mean there's just a vendetta on of
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:39.240]  anyone even refuses to take a a hostile point of view
[2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:43.640]  against western culture you're racist they're just name calling all over the
[2:07:43.640 --> 2:07:47.560]  place and someone needs to uh to really stop it i mean the censorship is
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:52.280]  incredible that's going on well that's it i mean western christian civilization
[2:07:52.280 --> 2:07:56.040]  is antithetical to the satanic new world order so it must be attacked and all
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:08:00.040]  these ceo's think you can picture like it goes away no you can picture like it's
[2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:03.160]  the end we need to stand for the cross for christ
[2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:06.760]  for the west now how do we do that
[2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:12.280]  you know it's really hard when they have all of the levers of power tied up i
[2:08:12.280 --> 2:08:15.240]  mean they tie it they've got google under their control amazon
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:19.880]  control my book strategic relocation the fourth edition just got taken down on
[2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:23.480]  july third on amazon they removed my listing it was
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:26.920]  the only one up there and they have refused to put it back
[2:08:26.920 --> 2:08:30.680]  up they keep giving me excuses you know saying oh it didn't have this technical
[2:08:30.680 --> 2:08:33.560]  and i changed that it didn't have this and i changed that and didn't
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:36.520]  and finally they came out and said we had to take it down
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:43.000]  um without reason and said you can get it back up by removing all inventory
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:46.200]  and what kind of an answer is that they're just messing with me
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:49.880]  it's like what happened to you years ago uh with youtube
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:54.600]  alex and of course they're attacking anything that's competent
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:58.920]  they don't want competent information out there
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.760]  well that's right i mean it's uh it's a war of information
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:06.600]  and um they know that if people get the right
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:09.880]  information most americans are still good people the
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:14.840]  the violent black lives matter minority is still a very small minority but it's
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:17.240]  growing because of the public education system
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:20.920]  dark baby oh it's being said it's repoted by the stay there
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:25.400]  Phil Scowles is our guest absolutely it is the establishment is the man
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:28.360]  black lives matter it's not the underdog it's not the rebel
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:32.760]  it is satan's army literally masquerading as
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:36.680]  black people as it's covered when it truth it wants to exterminate every
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:39.720]  person they can including black babies Phil Scowles in world of first
[2:09:39.720 --> 2:09:42.760]  briefs our guest stay with us
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:47.880]  a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:52.360]  and if you go back to those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:57.080]  tracking of cell phones how programmed master computers would
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:01.400]  manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:04.440]  large groups of human movements and activities but even
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:07.400]  predict what individuals would do and then once you can predict what
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:10.920]  individuals we're going to be doing you can add stimuli
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:14.040]  through the ai systems through the computers
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:17.480]  through digital billboards through face scanning through the social credit
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:20.280]  score to control people and make them act like you
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:24.360]  wanted to but when we cover that the media would attack us and say
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:28.360]  we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:31.960]  corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of the blueprint
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:35.000]  documents explained to us that they are setting up this
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:38.920]  control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's
[2:10:38.920 --> 2:10:42.120]  something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:45.000]  so we might want to dismantle the system now
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.440]  as the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:51.960]  nutritional needs with changes in diet unnatural
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:55.320]  ingredients and stress you may not be able to get all the necessary

[2:11:44.600 --> 2:12:05.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:08.680]  all right joel scowls at theworldoffirstbrief.com
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:12.280]  editor-in-chiefs our guest i'm Alex Schoinger host and joel's a smart guy
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:15.880]  he's studied this politically economically militarily but also from a
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:19.560]  spiritual perspective which i think is dead on the more i researched
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:23.160]  market into it and what he's talking about is actually what's happening
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:25.880]  so let's look at this i'm gonna throw you a wild card here
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:31.160]  from the perspective of god versus satan on this planet and free will this test
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:34.920]  we're part of what is satan planning to do to america
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:39.160]  and what does donald trump need to know to counter that
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:44.680]  well satan you know we're we're getting a front row seat to what satan is doing
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:52.200]  he's got a core of people who i believe there is revelatory
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:56.120]  control of a core of hierarchy of the globalist conspiracy
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:03.000]  and they in turn control a lot of impressive dark side figures within
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:05.400]  the administration what we call the deep state
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:08.680]  the deep state is not running things they take orders from higher up
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:14.680]  but it's interesting that satan uses a great deal of
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:19.800]  yesmanship from people so that a lot of many many millions of people who are
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:22.200]  involved in black lives matter and other things
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:25.720]  don't know about the conspiracy that's ultimately running the show
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:29.560]  but they're yes men for example the covid-19 phony pandemic
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:35.800]  could not have been done without an excessive and false honor towards the
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:39.160]  medical profession and so the education and
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:43.000]  media sadness has built up doctors over the year as the gold standard of
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.400]  something that we should always listen to
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:49.880]  and so even though this does not look evil on a time now it's being used for
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:53.720]  evil purposes so it's very very important
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:57.560]  yeah we know historically that authoritarian regimes use medical
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:01.960]  systems to push tyranny because it's trusted
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:05.560]  that's right and it shouldn't be trusted the medical system
[2:14:05.560 --> 2:14:09.960]  is very authoritarian the reason the doctors are going along with what's
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:12.520]  happening even though they know and have their suspicions
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:16.280]  i just consulted with one in in oklahoma this past week
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:20.280]  oh the state senator in in in uh minnesota is under
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:24.520]  investigation to be fired because he said it's overhyped and show the numbers
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:29.000]  sorry that's exactly right and every doctor knows if they do not follow the
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.680]  cdc guidelines on this stuff they're going to have their license
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:36.440]  revoked so it's all about licensing and control and the legislature
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:40.600]  has turned over their powers of control over the medical system to
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  state licensing boards and so they're completely independent and that's under
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:49.720]  NIH and that's under WHO so that's how we get the U.N. attack
[2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:53.240]  that's right so there's a hierarchical system of course
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:57.240]  that long ago you know the propaganda that our children get in public schools
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:01.000]  is finally coming home to ruse it's been over for a long time
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:04.040]  it's just so much visible to people because
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:07.960]  now when the media comes out in favor of this phony black lives matter and
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:11.400]  destroy western civilization call everyone a racist including
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:15.640]  Christopher Columbus and thomas jefferson and george washington
[2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:19.800]  uh so many of the public educated and college educated people have been
[2:15:19.800 --> 2:15:22.840]  indoctrinated are suddenly in board and we say what happened
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:26.680]  what's been going on for dozens of years it started when i was in high school in
[2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:30.040]  the 1960s when we had marxist and leninus
[2:15:30.040 --> 2:15:33.960]  professors started to pump this thing into the schools and you said this 20
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:39.000]  years ago they'd go after washington the flag that they want that
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:43.480]  that's right that's right now there's a misconception among many people commenting
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:47.480]  on the internet alex about this being a resurgence of communism
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:50.600]  because there's a lot of marxists and communists involved in the black lives
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:55.080]  movement but this is true but they have to remember
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:15:59.000]  that these are the globalists like george source who are funding these
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:02.760]  things and they have long ever since the beginning
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:06.280]  of the last century they have been funding communism to break down the
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:10.120]  social order so that they can come in with an alternative solution
[2:16:10.120 --> 2:16:13.560]  which people wouldn't accept going from free market to
[2:16:13.560 --> 2:16:18.520]  the semi-socialism of globalism communism brings down the capitalist system
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:23.000]  but it's not the system it just brings it down to bring in the globalist system
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:26.760]  that's right who comes in with a more moderate form it's still socialism but
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:30.120]  they tell you you own it you're still free you still have fundamental rights
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:33.560]  except except there's all kinds of exceptions
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:36.920]  both to regulate just like the EU constitution you got the right
[2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:41.000]  free speech except you've got the right of private property except
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:44.840]  and those exceptions are when the society needs it it's just incredibly
[2:16:44.840 --> 2:16:49.240]  deceptive and so this is this is a very
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:54.120]  serious satanic agenda what donald trump needs to know
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:59.160]  is that he's got to learn to fight openly he doesn't have to mention satan
[2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:02.040]  necessarily but he's no but i agree he has to call it out as a
[2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:05.240]  chicon globalist plot he has to hit it head on that's what
[2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:09.160]  has power that's right and he has to also for
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:12.920]  example defund the left one of the ways that he could do that
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:17.400]  is to get the irs to investigate the open society foundation of george
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:21.000]  source and democracy alliance those are the two major
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:23.880]  501 c3 organizations that are funding terror
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:27.000]  domestic terror in the united states and that's illegal
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:30.840]  but they do it with a very sophisticated money laundering system
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:34.440]  for example democracy alliance will give grants to
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:38.280]  black lives matter foundation which is not a five oath c3 organ
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:41.720]  explain this fraud because i talked to the fpio they don't even understand this
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:44.680]  i know your uncle's a famous fpi agent who exposed us
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:49.640]  explain how we bring them down cutting their money off
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:54.760]  well we have to 501 c3 charitable organizations are not allowed to give
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:17:59.320]  money to non charitable purposes they're not allowed let alone
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:03.480]  domestic or violent groups and things and so what they do
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:06.520]  is they have for example the black lives foundation
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:09.800]  they give them a certain amount of money and they tell black lives you give to
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:13.720]  some of our charitable foundations so that we can excuse
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:17.880]  giving money to you then you use what's left over to fund black lives
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:21.400]  matter and the violence and believe me they are funding
[2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:26.280]  this stuff they are paying protesters for example there was a major manager
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:30.120]  from marriott hotel a international hotel change
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:33.960]  who said two weeks after the shutdown when the hotel was nearly empty
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:37.320]  suddenly a lot of people started coming in the street paying cash
[2:18:37.320 --> 2:18:40.600]  these are for two and three hundred dollar at night rooms
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:45.240]  and they were a lower class individual they came in and the rooms of
[2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:49.000]  hotel staff started talking about all the drug paraphernalia the needles
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:53.240]  the feces on the floor the food that was dumped on the floor it was just
[2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:57.480]  trash trash after trash these people of course
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:00.920]  would never be able to afford a hotel like this
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:04.440]  this went on for two or three weeks and finally the staff at the marriott started
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:08.200]  to call the police on these people and once the police started coming a lot of
[2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:12.120]  them started to clear out but finally the marriott
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:15.640]  staff put two and two together because the protest
[2:19:15.640 --> 2:19:19.720]  BLM protest has started at the same time these people arrived in the hotel
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:23.800]  that these were paid protesters and that's why they were all paying with cash
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:27.320]  and they're a low class type of individual they have no principles
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:31.160]  they don't care about black lives matters these people are
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:37.320]  criminals druggies and people who don't like American society they're being
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:42.600]  that's why they just they beat up women and children they shoot people at red
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:45.960]  lights and the media says it's good that's what's crazy
[2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:50.040]  is the media set the precedent to kill innocent people and then it's a good
[2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:54.280]  thing yes and you know governors have even
[2:19:54.280 --> 2:19:57.320]  said you know everyone's got to wear a mask but black lives
[2:19:57.320 --> 2:20:03.480]  matter protesters are exempt from that i mean here the people are creating the
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:08.680]  violence and the and the protest and the phony name of black lives matter are
[2:20:08.680 --> 2:20:13.400]  are being exempted from these things so let me ask you this more advice to the
[2:20:13.400 --> 2:20:15.320]  president when you come back in the final segment

[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:09.400]  all right joe scowleson at worldfirstbrief.com is our guest here
[2:24:09.400 --> 2:24:12.760]  he'll be in studio with us not this week not next week the week after
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:17.880]  we're looking forward to that as negative as as things are
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:21.880]  watching all this unfold i have to tell you that
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:25.000]  people on the street callers everybody now know
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:29.800]  it's a spiritual battle and so i see us going from this last few decades of
[2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:33.480]  people being spiritually asleep kind of living on our laurels
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:36.680]  to a great awakening so i don't want to be overly positive if you
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:39.400]  disagree joel i respect you tell me i'm wrong in your view
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:42.200]  but i just think there's a huge awakening happening
[2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:45.080]  and this whole anti-crist system and everything is about
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:49.320]  suppressing that so can you speak to any good news you have or
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:52.840]  the period in history you think we're in right now
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:56.520]  yes i can alex first of all i think that
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:01.000]  it is a small minority that is awakening and permanently so and realizing
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:05.080]  finally yes this is a conspiracy this is not justified
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:09.720]  but unfortunately the mainstream of america is buying into this covet 19
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:14.040]  because it's wall-to-wall propaganda especially focused on conservative
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:18.440]  states who really they've always wanted to subvert those
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:22.200]  but here's some really good news there are millions of parents who are
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:25.000]  deciding to home school now rather than send their
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:31.640]  kids back to school with mass exactly this is really backfired hasn't it
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:35.400]  really has this is probably one of the most important things to drive people
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:38.760]  out of the public schools why should we send to people who are public
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:41.160]  schools when they're gonna have to wear masks they're gonna have
[2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:44.840]  they don't have any social interaction they don't have anything
[2:25:44.840 --> 2:25:49.720]  and so unfortunately the states are trying to put a block on that they're
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:52.600]  trying everything they can to stop people from
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:56.360]  leaving the public school system the home school legal defense
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:00.120]  fund which is the most important lobby in the united states that needs your
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.640]  support and is fighting and emailing constantly state
[2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:09.160]  officials and school board officials telling them it's
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:13.320]  illegal to stop parents from leaving they're trying to do it
[2:26:13.320 --> 2:26:17.000]  they want it both ways they want to control and destroy the economy they
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:20.360]  want to keep people under these control agendas but they don't want them to
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:23.880]  leave and you know imagine the cult too of
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:28.680]  making them wear masks and stay six feet apart i mean this is cult brainwashing
[2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:32.520]  yeah it really is now the important thing to remember is that
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:37.400]  there's also another thing that's driving that's positive that's happening
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:40.920]  there is a wave of people alex that are leaving the cities
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:44.040]  they are realizing that's why you're coming that's why you're coming in two
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:47.960]  weeks i i feel a drive that i've never felt
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:51.400]  beyond like getting married having children i've never felt the drive to
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:55.080]  go farm and go to the country i literally it's it's i've
[2:26:55.080 --> 2:26:59.560]  never felt the pressure like this well that's right i mean i'm in
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:02.920]  rural central utah we don't have any restrictions whatsoever
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:05.880]  life is normal and a lot of people are realizing
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:09.640]  that the only place there restrictions are in high density population so what
[2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:13.240]  is that drive i'm spiritually feeling what is that
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:17.480]  well i think it's you know the lord knows that
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:21.800]  he's gonna have to let satan win because win this battle to a certain extent
[2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:25.400]  i'm not talking about the remnant he'll save a remnant but
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:29.480]  win the battle he's gonna lose the war but we got a satan that's right
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:33.080]  that's right he's got to win the battle because people don't deserve
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:36.760]  to keep their liberty when they've been dumbed down and they haven't been
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:39.800]  listening to conscience they're buying junk food they're eating
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:43.960]  lousy they're not healthy so why is my conscious telling me get out
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:48.680]  of the city now like like ordering me but because everyone
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:52.760]  who's got a sensitive conscience is is trying is getting a message from the
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:55.800]  lord to get prepared or get out of the big
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:58.840]  cities get out of the way there's only one way to avoid the surveillance
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:01.960]  trappers has to get out of the big cities where all the cameras and all the
[2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:06.200]  sensors are and there's just no other way to
[2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:10.520]  do to take but for the sake of one's children people need to get out of the
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:15.160]  public schools i don't care what it costs you do not oh who cares about the
[2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:19.240]  new car in the big house it means nothing freedom is everything
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:22.040]  so that's why you're here that's why you're here in two weeks where should i
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:25.320]  move then okay
[2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:29.160]  well you know moving is a very complex decision because it has to do with
[2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:32.600]  how far you got to travel to work which is going to limit your abilities it's
[2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:35.000]  got a you know your children if they're in private
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.680]  schools have what your church is like
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:43.320]  it's it's about our population density one of the things that i generally
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:47.560]  recommend is people need to get about an hours drive away from the major
[2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:51.080]  cities that's too far for people to walk to the bare minimum agree is get
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:54.680]  outside the big city that's first thing that's right
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:58.600]  and then you've got to get into places where you can put a basement in you
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:02.280]  can't have high security construction and concealed
[2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:05.640]  safe rooms without a basement type so you want to be in basement
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:09.080]  capable area and you want to be in someplace where you can grow because
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:11.720]  there's going to be famine after this war is coming
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:15.560]  i know we haven't been talking about war because of this phony covid crisis
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:18.520]  which is oh but look at china it's heating up
[2:29:18.520 --> 2:29:22.760]  that's right it is heating up and china this is a hundred percent
[2:29:22.760 --> 2:29:27.080]  prediction on my part there is no room for air there will be a war with russia
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:31.800]  and china and so don't let version and the inconvenience
[2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:35.560]  let covet motivate people to get out of the big cities and start getting
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:41.080]  compared to the larger feds and you could know i'm 46 years old and i've
[2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:44.360]  certainly learned to follow my gut my gut is a hundred percent
[2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:48.440]  get to the mountains grow stuff get ready get your family i mean it
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:53.160]  hammers me now we're like every second like get out get out get out get out
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:56.520]  i mean it's a thousand times what it was five years ago i mean it's like an
[2:29:56.520 --> 2:30:02.200]  order get out now leave now i've got doctors who are clients who
[2:30:02.200 --> 2:30:05.560]  realize that this vaccine is going to mandate it they're not going to take it
[2:30:05.560 --> 2:30:09.000]  their medical license is going to be on the line they're talking about
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:12.840]  how do i consolidate my finances get out of debt and get out of town before this
[2:30:12.840 --> 2:30:17.800]  happens so it's about to be a major separation
[2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:20.760]  well that's right i mean this is one of the purposes if the lord's going to
[2:30:20.760 --> 2:30:24.600]  bring down retribution on the wicked and the evil he's got to separate out
[2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:28.200]  with people exactly these cities are about to
[2:30:28.200 --> 2:30:31.640]  probably get nuked that's why god's like get out of them
[2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:35.160]  and if they're not new because the nuclear first strike will follow military
[2:30:35.160 --> 2:30:38.040]  targets only but still there's going to be a lot of follow there's going to be an
[2:30:38.040 --> 2:30:42.200]  e-m's mp strike which precedes that that's going to bring down all the
[2:30:42.200 --> 2:30:46.920]  markets all the internet you can't order anything if cash is already gone you're
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:51.720]  going to that's the order to get out of sotomega mora it's like get out now
[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:55.080]  that's right because as inconvenient it may be
[2:30:55.080 --> 2:30:59.240]  to relocate now it's going to be infinitely worse if you try to do it
[2:30:59.240 --> 2:31:02.680]  during war it's going to be infinitely worse if you wait two years if they
[2:31:02.680 --> 2:31:08.840]  was going to be impossible yeah and so we're going to talk about that on
[2:31:08.840 --> 2:31:12.680]  january on july 28th uh when i come into town and i hope
[2:31:12.680 --> 2:31:17.080]  everybody put that on their schedule i also want to mention that we talked i
[2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:19.640]  talked about the funding of black lives matter
[2:31:19.640 --> 2:31:24.680]  through the illegal use of 501c3 organizations this week's world affairs
[2:31:24.680 --> 2:31:27.400]  brief talks about that and gives all the
[2:31:27.400 --> 2:31:30.760]  evidence of how they do that funding and that's what president trump needs to
[2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:35.080]  say iris they're run by weathermen people coming
[2:31:35.080 --> 2:31:40.760]  i mean they're run by terrorists former black panthers former weathermen
[2:31:40.760 --> 2:31:43.640]  former uh domestic terrorists that are running these
[2:31:43.640 --> 2:31:47.560]  organizations but donald trump needs to know that he's got to put a special
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:51.400]  prosecutor into the iris who will do his bidding and make sure they do a proper
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:54.920]  investigation otherwise the iris is a pull of liberals is going to come back
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:31:58.760]  and say oh there's nothing wrong that's what they're doing but people can get a

[2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:47.080]  and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:50.360]  history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:54.680]  we don't appreciate the american way truth justice due process the right to

[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:06.360]  social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:10.360]  believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:14.040]  is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:17.240]  that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalist
[2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:20.920]  who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:25.160]  and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:28.680]  manipulate and command if you're even lucky enough to stay alive
[2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:34.440]  and that's what covet 19 is a global un revolution against free humanity
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:37.560]  against your family against prosperity and against your future if you don't
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:40.920]  stand up and fight you deserve what you get
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:45.320]  much of the united states bureaucracy all of hollywood and most of our media
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:49.000]  is under international banking control the united ages was set up by the
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:53.480]  roth child's rocker fellers on record to carry out this operation now under the
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:59.720]  guise of medical security they're bringing us medical charity that we see
[2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:03.160]  much of the federal government the democrats the republicans all saying
[2:36:03.160 --> 2:36:07.160]  except for trump and a few people that we need a nationwide force
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:11.080]  mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:14.440]  even though just months ago we had the surgeon you know and others say don't
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:16.760]  wear a mask it's all a fraud now they say you
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:21.400]  must wear a mask it's a sign of slavery it's a sign of submission i know you
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:24.280]  was listeners understand that we need sheriffs and county
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:27.080]  commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say
[2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:31.000]  we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:35.080]  and local sovereignty against the globalist this isn't the federal
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:38.280]  government taking over it's the un through the federal government and we
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:42.520]  as american citizens must say no i know what we'll do to make them conform to
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:45.320]  our cult we'll all tell them to wear masks or they're
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:48.680]  gonna die and then we'll release the pressure for a while and bring it back
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:51.560]  and squeeze it harder and release the kid and we'll be the virtuous
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:55.560]  second ones will be the angels even though our lord and master bill gates
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:37:03.240]  helped fund the whole covid-19 oh no don't seduce me that's right
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:08.040]  that's the code word for bill gates's operation he carries out with his good
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:14.360]  little buddy dr falchi in the surgeon cult as you know for girls there's five
[2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:18.280]  different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:22.360]  one of them is the vampire the werewolf the billionaire
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:25.800]  and and who else oh that's right there's the surgeon
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:29.320]  and then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by these
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:33.160]  psychotic psychopaths it's so good to know that there are
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:35.800]  masters and they're coming to rape us with their
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:42.120]  inoculations psychopaths are so hot oh yeah
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:48.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:38:02.680]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:09.320]  mother shot dead in st lewis and then
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:15.400]  the rest of story as black lives matter in antifa protests continue to rage
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:18.600]  across the country tensions are beginning to rise between these
[2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:22.440]  extreme groups and the average american who has grown tired of the endless
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:25.960]  destruction and chaos ravaging their city streets
[2:38:25.960 --> 2:38:29.560]  one of the most common ways we see people fighting back against black lives
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:33.800]  matter is simply with the phrase all lives matter
[2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:37.480]  unfortunately in our heightened political climate this phrase
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:40.280]  which has oftentimes been met with much controversy
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:43.880]  has led to the shooting and ultimate death of 24 year old mother
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:48.760]  jessica wittaker wittaker who leaves behind a three year old son
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:53.000]  was shot and killed in indianapolis last week by black lives matter members
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:57.320]  after uttering the phrase all lives matter according to her fiance
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:01.960]  jose Ramirez he jessica and two other friends were hanging out alongside the
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:04.760]  cannellan indianapolis when someone in their group
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:07.800]  allegedly used a slang version of the n word
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:10.840]  the word then prompted a confrontation by a group of strangers
[2:39:10.840 --> 2:39:14.600]  who began shouting black lives matter to which jessica responded
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:18.920]  all lives matter tensions became heated when the blm group brandished weapons
[2:39:18.920 --> 2:39:23.240]  prompting ramirez to do the same the groups then decided to work things out
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:26.440]  and ended up walking away after the initial confrontation
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:30.760]  however just minutes after walking away members of the blm group
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:33.800]  opened fire on jessica's group from a nearby bridge
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:37.720]  resulting in her dying from a bullet wound to the head
[2:39:37.720 --> 2:39:41.800]  jessica's sister shared that jessica did not have a racist boat in her body
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:45.720]  and since her murder blm and anti-police accounts have flooded
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:49.480]  the social media accounts of jessica and her family to smear her name
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:53.560]  and justify her killing calling her a racist and a white supremacist despite
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:57.160]  no evidence that she used any racial slur
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:01.640]  her father also pointed out that this incident happened well over a week ago
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:06.200]  during the fourth of july weekend however neither cnn nor fox news
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.640]  two of the news outlets that have been intent on sharing stories centered
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:12.760]  around race tensions have reached out to cover the story
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:16.280]  with the gateway pundit being first to bring light to the story on a national
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:19.800]  scale however this isn't the first incident of
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:23.160]  black on white hate crime the media has refused to cover
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:26.840]  as racial tension continues to rise in america amid the george floyd riots and
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:29.960]  protests many members of the white community have fallen
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:33.160]  victim to being falsely accused of racism
[2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:37.320]  and have suffered greatly as a result let's not forget this 50-year-old macy's
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:39.800]  employee who was punched in the back of the head
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:43.320]  and beaten after two men alleged that he said the n word
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:46.680]  he was on a phone call prior to the attack and recordings of the call
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:50.360]  vindicated him with the false allegations and surveillance footage
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:53.960]  also showed the suspect approaching the employee from behind and punching him in
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:57.560]  the head in an unprovoked attack countering the fake story he laid out to
[2:40:57.560 --> 2:41:01.320]  the media if the roles had been reversed and a white man was beating a black man
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:05.400]  it would be a national story for months but since that was not the case
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:08.840]  the story quickly dissipated with prosecutor sharing there was not enough
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:11.480]  evidence to charge this incidents at the hate crime
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:15.400]  let's also take a look at this pregnant woman who was harassed and threatened
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:19.640]  at a chipotle when a black teen alleged that the woman bumped into her
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:29.240]  so she did something wrong she needs to apologize this is a 15-year-old
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:32.600]  and you're on camera okay you're feeling threatened okay what's going on
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:37.880]  no mom I got this you're blocking me from getting on my ass bitch
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:41.240]  yeah I said if you say something I'll beat you up like that
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:45.480]  oh you do something please do something you're not just
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:57.640]  why would you say sorry I care about you and I'm sorry if you why did you say
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:02.120]  sorry if you bumped into her why did you say sorry no one is racing
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:05.560]  her mother then decided to call the woman and her husband a racist
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:08.120]  threatened and harassed them as they tried to drive away
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:12.360]  she then followed their car as they began backing up and slapped the vehicle
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:17.480]  resulting in the woman brandishing her weapon in an attempt to finally get away
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:20.680]  guess who was labeled a racist and has since been charged with a felonous
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:23.720]  assault that's right the pregnant woman who
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:27.960]  was carelessly labeled a racist and then harassed threatened and bullied
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:32.520]  out of not leaving the area and finally because we could really go on all day
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:36.200]  let's not forget this young 12-year-old boy who was dancing on a sidewalk
[2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:40.280]  when a grown man jumped out of his car and punched him in the back of the head
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:43.720]  in an attempt to play what seems to be the knockout game
[2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:47.640]  a game centered around finding a white victim and trying to knock them out with
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:50.440]  one punch the man is being charged with two felony
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:54.280]  assaults but no hate crime would the outcome be the same if the
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:57.960]  races were reversed and more importantly if none of those
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:03.240]  incidents of black on white threats and assaults or hate crimes then why is this
[2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:07.640]  this couple simply painted over a black lives matter slogan painted across their
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:10.680]  city and are being charged with the hate crime
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:14.600]  similarly a person hacked into a digital traffic sign and wrote all lives
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:17.320]  matter prompting their police chief and mayor
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:21.240]  to issue a sincere apology to anyone who drove by the sign
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:25.560]  in chicago citizens changed the BLM slogan to read all lives matter
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:29.480]  prompting news outlets to write about the defacing and vandalization of this
[2:43:29.480 --> 2:43:33.240]  great mural but punch falsely accused threatened and
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:35.960]  even kill a white person and you get off without the
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:40.520]  phrase hate crime even being uttered as we continue to see an immense
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:45.160]  rise in racial tensions across america the media continues to paint any
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:48.200]  counter protest to the BLM message as a hate crime
[2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:51.480]  while simultaneously ignoring the countless attacks
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:55.560]  and now murder of those who try to unify the nation through the phrase
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:43:58.760]  all lives matter this has been savannah hernandez
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:01.560]  with action seven news
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:05.720]  i regret very much what has happened about the flag
[2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:11.480]  the flag that people look at now is a flag that was carried during the
[2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:17.000]  demonstrations against civil rights it was carried by q plus clansman
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:20.360]  and all that kind of thing and that's what it represents to a great many people
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:24.360]  and i don't wonder that they're feeling pain and wanting to take it down i
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:27.880]  understand perfectly well they do that but to my mind they miss
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:33.320]  identifying that flag uh that flag represents many good things
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:36.840]  and you have to translate yourself back into the time
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:42.280]  of c-session to understand how some states should want to
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:47.640]  cc the constitution has not been amended in 61 years
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:51.400]  this was the first amendment the emancipation amendment
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:55.560]  was the first amendment in 61 years the constitution and absolutely the first
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:59.400]  amendment that ever had anything to do with anybody's private property
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:04.520]  so they saw this this amendment coming uh they said we don't want any part of
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:08.600]  this union we want to get out of it and people say slavery had nothing to do
[2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:11.560]  with the war just as wrong as people you say slavery had
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:16.120]  everything to do with the war that was a very complicated civic thing
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:18.680]  that's what you talk
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:24.280]  somebody once gave the best excuse for that war i've ever heard
[2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:29.400]  he said it was the war of one form of society against another form of society
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:33.480]  and because one of those forms of society included
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:37.800]  tribal slavery and the other side didn't accept to
[2:45:37.800 --> 2:45:43.720]  a limited extent it's always been identified as a war over slavery
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:48.360]  believe me no soldier on either side gave a damn about the slaves
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:52.040]  they were fighting for other reasons entirely in their minds
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:55.640]  southerners thought they were fighting the second american revolution
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:58.840]  northerners thought they were fighting the whole union together
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:03.400]  and that held true throughout the whole war except for some people who were
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:08.440]  absolute partisans on both sides frayers in south carolina
[2:46:08.440 --> 2:46:12.840]  and abolitionists in massachusetts southerners once said i'm fighting because
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:16.600]  you're down here if you want to invade my home you've
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:19.640]  got me to fight others say you're trying to
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:22.840]  tear the fabric of the union therefore you should be
[2:46:22.840 --> 2:46:26.920]  put down and not allowed to do what you claim you want to do
[2:46:26.920 --> 2:46:31.000]  it's a very complex subject and i'm sorry to see it
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:35.720]  degenerate into such things as identifying that flag
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:41.640]  as a symbol of racism it is not it was never intended as such
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:53.160]  confederacy respected law above all things
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:56.280]  i'm standing in this briefing room right now there is no government official
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:47:00.600]  here but i'll say uh that the press is not the enemy of the
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:12.280]  people
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:15.800]  but i'll say uh that the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:19.640]  the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:31.320]  the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:46.040]  maybe we should go out on pennsylvania avenue like these folks who chant cnn
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:50.360]  sucks and uh fake news maybe we should go out all all journalists
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:48:05.560]  should go out on pennsylvania avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:08.600]  we're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people we're not
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:17.240]  the enemy of the people
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:29.240]  this is cnn
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:33.080]  so i was taking care of an errand this morning and i wasn't even close to
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:36.920]  downtown but i was parked the whole side street going to this business
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:40.200]  when i came back out i saw what looked like two
[2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:45.000]  asian folks probably chinese walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:48.520]  ahead of me and here i am parked a truck with the windows up
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:51.800]  and the woman stops and points at me so they stop
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:55.240]  and they wait while i'm inside my truck truck started and
[2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:58.680]  they sit there and stretch keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:04.120]  like they're waiting for me to go because i'm not wearing a mask inside
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:07.800]  my car and so then i just sat there so they acted
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:13.000]  angry and walked past me i almost shot a video of it on my phone but
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.960]  everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere this is mental illness people
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:19.240]  are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks
[2:49:19.240 --> 2:49:22.200]  this is all cult programming this is all about submitting
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:26.440]  we cannot submit to this un brainwashing it's all a giant fraud
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:31.080]  we must expose the fraud or become slaves to it
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:34.600]  a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to
[2:49:34.600 --> 2:49:39.000]  those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:42.840]  phones how programmed master computers would
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:47.160]  manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict
[2:49:47.160 --> 2:49:50.200]  large groups of human movements and activities but even
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:53.160]  predict what individuals would do and then once you could predict what
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:56.680]  individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli
[2:49:56.680 --> 2:50:01.160]  through the ai systems through the computers through digital billboards
[2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:04.040]  through face scanning through the social credit score
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:08.280]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to but when we cover that
[2:50:08.280 --> 2:50:11.880]  the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:16.280]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents
[2:50:16.280 --> 2:50:20.120]  well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:23.160]  setting up this control system to make humans obsolete
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:26.840]  and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:32.120]  than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:38.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:52.920]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:56.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:51:01.880]  and now your host john rapaport
[2:51:08.680 --> 2:51:13.560]  we're here we're here and we're live and this is
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:21.720]  the story the story keeps getting crazier as you no doubt understand
[2:51:21.720 --> 2:51:28.440]  just listening to alex there i remember back in 1987 i said
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:33.560]  the medical cartel is the most dangerous cartel in the world
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:39.400]  because they fly no political banner they say we're healers that's it we're
[2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:43.160]  neutral we just want to help
[2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:47.320]  and then they tell their story very convincingly and they have tremendous
[2:51:47.320 --> 2:51:52.120]  access of course through media which they've cultivated i'll talk about that
[2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:54.520]  in a minute
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:52:01.640]  and people sign on they salute they bow down they kneel they enlist they go for
[2:52:01.640 --> 2:52:05.960]  that story but then what happens eventually
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:09.480]  is what we're seeing now
[2:52:10.680 --> 2:52:15.560]  the medical cartel says well now you must do this
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:21.800]  because of this threat and it's never worked before but now thanks to the
[2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:25.800]  chinese regime and bill gates and other players
[2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:32.280]  it is working in terms of the lockdowns which is i will say for the
[2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:36.760]  hundredth time the whole point of the exercise
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:43.400]  and the destruction the lockdowns the shutdowns the closing of businesses the
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:49.880]  closing of schools the ending of businesses and incomes
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:55.480]  and jobs the engine of the country and the world
[2:52:55.480 --> 2:53:02.120]  comes to a stop in many respects that's the operation
[2:53:02.120 --> 2:53:06.280]  how do you sell it well you sell it
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:11.640]  medically that's how you sell it you think you're going to sell it by saying
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:15.400]  carl marx out loud
[2:53:15.400 --> 2:53:21.080]  or london out loud or hitler out loud or a mao out loud
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:26.360]  or musolini out loud of course not
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:32.680]  you're going to sell it through we're here to do good
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:38.840]  we are the coronavirus task force which by the way
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:43.880]  how did that whole thing start i've still not been able to find out
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:47.400]  i see stories about it
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:52.200]  one story in fact says the state department was actually
[2:53:52.200 --> 2:53:57.560]  the founder you can believe that the relevance
[2:53:57.560 --> 2:54:01.800]  how many people of hillary were still there when that happened
[2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:05.960]  if that happened another story goes
[2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:10.600]  that once the coronavirus task force of the white house had been established
[2:54:10.600 --> 2:54:17.640]  get this republican senators actually came to trump and they said
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:22.600]  we think the face of this task force should be tony fowker
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:28.680]  republican senate why well tony's a good guy and he's got a lot of respect in
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:33.480]  the medical community he's been at nih for god knows 50 years
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:38.200]  now whatever it is he's your guy
[2:54:38.200 --> 2:54:44.280]  and so it came to pass does anybody to look at the background of this guy
[2:54:44.280 --> 2:54:48.440]  to see who he's connected to like bill gates for example
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:57.080]  apparently not apparently it's just okay fow cheese the guy fow cheese the man
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:55:03.480]  and so now we have this situation
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:10.520]  behavior control social credit score must wear a mask
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:16.360]  must have social distancing even if this were a real epidemic which it's not
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:19.720]  it's totally fake right from the beginning
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:24.280]  those measures would do nothing to stop it and yet
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:28.920]  you've got billions of people saluting the medical
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:33.720]  cartel that's how powerful this cartel is
[2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:38.440]  in fact after the break there's a whole lot more
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:41.800]  whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:46.200]  or not the globalist controllers do and they constantly write about and talk
[2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:51.320]  about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:55.320]  that force humans to quote evolve in a new better way
[2:55:55.320 --> 2:55:58.680]  now when you study how they actually want you to evolve you believe in that
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:01.800]  it is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:05.640]  and a post-human future talk about psychotic talk about creepy
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:09.720]  talk about crazy but they need an event like cova 19
[2:56:09.720 --> 2:56:14.680]  to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose over its breathing tubes
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:17.800]  to set the precedent for the forced inoculations
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:22.280]  for the gmo for the 5g and for all the things that they admit will
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:25.400]  end our humanity as we know it that's why this is so evil
[2:56:25.400 --> 2:56:29.720]  their whole agenda for cashless society global government
[2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:34.200]  you in control getting us all into debt getting rid of local government
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:53.560]  think about all the fast and some of the censorship the surveillance
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:58.360]  so let's talk now about the florida hustle
[2:56:58.360 --> 2:57:05.080]  as you know and it's been posted at info wars in other places now
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:12.280]  22 labs in florida reported on coronavirus testing
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:19.080]  100 positive for covid which is of course completely insane
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:23.560]  impossible doesn't work etc etc
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:31.000]  this is how much they need to fake the numbers
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:37.080]  this is how much how desperate they are to fake the case numbers the death
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:40.280]  numbers the whole thing which tells you that what they're
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:45.320]  basically selling is a story because if this really were
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:50.280]  some kind of virus unlike anything we've ever seen
[2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:55.320]  that just cuts people down left and right all over the world and spreads
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:57:59.240]  beyond the possibility of any rational containment
[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:05.160]  they wouldn't be needing to do this it would be completely irrelevant and
[2:58:05.160 --> 2:58:09.160]  absurd because the facts would be clear you would be
[2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:13.560]  seeing in your town or your city wherever you
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.480]  live dead bodies everywhere it wouldn't be
[2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:22.600]  oh we have to go into the hospital you know you just be seeing people
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:27.960]  crumbling and falling and dying everywhere which is not the case
[2:58:27.960 --> 2:58:34.280]  not even close so they have to inflate and invent and concoct
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:38.120]  and manufacture out of thin air these crazy case numbers
[2:58:38.120 --> 2:58:44.680]  so that they can sell the story about a virus that's what's actually going on
[2:58:44.680 --> 2:58:51.560]  but at the same time i have to tell you on a much more sinister level
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:56.600]  what's happening in florida is what intelligence agencies would call a
[2:58:56.600 --> 2:59:02.760]  limited hangout and that's where you admit to a
[2:59:02.760 --> 2:59:07.960]  mistake or even a crime in order to cover the
[2:59:07.960 --> 2:59:12.200]  much larger crime because then everybody
[2:59:12.200 --> 2:59:16.760]  satisfies you look at what happened in florida these idiots
[2:59:16.760 --> 2:59:21.560]  how could they possibly some kind of uh
[2:59:21.560 --> 2:59:27.720]  you know a computer glitch uh we don't know what it was and the
[2:59:27.720 --> 2:59:31.000]  programming went crazy you're seeing on the screen
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:36.520]  other labs are doing the same thing not just in florida
[2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:44.200]  concocting numbers but it gives the public an opportunity to say
[2:59:44.200 --> 2:59:48.840]  these people are incompetent and it's terrible and we have to fix the problem
[2:59:48.840 --> 2:59:52.520]  and then the cdc waltzes in and says yes indeed
[2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:56.840]  and we're investigating and we're going to fix this problem because
[2:59:56.840 --> 3:00:02.920]  we as the cdc must get the numbers right otherwise we can't give good advice
[3:00:02.920 --> 3:00:08.120]  to tony fouchi and the crew as to what to do
[3:00:08.120 --> 3:00:11.880]  and then the public sits back and they say okay i'm glad
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:15.480]  that's out of the way i mean yeah there's incompetent people everywhere and
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:19.720]  they're crazy but you know all in all this is okay
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:24.200]  this is correct no it isn't the whole thing's a lie you see but you always
[3:00:24.200 --> 3:00:28.360]  need a limited hangout
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:34.680]  because the roofs and the yokels fall for the limited hangout which is the
[3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:39.800]  partial confession of a partial mistake or a crime
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:43.080]  in order to hide the much bigger crime which is
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:47.320]  this is not about a virus at all never was since the beginning
[3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:52.440]  okay it's all faked it's a story they're selling
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:57.000]  tests make no sense whatsoever because they're testing for something
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  that isn't there to begin with but it can read as if
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:08.200]  something is there so all the numbers are meaningless
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:14.040]  now we're getting to the heart of the crime from a medical level
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:19.960]  so once in a while there will be a scandal it'll be exposed etc etc etc
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:24.600]  and then everybody will say okay well there are ideas everywhere and now
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:31.240]  thank goodness uh this is all dealt with and handled
[3:01:31.240 --> 3:01:40.440]  no it isn't not whatsoever not whatsoever not in the slightest
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:45.240]  i've gone over the story maybe a hundred times of what happened in 2009
[3:01:45.240 --> 3:01:51.160]  with this wine flu pandemic in heavy quotes because i've been at this for
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:56.280]  30 years now investigating fake epidemics
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:02.680]  and in 2009 the cdc itself was saying that there were thousands of cases
[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:07.560]  and eventually they said millions of cases of swine flu in america
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:13.960]  when the truth was that almost all of the test samples from patients
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:19.480]  were coming back from labs with no sign of swine flu or any other kind of
[3:02:19.480 --> 3:02:21.720]  flu
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:27.560]  now you begin to see the actual scope of the crime
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:32.920]  and so sharyl atkinson who was a star investigative reporter at cbs at the
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:36.280]  time uncovered that whole story i interviewed her
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:43.560]  subsequently and she played it out to me how she actually exposed this
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:46.920]  wrote an article it was posted on the cbs
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:52.120]  news site and then the whole thing was shut down
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:03:00.200]  would not go any further and no other major media outlets in the world
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:03.480]  not just in the country but the world picked up on her story
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:08.200]  and ran with it and you're seeing that headline on the screen which is the
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:14.120]  original article that she wrote cbs in 2009
[3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:19.240]  three weeks after that article the cdc came out
[3:03:19.240 --> 3:03:23.400]  decided to tell a much bigger lie and said they estimated that at
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:30.280]  peak swine flu infections in the united states were 22
[3:03:30.280 --> 3:03:32.760]  million
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:38.200]  you know what happened in the florida hustle that i just described
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:44.760]  is nothing compared to that now we're talking about a sensational crime
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:50.120]  because essentially the whole swine flu epidemic was a hoax
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:55.560]  and yet people took and were injured very seriously by this wine flu
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:03:59.400]  vaccine which tony fouchy by the way at the time
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:04.040]  said was going to be very safe and effective
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:08.200]  he's the guy heading up the coronavirus task force
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:14.760]  and as you can see now the basically the medical cartel and the
[3:04:14.760 --> 3:04:19.560]  political left are desperate to shore up his reputation
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:24.200]  there are now massive tweets going on about
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:28.360]  we stand by fouchy the american medical association has come out
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:35.880]  in support of fouchy i've been writing articles non-stop about fouchy
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:41.960]  and trump and how this was a marriage made in hell
[3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:49.800]  and it is it was and it is and it will be as long as it lasts
[3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:55.800]  and we're going to need to get into trump which i'm going to do
[3:04:55.800 --> 3:05:03.080]  the next segment because it's not enough to say as some people do well
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:07.240]  what looks like every weak move that trump is making
[3:05:07.240 --> 3:05:11.400]  is actually a deception it's really a strong move
[3:05:11.400 --> 3:05:16.280]  and we are all going to see it play out eventually
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:24.360]  when he does a complete turnabout and you know the world is saved
[3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:29.160]  okay there's a lot of people who seem to believe that
[3:05:29.880 --> 3:05:34.200]  but you see eventually you can't keep saying
[3:05:34.200 --> 3:05:40.120]  off the top of your head that every weak move that a president is making is
[3:05:40.120 --> 3:05:43.880]  actually a strong move it just doesn't work
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:48.440]  you have to face what that president is doing head on
[3:05:48.440 --> 3:05:53.320]  and you have to say whether you support him basically or you don't support him
[3:05:53.320 --> 3:06:00.680]  but something different has to happen because as the show is playing out now
[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:06.120]  it's incredible amounts of economic and human devastation
[3:06:06.120 --> 3:06:12.040]  that are occurring that are not being covered by the press
[3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:17.720]  not being highlighted by the press and because of that
[3:06:17.720 --> 3:06:22.200]  there is still this kind of fairy tale at work in the society
[3:06:22.200 --> 3:06:26.200]  that yes you know there's some shutdowns and
[3:06:26.200 --> 3:06:30.680]  we're trying to reopen the economy now and it's going to get better
[3:06:30.680 --> 3:06:36.040]  and that's not the true story at all
[3:06:37.480 --> 3:06:42.200]  imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020
[3:06:42.200 --> 3:06:45.400]  the democrats as well as many republican leaders will be calling
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:51.160]  for the united nations WHO edict that all americans wear masks
[3:06:51.160 --> 3:06:57.400]  be a quote federal order and mandate totally unconstitutional
[3:06:57.400 --> 3:07:02.680]  annihilating states rights think about that a woman can kill her baby
[3:07:02.680 --> 3:07:07.480]  we pay for illegal aliens health care but you've got to wear a mask
[3:07:07.480 --> 3:07:11.720]  for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said
[3:07:11.720 --> 3:07:16.120]  even if you believe the official story this is about the WHO the globalist
[3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:19.320]  testing their power through the media over the federal
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:23.080]  government to set policy in the united states this is our
[3:07:23.080 --> 3:07:26.520]  punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the
[3:07:26.520 --> 3:07:29.480]  parents accord and all of it and by the way they admit that
[3:07:29.480 --> 3:07:33.320]  they say now your carbon's down one way or another
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:38.600]  you stupid americans one of the best nutrients nature has provided

[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:44.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:58.360 --> 3:09:05.240]  on the road again just came back on the road again let's look at the education
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:08.600]  system
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:14.120]  all over the country governors are deciding how they're going to cook this
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:19.160]  particular chicken as schools are supposed to reopen
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:23.000]  now as we all know the public education system
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:27.240]  was already in a shambles so it's not like we're talking about saving
[3:09:27.240 --> 3:09:32.360]  paradise here but in a state like north carolina
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:36.120]  for example they've got a system which nobody
[3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:40.120]  can understand there's a plan a a plan b and a plan c
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:43.960]  and the governor saying well we might choose part of plan a and some
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:48.600]  c or if that doesn't work as we go we might do b
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:54.920]  and what they're basically talking about is how to maintain
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:10:01.400]  social distancing in schools which they can't do because they don't have enough
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:05.880]  space you can't have 10 kids in a class
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:09.000]  with the school buildings the same size as they are now so they're going to have
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  split sessions imagine what this is going to look
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:16.840]  like some kids will go to school two days a week and
[3:10:16.840 --> 3:10:22.280]  then do online education at home three days
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:25.960]  then the next week those same kids will go to school
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:30.120]  three days and do online education at home two days
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:33.720]  so they'll split the school population in half
[3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:37.400]  that's kind of what they're looking at
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:43.640]  so this will be complete madness because these kids are not going to be able to
[3:10:43.640 --> 3:10:48.360]  learn at home for a number of reasons which
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:52.200]  we don't need to go into but it's obvious the whole gates
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:55.640]  bill gates system of education through computer learning
[3:10:55.640 --> 3:11:01.560]  children is a farce it's ridiculous at the best
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:06.360]  it's just simple mind control that's all it's teaching values and so forth
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:11.240]  because a kid cannot learn by looking at a machine
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:15.400]  when his mind or her mind is not sufficiently already developed
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:18.920]  you cannot sit there for hours which is what
[3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:23.160]  these governors are talking about oh yes this is going to be a complete
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:27.560]  education system the kids are going to be sitting there for five or six hours
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:31.640]  at their computers and doing online classes
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:37.240]  sure they are sure they're going to be absorbing all of this
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:44.360]  the feedback the human contact the teacher asking questions
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:48.040]  the old-time teacher writing on the blackboard
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:52.840]  asking kids okay so what's the answer let's see it let's see your
[3:11:52.840 --> 3:11:58.360]  work okay let's go over this now this math problem
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:06.120]  let's get the steps right here engaging minds
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:10.120]  showing kids that they can actually do something
[3:12:10.120 --> 3:12:16.360]  and succeed at it we're a human teacher and i'm talking from some experience
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:19.560]  because i used to teach school
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:27.960]  the teacher tells the student you got it you did it that's right
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:33.320]  you learned the lesson you succeeded
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:40.680]  i taught you how to do this it was in your book the same steps to the problem
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:45.320]  you figured it out i gave you an example you worked it out you got the right
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:50.520]  answer very good now the student feels a little
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:57.720]  jolt of pleasure uh intellectual pleasure hey i have
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:04.440]  a mind i can think i have ability i'm capable let's go on to the next thing
[3:13:04.440 --> 3:13:08.440]  because now i feel like maybe i can do that one too
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:12.920]  so things get a little bit harder you go over another example the teacher
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:15.720]  you understand the process that i'm talking about here
[3:13:15.720 --> 3:13:23.320]  there's no replacement for that a machine doesn't do that
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:27.640]  i don't care how sophisticated the ai becomes
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:34.280]  it's still ai people still know the difference between
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:38.120]  a conversation with a human and a conversation
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:44.360]  with a piece of software and the intricacies of having a conversation
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:49.000]  with a human child in the process of learning
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:55.960]  is something that a teacher hopefully figures out how to do
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:01.080]  successfully it's not something you can learn in school
[3:14:01.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  you go into the fire and you learn it on the job
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:14.120]  that's the way it works and when you can do it you're a treasure
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:22.200]  as a teacher and students will love because they will say
[3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:27.400]  well maybe i'm not really applying mathematics these days i'm certainly not
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:30.760]  applying plane geometry to life every day
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:38.600]  no but that course taught me how to think it taught me how to
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:47.320]  reason and do logic and i proved to myself that i could do it
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:53.240]  and with the teacher's help i got over the help
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:58.840]  that's worth something that's been lost
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:04.280]  for many children tragically already and now to take this step further and
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:07.960]  destroy whatever fragment is left of that system of
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:12.520]  education in this country public education
[3:15:12.520 --> 3:15:15.960]  is a complete catastrophe and it's on purpose
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:22.120]  believe me the entire covert operation is on purpose
[3:15:23.400 --> 3:15:27.480]  to say to a child who is eight years old
[3:15:27.480 --> 3:15:30.520]  now you're going to go to school two days a week and they're going to cram your
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:35.400]  head full of whatever they do as you're sitting six feet apart
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:40.360]  from every other student and thinking that you might catch a germ that could
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:45.400]  injure you or kill you then you're going to come home for three days a week and
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:49.320]  you're going to sit in your room or in the kitchen
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:56.120]  in front of a computer uh and you're going to study five six
[3:15:56.120 --> 3:15:59.880]  hours a day the other days of the week
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:08.920]  preposterous absolutely insane and preposterous never going to happen
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:13.960]  the whole system is going to crash not just in north carolina as i've been
[3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:17.960]  talking about but in new york and california and every single state
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:21.960]  that tries this which is going to be as far as i can see every state
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:27.560]  it's going to completely crash it's not going to work
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:33.720]  and so you're going to have kids who are now looking for
[3:16:33.720 --> 3:16:41.000]  something else whatever that is video games a cause to
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:45.800]  believe in a way to annoy and irritate their parents
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:53.240]  24 7 drugs etc etc
[3:16:53.240 --> 3:16:59.560]  more than now a lot more than now it's already bad enough but it's nothing

[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:29.000]  come on it's complete crap never going to happen

[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:36.760]  other systems just don't compare the reasons that the globalist launch
[3:19:36.760 --> 3:19:40.360]  this planetary lockdown the number one reason is it serves
[3:19:40.360 --> 3:19:45.160]  every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes
[3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:49.880]  many times here on air the cashless society the surveillance system
[3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:53.320]  global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[3:19:53.320 --> 3:19:56.920]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:20:03.240]  obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation
[3:20:03.240 --> 3:20:08.040]  computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[3:20:08.040 --> 3:20:13.640]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into
[3:20:13.640 --> 3:20:17.960]  it's been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely
[3:20:17.960 --> 3:20:21.160]  predatory and through governmental actuaries and
[3:20:21.160 --> 3:20:25.960]  tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all
[3:20:25.960 --> 3:20:30.840]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power
[3:20:30.840 --> 3:20:35.880]  this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:56.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:56.440 --> 3:21:03.880]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host
[3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:08.440]  john grab a board
[3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:13.720]  just a couple more things here about education before we move on
[3:21:13.720 --> 3:21:21.720]  one is the parents are going to change their tune very quickly
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:26.120]  there's a lot of these parents that are defending the distancing the masks the
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:31.480]  whole deal they're buying into the insanity
[3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:36.440]  completely but wait till they see what happens
[3:21:36.440 --> 3:21:39.960]  when their kids are at home two days a week and then three days a week and
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:45.160]  this happens for the entire school year and the governors are promising
[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:48.360]  this is really going to be education now
[3:21:48.360 --> 3:21:53.480]  yeah we messed up last semester maybe but now this is really going to work
[3:21:53.480 --> 3:21:58.120]  and it isn't going to work it's going to be a complete disaster
[3:21:58.120 --> 3:22:03.800]  what are the parents going to do then they're going to change their tune
[3:22:04.680 --> 3:22:10.360]  they're going to begin to see how they've been hustled and con
[3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:15.400]  and how they've conned themselves by believing basically
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:23.640]  in the whole covid scam to begin with and how they're buying into the insanity
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:27.880]  watching on the screen during the break you saw all these headlines about
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:30.840]  nursing homes i've gone on this before
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:37.160]  covid-19 is killing old people that's what it is because if you really
[3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:41.160]  subtract the deaths that are happening
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:45.960]  forced premature early deaths of the elderly
[3:22:45.960 --> 3:22:49.800]  in the nursing homes in other long-term facilities
[3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:58.360]  in hospitals in their lonely apartments isolated from the outside cut off
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:04.040]  quarantined terrified by the covid diagnosis
[3:23:04.040 --> 3:23:08.520]  already having had multiple long-term medical conditions
[3:23:08.520 --> 3:23:14.840]  treated with a variety of toxic drugs they die early they're counted as
[3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:20.040]  covid deaths if you were to take all of that
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:23.560]  and move it aside and say this has nothing to do
[3:23:23.560 --> 3:23:30.280]  with a virus or any of that fakery in the covid story
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:34.120]  it's just plain murder and killing
[3:23:34.600 --> 3:23:38.680]  the inflated fake case numbers of this so-called pandemic
[3:23:38.680 --> 3:23:43.880]  would be exposed in half an hour and everybody would see the truth
[3:23:43.880 --> 3:23:51.240]  and it would be over completely over that's why the governors
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:55.960]  have to keep feeding these old people into nursing homes
[3:23:55.960 --> 3:24:01.320]  to up the kill rate to up the premature death rate to up the murder rate
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:06.520]  to up the covid case a number rate
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:13.560]  i've quoted this before on the show here if you took people in new york city
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:19.640]  age 65 and older who are labeled as covid deaths
[3:24:19.640 --> 3:24:25.880]  that would account for 73.6 percent of the covid deaths
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:29.720]  all the covid deaths in new york city
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:34.840]  what else do you need to know
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:41.160]  again this is how they have to squeeze out the numbers
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:46.200]  if there was an actual virus that was sweeping through the land
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:51.480]  killing people indiscriminately left and right and so on and so forth
[3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:57.480]  if that fantasy were actually real none of this that i'm describing would be
[3:24:57.480 --> 3:25:00.280]  necessary at all
[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:05.000]  somebody like tony fowch you could just get on television and say look around
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:09.160]  you bodies are falling everywhere
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:16.200]  not the case not happen never was isn't gonna
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:20.600]  unless somebody decides to use a chemical weapon
[3:25:22.840 --> 3:25:29.720]  okay so now trump and fowch you
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:42.360]  there comes a point when the courage of the person
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.960]  comes into question
[3:25:46.440 --> 3:25:53.880]  you could have acted sooner mr trump a lot sooner a lot more decisively
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:26:00.280]  but every day that you let pass and didn't it became harder to take a
[3:26:00.280 --> 3:26:04.520]  decisive action isn't that really true sir
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:10.680]  doesn't that always happen to people in any walk of life
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:15.480]  the longer you retreat from the situation
[3:26:15.480 --> 3:26:20.280]  the harder it is to do anything about it if you eventually decide to do
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:25.000]  something such as get rid of fowch you
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:31.080]  i don't mean attempt to minimize his presence somewhat
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:37.480]  or anything like that i mean fire the man get rid of him
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:43.320]  he's off the task force he isn't presenting data on television
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:49.160]  yes he has a civil service job still at the national institutes of health
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:56.920]  and apparently that job is secure but as far as informing the nation
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:02.520]  and giving the man complete access to the public
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:11.960]  on every major network gone done could have happened right at the beginning
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:15.960]  when trump saw the handwriting on the wall
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:20.920]  assuming he saw it when fowch he came to him
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:27.080]  and other people of that ilk and said we have a prediction out of england now
[3:27:27.080 --> 3:27:30.680]  that two million people will die in the us
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:36.440]  from covid and you mr president if you don't follow all the lockdown
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:41.960]  recommendations those deaths will be on your head
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:50.280]  if at that point he said stop the music now we have to investigate
[3:27:50.280 --> 3:27:54.680]  this whole situation we have to take another look at fowky
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:58.920]  we have to take a look at this British guy Neil Ferguson
[3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:02.920]  i've been through this several times on the show already
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:08.360]  we have to find out if this is real or fake and of course it's completely fake
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:12.440]  as i've detailed many times the whole thing
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:17.000]  was a setup and a put-up job and a con and a hustle
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:21.080]  that resulted in the lockdowns in america and in england
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:24.920]  england and other countries and the widespread fantastic
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:29.160]  economic destruction all over the planet
[3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:33.160]  the human destruction the suicides and murders
[3:28:33.160 --> 3:28:37.160]  the alcoholism the drug abuse the violence and families
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:41.640]  the splitting up of families the bankruptcies of businesses
[3:28:41.640 --> 3:28:45.240]  the closing of businesses the firing of people
[3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:51.000]  the emptying out of bank accounts all all all on and on the destruction of
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:55.880]  the education system keep going keep going keep
[3:28:55.880 --> 3:29:00.440]  going on and on there was a point at which
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:08.760]  Trump could have said fowky you've made a terrible mistake
[3:29:08.760 --> 3:29:12.680]  by trying to put two million deaths on my head
[3:29:12.680 --> 3:29:18.280]  that will never happen because the man who's predicting this
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:24.120]  is a charlatan and a fake and we've looked at this track record
[3:29:24.120 --> 3:29:31.480]  which apparently you haven't and you try to foist this on me
[3:29:32.440 --> 3:29:39.640]  that's unforgivable you're done and then trump would have gone before the
[3:29:39.640 --> 3:29:47.800]  nation and said that and backed it up with his own
[3:29:47.800 --> 3:29:55.000]  courage and by the way would have had many highly credentialed doctors
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:30:02.760]  and scientists to back them up they're out there now
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:09.080]  they just can't get access to the degree that fowky can
[3:30:09.080 --> 3:30:16.040]  that would have been trumps moment to turn this whole thing around
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:20.680]  and because he didn't because he couldn't because he wouldn't
[3:30:20.680 --> 3:30:24.520]  because he didn't see through it whatever
[3:30:24.520 --> 3:30:30.360]  was the case this is where we are now and there's more
[3:30:30.360 --> 3:30:38.360]  after the break it's finally here introducing the new survival shield
[3:30:38.360 --> 3:30:47.000]  x2 spray available now for 33 off at infowarstore.com listeners
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:51.400]  have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray
[3:30:51.400 --> 3:30:56.440]  made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine

[3:31:33.960 --> 3:31:36.520]  a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years
[3:31:36.520 --> 3:31:41.400]  and if you go back to those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking
[3:31:41.400 --> 3:31:45.720]  of cell phones how programmed master computers would
[3:31:45.720 --> 3:31:50.040]  manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict
[3:31:50.040 --> 3:31:53.080]  large groups of human movements and activities but even
[3:31:53.080 --> 3:31:56.040]  predict what individuals would do and then once you could predict what
[3:31:56.040 --> 3:31:59.560]  individuals were going to be doing you could add stimuli
[3:31:59.560 --> 3:32:04.040]  through the ai systems through the computers through digital billboards
[3:32:04.040 --> 3:32:06.920]  through face scanning through the social credit score
[3:32:06.920 --> 3:32:11.160]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to but when we cover that
[3:32:11.160 --> 3:32:14.760]  the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[3:32:14.760 --> 3:32:19.160]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents
[3:32:19.160 --> 3:32:23.000]  well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are
[3:32:23.000 --> 3:32:26.040]  setting up this control system to make humans obsolete
[3:32:26.040 --> 3:32:29.720]  and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier
[3:32:29.720 --> 3:32:34.600]  than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:38.280]  one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out
[3:32:38.280 --> 3:32:41.800]  for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are
[3:32:41.800 --> 3:32:45.080]  organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and i
[3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:47.400]  want those of you that haven't experienced living defense

[3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:17.720]  and then every day when i kept hearing you and doctor group and those
[3:33:17.720 --> 3:33:20.680]  commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living

[3:33:30.280 --> 3:33:34.840]  my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[3:33:34.840 --> 3:33:38.040]  cool that under the mega opolis technocracy plan
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:42.360]  things are going to be so incredibly fair and wonderful because
[3:33:42.360 --> 3:33:47.720]  at all seeing all loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide
[3:33:47.720 --> 3:33:51.880]  who gets what resources who gets what jobs but in reality it's building a
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:56.120]  post human world so that you can be made obsolete
[3:33:56.120 --> 3:34:00.440]  domesticated dumbed down drugged distracted
[3:34:00.440 --> 3:34:06.840]  atomized and then slowly killed this is the brave new world
[3:34:06.840 --> 3:34:11.560]  it's the post human world it's the dreaming of the post human world the
[3:34:11.560 --> 3:34:15.480]  wired magazine in the wall street journal all tell us about it
[3:34:15.480 --> 3:34:18.760]  oh now they tell us our smartphones don't just track her every move
[3:34:18.760 --> 3:34:23.240]  they're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:27.080]  globally you see the bear trap closed on our
[3:34:27.080 --> 3:34:30.360]  leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes and
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:35.960]  is explaining to us how he's slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:55.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:34:59.880]  last segment here so of course on the school
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:04.360]  situation home schooling is the answer
[3:35:04.360 --> 3:35:07.080]  always was
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:13.640]  thing is parents have to be able to do it it's not like ah yeah well home
[3:35:13.640 --> 3:35:18.840]  school you gotta be able to do it you gotta have the plan
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:24.040]  gotta implement the plan you've got to have
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:31.560]  home schooling and everything that that entails but it is worth the effort
[3:35:31.560 --> 3:35:37.560]  believe me if you can pull it off it is definitely worth the effort
[3:35:37.560 --> 3:35:44.280]  because you can educate a child which is priceless
[3:35:44.280 --> 3:35:48.280]  okay trump
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:54.440]  so this week at no more fake news i'm posting
[3:35:54.440 --> 3:35:59.240]  five articles that i wrote called dispatches from the war
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:03.480]  to trump specifically talking to the man
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:06.280]  to the president
[3:36:07.720 --> 3:36:13.240]  and in a several of those articles what i'm saying is
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:20.280]  break posse comma taught us i know the dangers
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:26.600]  they are huge fundamentally the danger of military dictatorship
[3:36:26.600 --> 3:36:33.480]  no question about it but look at the level of economic and human destruction
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:38.600]  that has already been taking place we have been invaded
[3:36:38.600 --> 3:36:42.840]  this is a war this is not something else
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:52.280]  this is a war and the country is losing the war
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:57.640]  it isn't just on the beach heads on the shores it's throughout the entire
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:01.720]  country the invasion has already taken
[3:37:01.720 --> 3:37:07.960]  place to destroy the economy it's like
[3:37:07.960 --> 3:37:12.280]  remember the stories about the neutron bomb
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:17.720]  this was a radiation device you would set it off
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:23.000]  wipes out all the people leaves the buildings stand
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:26.440]  that's the kind of war i'm talking about
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:31.400]  but it's being done through the economy through the lockdowns
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:37.400]  through psychological warfare through robotizing the population with the
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:42.600]  masks and the distancing but i gotta really
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:47.800]  press this home people the economic destruction
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:51.800]  just because you're not seeing it on the nightly news
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:55.640]  or played up in huge terms everywhere you look
[3:37:55.640 --> 3:37:59.320]  does not mean it's not happening
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:04.600]  where are the major television news
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:15.000]  coverages every night of new york city desolate city of other major cities
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:18.360]  where you go with a camera and you walk down the streets and there's nobody
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:21.080]  there and you go down into the subways and they're
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:24.120]  virtually empty
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:33.320]  and what's behind that you think what's behind that is just
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:37.720]  oh well there's a whole lot of it middle-class workers at home doing their
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:41.800]  job come on i don't have to tell you that that's
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:44.600]  just a fiction
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:50.120]  there's people starving to death can't get work
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:54.280]  on the verge of completely exploding or they have exploded already
[3:38:54.280 --> 3:39:01.880]  not from any virus from the lockdowns from the economic destruction
[3:39:01.880 --> 3:39:07.880]  so the war against the people is already in progress
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:11.480]  president trump in case you haven't noticed
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:16.440]  or in case you don't want to highlight that in your press conferences
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:21.560]  which you should in great detail to show the american people
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:26.600]  what's happening and then you should invade
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:34.120]  invade using the army or the fbi
[3:39:34.120 --> 3:39:38.520]  35 000 people work for the fbi they can all be empowered
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:46.520]  whatever to go into states and force open the economy
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:53.080]  permanently all the way open with no restraint no restriction
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:58.680]  whatsoever on the people on their liberty
[3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:06.040]  on their person on their freedom to survive to make a living
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:14.840]  to exist to be not crazy but to be
[3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:18.040]  responsible citizens
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:27.000]  invade these governors are saying yeah we're reopening reopening reopening
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:30.600]  but guess what all of a sudden
[3:40:31.080 --> 3:40:36.280]  as i said some time ago they're going to be conditions
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:41.400]  oh yes the restaurants you can only have a half mast or 10 people
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:49.640]  you know schools all of this and everybody's got to wear a mask in public
[3:40:49.640 --> 3:40:56.040]  invade force open the economies
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:41:00.120]  override the governors
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:05.320]  force the economy to open and business to zoom
[3:41:05.320 --> 3:41:11.160]  completely openly fully with no restraint no restriction
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:17.480]  no distancing forget it restaurants packed bars packed
[3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:25.320]  sports arena is packed forget it do it because
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:31.240]  aside from the fake case numbers that they will try to pull
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:38.440]  the effects will be nil zero zilch and then everybody will see the whole
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:43.000]  thing was funny that's why they're so desperate to keep
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:49.880]  the iron claw in there in your guts because they're terrified
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:55.320]  that freedom is going to prove that this whole thing was fake to begin
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:01.160]  just the way it was in canada with sarge when they said
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:05.320]  oh magically after all the quarantining in this area
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:09.320]  of the whole thing went away the virus went away and the next week
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:13.960]  the Rolling Stones played an outdoor concert with 500 000 people standing
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:18.040]  cheek to jowl outside
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:26.440]  and nothing happened no untoward effect whatsoever viruses
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:31.320]  don't just go away like so if that virus had been at all harmful
[3:42:31.320 --> 3:42:35.480]  you would have seen all kinds of people getting sick and nothing happened
[3:42:35.480 --> 3:42:40.440]  same would be true here this is the point that i've been trying to make
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:45.960]  over and over and over again 150 different friggin ways since the
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:52.440]  beginning if you ran a test that was real and said okay
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:57.560]  in Cincinnati we're opening up everything
[3:42:57.560 --> 3:43:01.240]  and we're not going to stand for any fakery
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:06.120]  with the tests about oh the asymptomatic and the thing and the PCR
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:11.640]  could be maybe a hundred new cases
[3:43:11.640 --> 3:43:14.520]  nothing like that
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:21.240]  are people actually getting sick or not when you open up Cincinnati
[3:43:21.240 --> 3:43:26.040]  and the answer would be uh-uh no not happening
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:29.800]  to any greater degree than is already happening
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:34.840]  just from the normal course of living from year to year
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:39.000]  and the whole thing would be exposed
[3:43:39.080 --> 3:43:44.600]  the war is already underway the country has been leveled
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:50.680]  and the president's duty is to counter attack
[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:54.920]  force open the economy
[3:43:54.920 --> 3:43:59.640]  override the governors
[3:43:59.640 --> 3:44:02.120]  and then
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:06.520]  if they want to go to the u.s supreme court which they can
[3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:10.360]  and yes the u.s supreme court could decide to rush a case right there and
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:13.640]  hear it a dispute between the federal
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:18.600]  government and the states let's hear it let's have that case right out in the
[3:44:18.600 --> 3:44:22.040]  open let's have all these dissident scientists
[3:44:22.040 --> 3:44:26.280]  with heavy credentials showing up to say
[3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:30.760]  Fauci essentially is a complete
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:36.360]  pleat fraud here's what distancing really does
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:40.120]  and doesn't do here's what masks really do and don't do
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:46.440]  here's the fakery of the tests and the inflated case numbers and the lying
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:50.680]  lay it out for the supreme court and the public and the whole country
[3:44:50.680 --> 3:44:55.800]  to hear and understand completely in DDGD do
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:45:00.600]  let's have that case bring it on potato heads
[3:45:00.600 --> 3:45:04.120]  bring it on you college grads who think that
[3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:08.680]  because you took four science courses you know anything about anything
[3:45:08.680 --> 3:45:11.640]  I stand by Fauci you don't even know what you're talking about
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:16.680]  you don't know who Fauci is you have no clue
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:24.680]  counter attack Trump it's never too late see you next time
