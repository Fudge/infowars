[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You've got it
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.360]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.360 --> 00:17.440]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:21.440 --> 00:23.440]  We are broadcasting worldwide
[00:23.440 --> 00:29.600]  It is the fourth day of march
[00:30.560 --> 00:35.920]  2012 we're going to be here for the next two hours and Dr. Jerome Corsi
[00:35.920 --> 00:38.240]  You can only pop in with us for about 15 minutes
[00:38.720 --> 00:39.520]  Friday
[00:39.520 --> 00:46.160]  We'll be joining us for a full hour via video skype for prismplanet.tv viewers and better audio for radio listeners
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.960]  And i'm going to cover the economy with dr. Corsi. I'm going to cover the iran situation
[00:50.960 --> 00:57.520]  Of course, he was part of sheriff arpaio's big investigation confirming that the birth certificate is a forgery
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.440]  And a fraud we're going to look at that and cover the waterfront
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.880]  With a very informed guest who has a lot of big inside connections and can tell us where the attack on iran is going
[01:09.520 --> 01:12.640]  And again, there's a lot of things iran does that i don't like
[01:13.120 --> 01:16.080]  A lot of things china does i don't like it doesn't mean we're going to have war with them
[01:16.240 --> 01:18.560]  You know china has nuclear weapons. We're going to have a war with them
[01:18.560 --> 01:21.520]  I ran as far away from getting a nuclear weapon
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.960]  I don't want this war because the globalists are going to use it to take liberties at home
[01:28.240 --> 01:30.240]  That doesn't mean that
[01:33.680 --> 01:34.800]  I
[01:34.800 --> 01:41.040]  Want to live under the mulas or something it it means that our country has been turned into an engine of empire
[01:41.440 --> 01:45.120]  And the empire sells all these invasions and wars on spreading freedom
[01:45.120 --> 01:52.720]  They're not spreading freedom. They've put actual al-qaeda in command of libya on record. That's not debated. That's NBC news la times
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.360]  They're using them to attack
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.920]  Syria to get rid of Assad but something worse in they're taking more rights
[02:00.480 --> 02:02.480]  under the western backed
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.920]  revolution in egypt and and the program is wrecked these countries
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.200]  And I want the iranians to have good lives. I want americans to have good lives
[02:11.200 --> 02:17.040]  I want the egyptians the russians the chinese mexicans resilience south africans
[02:17.680 --> 02:20.080]  I just want humanity to have a fair shake
[02:21.920 --> 02:23.920]  And
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.720]  Undoubtedly there have been corrupt evil engines before
[02:27.600 --> 02:31.600]  Communism under the soviets, but you go research you find out the big megabanks
[02:32.480 --> 02:35.200]  The people that created the fellow reserve the folks that control england
[02:35.200 --> 02:41.840]  They openly funded the communist and and and then use that threat
[02:43.600 --> 02:46.240]  That real threat to take our liberties here
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.400]  And to have giant government contracts given to their defense and intelligence complex
[02:53.280 --> 03:00.000]  And so they basically sell weapons and technology and and systems of surveillance and media control to all sides
[03:01.200 --> 03:04.000]  It's it's so elementary that a lot of people
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.600]  People just can't understand it because it's in plain view
[03:09.200 --> 03:11.200]  And it's that simple
[03:12.960 --> 03:14.720]  Now
[03:14.720 --> 03:18.480]  When I come back from break i'm just going to mention the stacks of news here. They're all very important
[03:19.520 --> 03:21.520]  And uh, it also made big news
[03:22.720 --> 03:27.680]  A month ago when davis staying out of context was uh, everybody said he endorsed santorum
[03:27.680 --> 03:29.360]  He did not endorse santorum
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.800]  It became a big national story
[03:30.800 --> 03:34.800]  And when he pointed out that he did not endorse rick santorum just that he doesn't like romney
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.520]  Um
[03:37.520 --> 03:39.520]  They didn't really cover that
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.520]  um
[03:42.400 --> 03:48.000]  Dave is here in town played in austin and he's staying with me for a few days emin is a wonderful wife pam
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.120]  And uh, it probably won't be a live interview because i want to do it really good in studio tomorrow
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  Uh after the radio show
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.320]  For the nightly news in a few days because i want to cut the music in and part of the concert
[04:00.320 --> 04:04.160]  Make it real good, but that's going to be a powerful interview. We haven't shot yet
[04:04.640 --> 04:06.880]  I want you know, we've done some in person before as well
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.320]  Uh with dav interesting story last night if i have time today, I'll tell it just because it's it's interesting
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.240]  I'm getting to where I don't even know what week it is anymore because there's so much happening
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.360]  And coast to coast i am one of me on last night
[04:20.560 --> 04:22.560]  and uh
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.440]  So the concert ends at about 10 15, but he played like five extra songs and then was saying bye because it was
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.960]  End of the tour to the rest of the man, so I'm speeding to get home to go on coast to coast to him with Dave
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.920]  Mustang and his wife and the cop pulls me over
[04:36.560 --> 04:41.920]  And and he probably it was like a 50 mile an hour because he had construction, but he let me off was a nice officer
[04:41.920 --> 04:43.600]  I could tell he was a listener
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.600]  uh, but uh
[04:47.200 --> 04:53.440]  More and more I almost missed a ron paul interview a few months ago and got here the minute the show started with ron paul
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.000]  I mean, I have just got this budget and more time. I'm doing too much big news coming up
[04:59.600 --> 05:05.040]  When you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road

[06:39.440 --> 06:41.760]  That's why i'm the hardest working man in top radio

[06:47.920 --> 06:55.040]  Here every sunday 4 to 6 p.m. A lot of great affiliates out there picking up the sunday show xm is not yet
[06:55.040 --> 07:02.480]  Picked up the sunday show they pick up the weekday show live working on that and i have got a lot to talk about
[07:03.840 --> 07:07.600]  Today we have dr. Jerome corcy joining us
[07:08.720 --> 07:10.720]  here on this
[07:11.200 --> 07:20.160]  March 4th 2012 sunday edition to talk about the economy his inside sources on the upcoming iran war can that be averted can that be stopped
[07:20.160 --> 07:25.200]  He's the main guy doing helping do research with the forensic experts worldwide with dr. Jerome
[07:25.760 --> 07:27.760]  Of course he out there working with
[07:27.920 --> 07:34.400]  Sheriff harpio out in phoenix and of course coming out last week in the press conference last thursday and saying it is a forgery
[07:34.400 --> 07:37.360]  It is a fraud that's probable cause to begin an investigation
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.320]  Because that fraud is being perpetrated against the people of arizona in that county
[07:42.320 --> 07:48.000]  You see you can have the bottom attack the top. That's why we have the states while we have the counties the real authority is in the states
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.840]  So that is coming up and we'll be able to take your calls as well for dr. Corsi
[07:52.400 --> 07:55.600]  I'm not giving the number out yet. Now. Now. Now. Here's the incredible news
[07:56.800 --> 08:02.960]  Death toll from twisters rises to 37 in four states a baby was taken two miles up
[08:03.680 --> 08:06.560]  And thrown into a field like something out of
[08:07.600 --> 08:12.400]  The wizard of Oz but the baby didn't get set softly down like uh dorthy
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.600]  Now more like the house got dropped on it, but it's in critical condition and you know, my point is I had the guys pull the numbers up from the
[08:19.840 --> 08:23.520]  No, uh and and and on average there's more than 200
[08:24.320 --> 08:26.320]  deaths from tornadoes every year
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.800]  200 this is uh
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.240]  37
[08:30.240 --> 08:32.240]  Just in one day boom
[08:33.360 --> 08:38.640]  They don't even tell you have storm shelters anymore. I mean all timers didn't need to be told to have a storm cellar
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.120]  They didn't need to be told to store food. They didn't need to be told. They need a shotgun in case a prowler comes around
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.360]  They didn't need to be told to not walk in traffic or tie their shoelaces
[08:47.920 --> 08:52.480]  I saw an article when I was out in Orlando and I'm actually I kept it, but I don't know where it is
[08:52.720 --> 08:56.080]  It's on the cover of the paper about pedestrian accidents are way up
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.600]  Well, yeah, people just walk right out in front of you people on bikes get on highways now bicycles just get in front of you
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.520]  You've seen the videos people walking in malls and they walk right into somebody's house
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.600]  You've seen the videos people walking in malls and they walk right into somebody or walk right into the
[09:10.160 --> 09:12.880]  You know the the fountain because they're on their smartphones
[09:13.200 --> 09:17.120]  I mean people are just in a trance and I was looking at the statistics in the article
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.840]  I mean it's several hundred percentage point increase that was giving nationwide statistics
[09:21.840 --> 09:26.000]  We're talking about how bad Orlando was because that's folks on vacation. They're really not paying attention
[09:26.320 --> 09:28.400]  Just walking out in front of cars just
[09:28.400 --> 09:35.040]  Again people are getting more and more unconscious the the language is becoming restricted
[09:35.920 --> 09:38.240]  And you've got two different camps. You've got those that are awake
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.760]  And that's a growing group and you've got the others that are kind of asleep who are getting into a deeper trance
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.200]  And I guess there's a third group
[09:45.200 --> 09:50.480]  There's there's globalists that are awake but decide to use the facts of the general public is sleepwalking literally
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.320]  I mean brainwaves have lowered the last 50 years since television became popularized video games lower brainwaves
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.640]  Most people are in a mere sleep-like state. They're there the and you talk to them their eyes are glazed over
[10:03.520 --> 10:09.680]  They are literally in a mesmerized state. That's what television does to you if it's not interactive
[10:10.320 --> 10:17.600]  Uh, reading is the best listening is second best computers are not very good because the flicker rate and things at least you're interactive
[10:17.600 --> 10:20.160]  That tends to keep you somewhat more conscious
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.720]  Uh, reading is the best you've got an image it
[10:22.720 --> 10:27.200]  Uh, so is radio all the studies show that because you're having the image in your mind
[10:27.920 --> 10:29.920]  When I say Andrew Breitbart
[10:30.400 --> 10:37.280]  That you the synapses of your brain of that electrochemical computer goes out and pulls up an image of Andrew Breitbart
[10:38.320 --> 10:44.320]  And the coroner is looking at murder. Uh, that's in the Los Angeles Times. Oh, I'm the evil conspiracy theorist
[10:44.640 --> 10:46.640]  You'd be a fool
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.640]  With this guy bringing down Akron upwards of eight billion dollars a year to all these big city machines
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.320]  You know these mafia types and and and and and saying i'm gonna get you
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.680]  I'm releasing footage march 1st of you at communist meetings and he dies in the early morning hours of march 1st
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.320]  While he's at a table at a bar drinking two glasses of wine with dozens of people talking to him and sitting around him
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.480]  It's been reported by witnesses
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.640]  Oh, he had a heart attack or had some heart problems. Maybe they poisoned him then he's 43
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.200]  The point is the timing of this him saying i'm gonna bring you down obama. Oh, yeah
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.200]  You know get and jumping up and down at c-pac three weeks ago and telling people in you know march 1st
[11:25.200 --> 11:29.120]  It's over for obama and he dies march 1st. Let me come on mama didn't raise a fool
[11:30.960 --> 11:32.640]  Foul play
[11:32.640 --> 11:35.120]  My gut tells me it's absolute foul play and my gut
[11:36.720 --> 11:39.520]  The more I listen to my gut the better my life gets
[11:39.520 --> 11:45.440]  I just can't believe how accurate it is. So I still just don't go off my gut, but it's it's it's got a perfect record
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  perfect unless i'm tired
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.600]  Uh, or uh, you know a too big a meal then my gut doesn't work because it's working on something else
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  But here it is andrew brightbart corner wants to cover all the bases
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.640]  And uh, we'll be looking uh at all the causes including foul play. That's los angeles times. So there you go
[12:04.640 --> 12:10.240]  You know, I told you the big telltale sign he was killed is that within less than two hours of him being killed
[12:10.320 --> 12:14.160]  I went look to the timestamps on the articles. They were announcing that it was natural causes
[12:16.320 --> 12:18.720]  Now when that starts happening you better look out
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.560]  And then I said if they don't release the footage he was going to release march 1st. Look out now. They're saying two weeks
[12:28.400 --> 12:32.320]  So out of all these things going on in the world that are are more important
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.600]  And this individually though signals if it wasn't assassination, I hope it wasn't and maybe it's not
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.240]  It's scary because you know it came out in the newspapers a few years ago that i'm on the white house enemies list
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.240]  So is uh, andrew brightbart. So is matt drudge and now it's been
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.480]  Lawsuits have been filed and they've gotten the documents that drudge is spied on
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.400]  By homeland security. I mean they track everything and of course, uh
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.440]  Liberty guard headed up by bob bar has been suing. We got to get by the way get the former congressman back on
[13:03.520 --> 13:07.360]  He said he'd come back on he's been he's now suing. I'm trying to get
[13:08.640 --> 13:16.960]  For a request for searches of alex jones info wars.com drudgereport.com and things like that because their internal whistleblower told them
[13:17.680 --> 13:20.800]  That uh people that complain and stuff they're putting on the list
[13:20.800 --> 13:27.840]  Uh and that they were basically surveilling and and telling their employees that we're basically terrorist
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.520]  And that was like six months ago eight months ago bob bar was given that by sources and he's been suing asking for it
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.440]  They they well first he the foyer and they declared national security. So now he's suing
[13:37.600 --> 13:44.800]  So all of this is going on and big sis admits she reads our articles and you know, they're on drudge on other sites and does not like them
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.520]  And yeah, i'm going up against these corrupt individuals in homeland security
[13:49.520 --> 13:52.880]  That have been caught shipping guns into mexico to blame the second amendment
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.680]  So there's the news on that front erin dyke says a big report out
[13:58.320 --> 14:05.760]  On it right now at info wars.com. He's up here working on sunday the great Stalinist purge of media critics
[14:06.640 --> 14:08.640]  On obama's reported enemies list
[14:11.280 --> 14:17.280]  It's reported in an oh nine obama's enemies list a roadmap for a great purging of critics in the lead up to 2012 elections
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.840]  Well, if they'll ship guns into mexico that have killed 2,000 people
[14:20.880 --> 14:22.880]  In mexico hundreds here including
[14:23.920 --> 14:31.760]  What is it now three border patrol agents and three police officers 100 killed and it was 100 to blame the second amendment g
[14:33.280 --> 14:40.400]  If they'll fund al-qaeda to attack libya and take it over and purge tens of thousands of black people that's on record now
[14:40.400 --> 14:43.760]  We first told you with tarp Lee and others who went there to witness it
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.280]  And I had tarp Lee on while bombs were going off and the phone line would cut out here
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  Boom
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.120]  And then you know the phone line would cut out
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.240]  And he said yes, they're lining blacks up and shooting them and then months later
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.200]  All the news here is like yeah, there's a big purge. I mean what on earth is going on here
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.680]  And now i'm unpatriotic because i don't support al-qaeda. Well, look if that's unpatriotic, then i'm sorry i'm not patriotic
[15:08.640 --> 15:11.200]  And then if it's patriotic have the tsa federal eyes
[15:11.200 --> 15:17.280]  And then if it's patriotic have the tsa federalizing everything if it's patriotic they have wide open borders while you say give up our rights
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.960]  You know my point about these horrible twisters is they don't tell people have storm sellers here in austin where i live and we're in tornado alley
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.720]  I was looking it up in central texas
[15:29.680 --> 15:33.760]  In just the last 20 years there's been over 300 deaths from tornadoes
[15:34.960 --> 15:36.960]  I mean how many they're killing jerry
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.400]  There's a whole bunch just in one one wheel in just a few minutes
[15:41.040 --> 15:47.200]  But but but again. Oh be scared of terrorism. You got a better chance of dying from honeybeesting or champagne cork or slipping in the shower
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.400]  Or tornadoes, but oh my gosh. Let's not get prepared for any of that or spiders biting you
[15:53.200 --> 15:59.200]  Or deer jumping out in front of you. Let's freak out about the scary man. It's all about the system power grabbing your tax money

[16:48.000 --> 16:59.360]  A little over a year ago
[16:59.360 --> 17:05.360]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving
[17:05.360 --> 17:13.360]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[17:13.360 --> 17:21.360]  Are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[17:21.360 --> 17:23.360]  Fight off cancer and be healthy
[17:23.360 --> 17:29.360]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young jevity

[18:59.360 --> 19:03.360]  This is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[19:03.360 --> 19:07.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[19:07.360 --> 19:13.360]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[19:13.360 --> 19:19.360]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[19:19.360 --> 19:23.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[19:23.360 --> 19:27.360]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[19:27.360 --> 19:31.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.360]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[19:43.360 --> 19:45.360]  One of my oldest sponsors
[19:45.360 --> 19:49.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[19:49.360 --> 19:51.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com

[19:55.360 --> 20:09.360]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[20:25.360 --> 20:31.360]  All right, let me tell you some of the other big news that's obviously coming up today
[20:31.360 --> 20:33.360]  ahead of Dr. Corsi joining us
[20:33.360 --> 20:39.360]  Russian election, cheerful Vladimir Putin wins presidency
[20:39.360 --> 20:42.360]  And there's clear evidence of election fraud over there
[20:42.360 --> 20:46.360]  You can go over it if you want, but it's there
[20:46.360 --> 20:48.360]  But there's also media critics being silenced and things
[20:48.360 --> 20:52.360]  And there's election fraud in this nation, you better believe it
[20:52.360 --> 20:56.360]  When Ron Paul was winning early states, they just stole him in Iowa and Maine
[20:56.360 --> 21:00.360]  And it came out weeks and months later that they were stolen
[21:00.360 --> 21:03.360]  And they just say, we're not going to discuss it, move along
[21:03.360 --> 21:08.360]  And then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that Romney is the man
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.360]  And between all of them, it doesn't matter
[21:13.360 --> 21:18.360]  I mean, Newt Gennrich is so bad that I guess Santorum or Mitt Romney are better
[21:18.360 --> 21:21.360]  I can't believe I just said that, but with somebody as bad as Gennrich
[21:21.360 --> 21:22.360]  I mean, that's just the way it is
[21:22.360 --> 21:25.360]  But it doesn't matter because they're just puppets
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.360]  Ron Paul's a real candidate, so he was shut out
[21:28.360 --> 21:32.360]  Oh, but Ahmed Denizad is in trouble
[21:32.360 --> 21:36.360]  He's coming very close to losing their seats in parliament
[21:36.360 --> 21:41.360]  And then of course, then that'll force him out and there'll be a new president
[21:41.360 --> 21:45.360]  But it doesn't matter because they're the moulas choose who can get on the ballot
[21:45.360 --> 21:49.360]  So it's kind of like here, the elites decide, okay, you can vote for Obama or Romney
[21:49.360 --> 21:52.360]  They both are paid for by Goldman Sachs on record
[21:52.360 --> 21:56.360]  And the former head of Bain Capital is going to be the head economic guy for Obama
[21:56.360 --> 21:59.360]  I mean, the guy that Mitt Romney hired and trained and works for him
[21:59.360 --> 22:02.360]  And Romney still owns a big part of Bain Capital
[22:02.360 --> 22:03.360]  It's in a blind trust
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.360]  Now works for Obama
[22:05.360 --> 22:08.360]  I mean, there is no difference, zero
[22:08.360 --> 22:15.360]  With those two guys, it is literally like WWF, Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant
[22:15.360 --> 22:19.360]  It isn't real, and I still run into adults that tell me wrestling's real
[22:19.360 --> 22:23.360]  You're the same folks that believe in Santa Claus, okay?
[22:23.360 --> 22:29.360]  And Ron Paul comes along and says, I'm not going to play along with the Santa Claus game
[22:29.360 --> 22:33.360]  And everybody freaks out
[22:33.360 --> 22:36.360]  And that's all that's happening, that's all that's going on here
[22:36.360 --> 22:41.360]  Okay, that said
[22:41.360 --> 22:44.360]  We're going to be getting into that
[22:44.360 --> 22:48.360]  Continuing here
[22:48.360 --> 22:54.360]  I want to get into a news piece that we're going to air at the end of this hour
[22:54.360 --> 22:57.360]  That isn't even really about the particular story I'm going to be covering
[22:57.360 --> 23:11.360]  But it's about how the police and other government systems are so used to dealing with media that just regurgitates whatever they say
[23:11.360 --> 23:16.360]  That they were completely blown away when we went out a few months ago
[23:16.360 --> 23:24.360]  And pointed out that they're buying millions and millions of dollars worth of armored gunboats with giant machine guns mounted on them
[23:24.360 --> 23:29.360]  And then it's a dangerous precedent, and now the media is using the term gunboat
[23:29.360 --> 23:36.360]  KVUE here in Austin and a bunch of other TV stations and publications
[23:36.360 --> 23:42.360]  So when my reporter showed up to film new boats with machine guns, giant machine guns mounted on them
[23:42.360 --> 23:44.360]  They just flipped out on them
[23:44.360 --> 23:49.360]  And then started calling our local affiliate 590 that we're on right now
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.360]  Trying to engage in a PSYOP
[23:51.360 --> 23:57.360]  So this is going to be a great teaching moment for the public but also for the Texas State Police
[23:57.360 --> 24:03.360]  Who are famous for files on people and illegal spy rings and things in the 70s and 80s that got shut down
[24:03.360 --> 24:08.360]  DPS intelligence, they're all back at their old tricks, it's subsidiary of Homeland Security
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.360]  The last DPS director was not going along with this so he's out
[24:11.360 --> 24:14.360]  And I've seen a lot of changes now that they got rid of the last director
[24:14.360 --> 24:17.360]  And I don't like it, and it's dangerous
[24:17.360 --> 24:20.360]  And what I saw out of them is creepy
[24:20.360 --> 24:23.360]  And that's why we're going to have to now examine the state police very closely
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.360]  And you are not on our radar screen, you are on it now
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.360]  Big time
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.360]  And obviously you're running scared, the wicked flea when none pursue
[24:32.360 --> 24:37.360]  So I don't know why you flipped out like this
[24:37.360 --> 24:44.360]  But wait till you hear the story, I mean it is bizarre, bizarre what happened
[24:44.360 --> 24:50.360]  So that is coming up with that report, with the video report of us trying to get to interview with their spokesman
[24:50.360 --> 24:59.360]  Okay, this next piece of news before I get into the big news I ran was so crazy
[24:59.360 --> 25:03.360]  And I called Paul Watson about this this morning and he said, you don't know, it's been out since Friday
[25:03.360 --> 25:07.360]  We posted it Friday, Georgia Port had it Friday, you don't know about this
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.360]  And I said no, and I read three different mainstream articles and I cannot believe this
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.360]  I cannot get my mind around it because it's so crazy
[25:18.360 --> 25:21.360]  It's so crazy
[25:21.360 --> 25:30.360]  You've heard of the TSA, making women drink their own breast milk to make sure it's not a bomb
[25:30.360 --> 25:36.360]  It's all about arbitrary, everybody's a terrorist, take your shoes off, take your belt off, go in a scanner
[25:36.360 --> 25:39.360]  We're going to touch your genitals, it's all slave training, prisoner training
[25:39.360 --> 25:42.360]  They admit that's what it is, and it's training everybody for federalization
[25:42.360 --> 25:49.360]  An unbonded, unsworn, non-police kind of brown shirt, brigade, every third world country does this
[25:49.360 --> 25:55.360]  They set up like an auxiliary oppression force
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.360]  Because the police are trained at least to know something in the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.360]  You know, the cops don't pull you over and go, just randomly, okay, everybody, I pull over, I grab your genitals
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.360]  Everybody knows that's illegal violation of the Fourth Amendment, it's a violation of the Tenth Amendment
[26:08.360 --> 26:18.360]  And I've seen cases, literally hundreds of cases where they now make women go behind closed doors and take their bras off
[26:18.360 --> 26:20.360]  So that women can fondle them
[26:20.360 --> 26:24.360]  Look, why is it okay for same sex to fondle you?
[26:24.360 --> 26:30.360]  I mean, in a way, I'd kind of like the opposite sex to fondle me, not that I like it, but it might be a little better
[26:30.360 --> 26:34.360]  It's kind of like a couple times a year, I go get a massage and I request a woman
[26:34.360 --> 26:38.360]  It's not because I'm going to be doing anything with them in there, or a happy ending as they call it
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.360]  I don't like guys touching me, I don't like how guys smell, I don't like how they look
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.360]  Guys look like kind of dirty looking monkeys or something to me
[26:48.360 --> 26:56.360]  You know what I mean, women look beautiful, magical, juicy, you know, I mean, it's like a plate of enchiladas or something
[26:56.360 --> 27:04.360]  Men look like a bucket of dog crap, I'm sorry to use that, but you know, the point is, it's just like, well, don't worry
[27:04.360 --> 27:10.360]  We have women searching you, or we have women sticking their hands down your two-year-old daughter's pants
[27:10.360 --> 27:17.360]  How is that okay? I mean, guys rape guys, I mean, is it like okay if guys go out in the park and rape another guy?
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.360]  Well, it's a guy, I mean, it's like worse
[27:22.360 --> 27:30.360]  Okay, you're saying what is the craziest thing that I've ever seen and I'm about to talk about here
[27:30.360 --> 27:37.360]  She's got a breast pump, and they scan it, and it's the name of the company, it's a breast pump, and they say, well, the bottles are empty
[27:37.360 --> 27:42.360]  And the lady says, yeah, it's my breast pump, you know, I'm going out to tell my babies with me, I've got to work some
[27:42.360 --> 27:50.360]  There's a babysitter, I'm going to have to pump milk, you know, my wife did it three times when we were going to go out to dinner
[27:50.360 --> 27:59.360]  Or go out to dinner in a movie, we've gone three, four hours, my wife would have to sit there and pump the milk and give it to the babysitter or family that came over to keep one of our children
[27:59.360 --> 28:09.360]  I mean, I know it's evil, I know there's a war against breastfeeding, a war against organic, a war against anything reality based by this plastic culture of death
[28:09.360 --> 28:18.360]  But the TSA did apologize for this, but then they never stopped, and he said, you're going to pump that right now, you're going to come back and show me that you've got milk in your breast
[28:18.360 --> 28:21.360]  And if you don't want to hear this on the radio, I know this is what's happening to our women
[28:21.360 --> 28:27.360]  So she had to go in a, she says, are there a private place? He said no, even though they had the little private rope room where they liked to molest people
[28:27.360 --> 28:36.360]  He said no, you'll go in the bathroom, so she had to stand in front of everyone at the metal mirrors and do it and then come out and then he inspected it and basically yelled at her
[28:36.360 --> 28:42.360]  It's land of the humiliated cowards and slaves, land of the people that will take anything
[28:42.360 --> 28:51.360]  I'm going to tell you more about this when we come back, then I ran, and what's happening with the electric cars that no one wants to buy, that you pay for with your taxpayer money to build the assembly lines on
[28:51.360 --> 28:57.360]  But now they're shutting those down, it's all coming up, I'm Alex Jones and FullWars.com

[33:01.360 --> 33:04.360]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[33:04.360 --> 33:19.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network Network
[33:34.360 --> 33:50.360]  It's always about more power, more arbitrary power, 10 years after 9-11, the TSA as Forbes reported last week
[33:50.360 --> 33:55.360]  TSA coming to a highway near you, in fact put that up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers
[33:55.360 --> 33:59.360]  A congresswoman who I want to get on did a story about, yeah, they're all over the country now
[33:59.360 --> 34:02.360]  You pull up the checkpoints and they're now groping you on highways
[34:02.360 --> 34:04.360]  They're not sworn officers
[34:04.360 --> 34:06.360]  I've checked, it's illegal
[34:06.360 --> 34:10.360]  Police aren't allowed to start groping you or stop you without a warrant
[34:10.360 --> 34:12.360]  Or without probable cause
[34:12.360 --> 34:14.360]  What is this? And she's like, we've got to pass a law
[34:14.360 --> 34:18.360]  Lady, congresswoman, there are laws
[34:18.360 --> 34:20.360]  They're not following them
[34:20.360 --> 34:23.360]  The feds are power grabbing
[34:23.360 --> 34:26.360]  And it has nothing to do with Al Qaeda
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.360]  The globalists are putting in charge everywhere
[34:31.360 --> 34:35.360]  We do have in the next segment that Darren McBrain report on the DPS gunboats
[34:35.360 --> 34:38.360]  And they're flipping out on us for trying to cover them
[34:38.360 --> 34:39.360]  That's coming up
[34:39.360 --> 34:42.360]  But continuing here, here it is, TSA
[34:42.360 --> 34:49.360]  Ask woman to prove her breast pump is real at airport
[34:49.360 --> 34:51.360]  And do me a favor, since you're showing that on screen
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.360]  Scroll down to the actual newscast
[34:53.360 --> 34:55.360]  That's Mike Adams, great report at infoawards.com
[34:55.360 --> 34:57.360]  I want to show people cause they won't believe it
[34:57.360 --> 35:01.360]  The KSDK link right there
[35:01.360 --> 35:03.360]  I want to show folks that if they're watching
[35:03.360 --> 35:05.360]  There it is, news five
[35:05.360 --> 35:07.360]  Where the news comes first, TSA
[35:07.360 --> 35:11.360]  Ask woman to prove her breast pump is real at airport
[35:11.360 --> 35:14.360]  And it's in Hawaii
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.360]  And she's, I mean, again
[35:18.360 --> 35:20.360]  I have been in airports
[35:20.360 --> 35:22.360]  I was in Billings, Montana
[35:22.360 --> 35:25.360]  And the woman had her hotel
[35:25.360 --> 35:27.360]  She had her shampoo
[35:27.360 --> 35:29.360]  And look, I'm not a pack rat
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.360]  But when I go to a hotel and they got lotion
[35:31.360 --> 35:34.360]  And they got a sewing kit they're giving you
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.360]  Or they've got, I even get the shower cap as a joke
[35:37.360 --> 35:39.360]  And then pull out of my bag when I get home
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.360]  And put it on my head and let my kids laugh at me
[35:41.360 --> 35:43.360]  But you know, I'll take the lotion, I'll take the shampoo
[35:43.360 --> 35:46.360]  I have seen them repeatedly, but one time in Billings
[35:46.360 --> 35:48.360]  It was a woman and her husband and her kids
[35:48.360 --> 35:51.360]  And this jackboot started screaming at her
[35:51.360 --> 35:53.360]  Why do you have this, you know?
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.360]  It says over there ounces
[35:55.360 --> 35:57.360]  And then it was sure enough
[35:57.360 --> 36:00.360]  Below the ounce amount, she was just flipping out on someone
[36:00.360 --> 36:03.360]  I mean, who else wants a job
[36:03.360 --> 36:06.360]  Hin pecking and messing with law abiding citizens
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.360]  It sounds like the most horrible thing in the world
[36:09.360 --> 36:11.360]  I mean, even when somebody's done something wrong to me
[36:11.360 --> 36:14.360]  I don't like having to get in their face
[36:14.360 --> 36:16.360]  Because then if they bow up, well, you know, things escalate
[36:16.360 --> 36:20.360]  But just this hin pecking normal people
[36:20.360 --> 36:22.360]  And treating us like we're criminals
[36:22.360 --> 36:24.360]  Like, I got pulled over last night
[36:24.360 --> 36:27.360]  I was speeding, and I said, okay, I agree
[36:27.360 --> 36:29.360]  I was probably speeding, just give him a ticket, please
[36:29.360 --> 36:32.360]  And the guy came back and said, no, Alex, I'm just going to give you a warning
[36:32.360 --> 36:34.360]  But the point is, he didn't look all crazed-eyed
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.360]  And wasn't all, like, in my face
[36:37.360 --> 36:39.360]  Like, I was, like, you know, trying to freak me out
[36:39.360 --> 36:41.360]  And escalate things, he was just a nice guy
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.360]  Like cops used to be
[36:43.360 --> 36:45.360]  And I go, okay, fine
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.360]  But when they bow up and want to search your car
[36:47.360 --> 36:49.360]  And ask, what are you hiding? I'm like, look
[36:49.360 --> 36:51.360]  You want to have militarized gun boats
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.360]  Running around all over the place, they have a fighting drug traffic
[36:54.360 --> 36:57.360]  Make the drugs decriminalized
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.360]  I mean, I read all these federal filings
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.360]  Where the US government constantly gets caught shipping drugs in
[37:02.360 --> 37:04.360]  They have the Marines growing the opium
[37:04.360 --> 37:07.360]  Don't ask to search my car for drugs
[37:07.360 --> 37:10.360]  When the stinking things are shipped in
[37:10.360 --> 37:12.360]  And the cops are like, well, then why are we busting you
[37:12.360 --> 37:14.360]  To keep the price up, to keep it illegal
[37:14.360 --> 37:16.360]  To pack to private prisons owned by banks
[37:16.360 --> 37:18.360]  That launder the drug money
[37:18.360 --> 37:20.360]  You haven't figured this out yet?
[37:20.360 --> 37:22.360]  You need to have them illegal so they can shut down drug dealers
[37:22.360 --> 37:24.360]  That aren't sanctioned
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.360]  Mexico is collapsing because of the drug war
[37:28.360 --> 37:31.360]  Completely, every analyst out there
[37:31.360 --> 37:35.360]  Does not debate that the drug war did this to Mexico
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.360]  You made it illegal, you made it, you have a thousand times
[37:38.360 --> 37:40.360]  The profit it would have
[37:40.360 --> 37:42.360]  You regulate it like cigarettes, like beer
[37:42.360 --> 37:44.360]  You turn the bureaucrats loose on it
[37:44.360 --> 37:47.360]  Getting their piece of it, it'll be
[37:47.360 --> 37:49.360]  Well, Europe's done it many areas
[37:49.360 --> 37:52.360]  Portugal saw 70 plus percent
[37:52.360 --> 37:54.360]  Or it was like 69 percent to be technical
[37:54.360 --> 37:59.360]  Pull that up, Portugal drug decriminalization
[37:59.360 --> 38:01.360]  Big success, you'll see all the numbers
[38:01.360 --> 38:03.360]  It's like Forbes, AP Reuters
[38:03.360 --> 38:05.360]  We can do that here
[38:05.360 --> 38:07.360]  Now, does it mean the cops won't get to have black uniforms
[38:07.360 --> 38:09.360]  That kick down doors and have excuses
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.360]  To have giant paramilitary systems
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.360]  I mean, they get to be warriors
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.360]  Not actually in the foreign country fighting
[38:15.360 --> 38:17.360]  But they get to be here in a war
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.360]  And then raid the wrong house
[38:19.360 --> 38:22.360]  Every two days I see police raiding the wrong house
[38:22.360 --> 38:24.360]  Every few days I see in the news
[38:24.360 --> 38:26.360]  Where they raid some insurance salesman
[38:26.360 --> 38:28.360]  Or some old lady, or some Marine Corvette
[38:28.360 --> 38:30.360]  And the cops don't even yell police sometimes
[38:30.360 --> 38:32.360]  The person's asleep and they get up
[38:32.360 --> 38:34.360]  Don't have a gun, have a remote in their hand, get killed
[38:34.360 --> 38:36.360]  And then it corrupts the police
[38:36.360 --> 38:38.360]  I had Serpico, the famous New York detective on
[38:38.360 --> 38:41.360]  I said how many of the other narcotics detectives
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.360]  Were on the take and dealing drugs
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.360]  You said all of them but me
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.360]  All of them, all of them
[38:48.360 --> 38:51.360]  Folks, I grew up in Dallas where the police
[38:51.360 --> 38:54.360]  All of them because I wasn't into drugs
[38:54.360 --> 38:57.360]  But drugs were rampant in the 80s
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.360]  And I'd be at parties and sometimes the cop
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.360]  Would be off duty in his pickup truck
[39:02.360 --> 39:05.360]  With drugs delivering them to the party
[39:05.360 --> 39:07.360]  Whatever they people wanted
[39:07.360 --> 39:10.360]  And I'm talking about the 16-year-old kids
[39:10.360 --> 39:12.360]  And then I'm at school a month later
[39:12.360 --> 39:14.360]  And they got drug dogs wanting to search people
[39:14.360 --> 39:16.360]  Hey, I've seen you with the other cop
[39:16.360 --> 39:18.360]  You guys are drug dealers
[39:18.360 --> 39:19.360]  Oh, you're going to the office
[39:19.360 --> 39:20.360]  We're gonna slam your head in the wall
[39:20.360 --> 39:22.360]  Ask how you know this
[39:22.360 --> 39:24.360]  Threaten to plant stuff on you
[39:24.360 --> 39:27.360]  I'm just like, look, I don't use that stuff, buddy
[39:29.360 --> 39:31.360]  I don't know how people do hard drugs
[39:31.360 --> 39:33.360]  I've tried a few hard drugs once or twice
[39:33.360 --> 39:35.360]  And it literally felt like I'd been stomped in the head
[39:35.360 --> 39:36.360]  By a mule the next day
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.360]  Why would anyone use cocaine?
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.360]  Why would anyone use methamphetamine?
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.360]  If being up for two days and then throwing up
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  The third day with dry heaves
[39:45.360 --> 39:47.360]  Is your idea fun?
[39:47.360 --> 39:49.360]  They're like, oh, you just had some bad stuff
[39:49.360 --> 39:51.360]  Try it again when I was like 15
[39:51.360 --> 39:54.360]  Did the same thing, thank God
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.360]  When I've had a broken leg and they gave me opiates
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.360]  I threw up and I'm allergic to them
[40:00.360 --> 40:02.360]  I feel so sorry for everybody in bondage
[40:02.360 --> 40:04.360]  And it's big pharma
[40:04.360 --> 40:08.360]  Shelling the exact same garbage
[40:08.360 --> 40:10.360]  That's on the street, it's just synthetic
[40:10.360 --> 40:12.360]  And that's okay, though
[40:12.360 --> 40:13.360]  That's okay, though
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.360]  Even though it kills hundreds of thousands of people a year
[40:15.360 --> 40:16.360]  Go look it up
[40:16.360 --> 40:18.360]  But never mind, that's not the threat
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.360]  Tornados aren't the threat
[40:19.360 --> 40:21.360]  Cancer exploding is not the threat
[40:21.360 --> 40:22.360]  All these real threats aren't the threat
[40:22.360 --> 40:25.360]  No, TSA asked women to prove her breast pump
[40:25.360 --> 40:28.360]  Is real at airport
[40:28.360 --> 40:30.360]  KITV
[40:30.360 --> 40:33.360]  A Hawaiian mom says she was humiliated
[40:33.360 --> 40:35.360]  When asked to prove her breast pump
[40:35.360 --> 40:37.360]  Was real at an airport
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.360]  I've had them pull out a Canon
[40:40.360 --> 40:42.360]  3,000 dollar 35mm cameras
[40:42.360 --> 40:44.360]  We shoot video, they shoot the best video
[40:44.360 --> 40:46.360]  I was flying, they're like, what's this
[40:46.360 --> 40:48.360]  And I walked over because they were searching dude
[40:48.360 --> 40:49.360]  Last time I flew with him
[40:49.360 --> 40:51.360]  And I walked over the TSA person
[40:51.360 --> 40:53.360]  And I'm like, is everybody so scared of him
[40:53.360 --> 40:56.360]  You gotta talk to him, I go, it's a Canon camera
[40:56.360 --> 40:59.360]  Man, look at it, you've seen, you know that's a camera
[40:59.360 --> 41:00.360]  And the person's like, get back in line
[41:00.360 --> 41:03.360]  I'm like, no, no, he works for me
[41:03.360 --> 41:04.360]  Get your supervisor if you want
[41:04.360 --> 41:06.360]  That's a Canon camera
[41:06.360 --> 41:08.360]  And you know what a black Canon camera is
[41:08.360 --> 41:11.360]  With a Canon lens on it, don't you
[41:11.360 --> 41:13.360]  And then they call some supervisor
[41:13.360 --> 41:14.360]  Trying to intimidate me
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.360]  And that's when the loud preaching starts
[41:17.360 --> 41:19.360]  I don't care what you eat
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.360]  I'm not gonna play your mentally ill game anymore
[41:22.360 --> 41:24.360]  What's a breast pump, what's a Canon camera
[41:24.360 --> 41:26.360]  It's all about how I'm bad
[41:26.360 --> 41:29.360]  How I've done something wrong, no
[41:29.360 --> 41:33.360]  The whole TSA insanity blew up two years ago
[41:33.360 --> 41:35.360]  When I found out that my employee Michelle
[41:35.360 --> 41:37.360]  Had taken her two daughters who I've known for years
[41:37.360 --> 41:38.360]  Well, I've known one of them
[41:38.360 --> 41:39.360]  She's like eight or nine now
[41:39.360 --> 41:40.360]  But the other one was like a year old
[41:40.360 --> 41:42.360]  And they were gonna have a man
[41:42.360 --> 41:44.360]  Go in her pants at Denver Airport
[41:44.360 --> 41:46.360]  And I heard this, she came and gave the testimony
[41:46.360 --> 41:48.360]  TSA said we were liars
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.360]  Then all the videos came out of it
[41:49.360 --> 41:51.360]  Happening nationwide, Drudge Report picked it up
[41:51.360 --> 41:53.360]  Number one story for two months
[41:53.360 --> 41:56.360]  According to Alexa and all the tracker systems
[41:56.360 --> 41:58.360]  Because all that anger was already there
[41:58.360 --> 42:00.360]  People were already awake
[42:00.360 --> 42:04.360]  But boom, boom, that's why they don't like this show
[42:04.360 --> 42:07.360]  It can trigger a domino effect of people
[42:07.360 --> 42:08.360]  That are already up there and awake
[42:08.360 --> 42:10.360]  And my goal is to get other talk show hosts
[42:10.360 --> 42:12.360]  Other people informed, which I'm now seeing happening
[42:12.360 --> 42:14.360]  So they kill me or arrest me, it won't work
[42:14.360 --> 42:18.360]  And finally, after 17 years on air
[42:18.360 --> 42:20.360]  It's now 17 years next month
[42:20.360 --> 42:22.360]  Finally, I see everything I talk about
[42:22.360 --> 42:23.360]  Being a talking point now
[42:23.360 --> 42:25.360]  And being picked up by everybody
[42:25.360 --> 42:28.360]  Michael Savage reads my articles in entirety on the air
[42:28.360 --> 42:30.360]  Of course it doesn't mention it, but I don't care
[42:30.360 --> 42:33.360]  See, I don't care if he doesn't say infowars.com
[42:33.360 --> 42:34.360]  I don't care if Limbaugh
[42:34.360 --> 42:36.360]  Who has actually sourced my articles on there
[42:36.360 --> 42:37.360]  Doesn't give me credit
[42:37.360 --> 42:38.360]  All I want is the info to get out
[42:38.360 --> 42:41.360]  You see, it's not about Alex Jones
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.360]  I know the effect we're having
[42:43.360 --> 42:44.360]  But I'm going to tell you the rest of this
[42:44.360 --> 42:45.360]  Briefly when we get back
[42:45.360 --> 42:47.360]  And then we'll get into the Iran situation
[42:47.360 --> 42:50.360]  What's happening with the electric cars
[42:50.360 --> 42:53.360]  I was attacked by WikiLeaks reports by Stratford
[42:53.360 --> 42:57.360]  In a little local group here in Austin
[42:57.360 --> 43:00.360]  As a kook, which is a badge of honor
[43:00.360 --> 43:02.360]  When you're out on the road
[43:02.360 --> 43:07.360]  The last place you want to be is on the road
[43:07.360 --> 43:09.360]  But if the unfortunate happens
[43:09.360 --> 43:12.360]  You'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[43:12.360 --> 43:16.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.360]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[43:21.360 --> 43:25.360]  They so pride in every stitch
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.360]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[43:29.360 --> 43:32.360]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[43:32.360 --> 43:34.360]  Where you need it most
[43:34.360 --> 43:37.360]  Blue diamond gussets got it
[43:37.360 --> 43:39.360]  Others don't
[43:39.360 --> 43:41.360]  We turned jeans inside out
[43:41.360 --> 43:43.360]  Diamond gusset jeans
[43:43.360 --> 43:46.360]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality

[45:28.360 --> 45:29.360]  Number four
[45:29.360 --> 45:31.360]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[45:31.360 --> 45:34.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[45:34.360 --> 45:35.360]  From weather-related onages

[47:23.360 --> 47:26.360]  Look, this is a psychological warfare system
[47:26.360 --> 47:27.360]  That we live under
[47:27.360 --> 47:29.360]  Americans are to be broken
[47:29.360 --> 47:31.360]  The land of the free, the home of the brave
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.360]  Is to be terrorized with manufactured terror
[47:34.360 --> 47:36.360]  And then the federal government itself
[47:36.360 --> 47:39.360]  Run by foreign megabanks that have hijacked this country
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.360]  Are basically occupying our local police
[47:42.360 --> 47:44.360]  Using the military against us
[47:44.360 --> 47:46.360]  It's all out in the open now
[47:46.360 --> 47:48.360]  All to secure their ill-gotten gains
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.360]  The globalists are criminals
[47:50.360 --> 47:52.360]  They have to bring in a tyranny
[47:52.360 --> 47:54.360]  So they can engage in their crime
[47:54.360 --> 47:56.360]  Without getting in trouble
[47:56.360 --> 47:58.360]  That's the goal
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.360]  And always escalating that level of crime
[48:00.360 --> 48:02.360]  TSA asks women to prove
[48:02.360 --> 48:04.360]  Her breast pump is real at airport
[48:04.360 --> 48:06.360]  It's all about their personal power
[48:06.360 --> 48:08.360]  And I watch them getting off
[48:08.360 --> 48:10.360]  On harassing people
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.360]  I asked him if there was a private place
[48:13.360 --> 48:15.360]  I could go pump when he said
[48:15.360 --> 48:16.360]  You must prove
[48:16.360 --> 48:17.360]  And he said no
[48:17.360 --> 48:19.360]  You can go in the women's bathroom
[48:19.360 --> 48:21.360]  You're scum
[48:21.360 --> 48:23.360]  I had to stand in front of the mirrors
[48:23.360 --> 48:25.360]  And sinks and pump my breast
[48:25.360 --> 48:27.360]  In front of every tourist
[48:27.360 --> 48:29.360]  That walked into that bathroom
[48:29.360 --> 48:31.360]  I was embarrassed and humiliated
[48:31.360 --> 48:33.360]  And then angry that I was treated this way
[48:33.360 --> 48:35.360]  Yeah, because the plugs are by the sink
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.360]  So she's in there doing this
[48:37.360 --> 48:39.360]  When the bottle was full
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.360]  She was allowed back on the plane
[48:41.360 --> 48:43.360]  Oh yeah, back on the plane
[48:43.360 --> 48:44.360]  They pulled her off
[48:44.360 --> 48:46.360]  The TSA is apologizing saying
[48:46.360 --> 48:47.360]  The agent made a mistake
[48:47.360 --> 48:49.360]  This system-wide
[48:49.360 --> 48:51.360]  Remember, over and over again
[48:51.360 --> 48:53.360]  Dozens and dozens and dozens
[48:53.360 --> 48:55.360]  And dozens of times
[48:55.360 --> 48:57.360]  They said we're not groping under 12-year-olds
[48:57.360 --> 48:59.360]  Oh, because it violates state laws and pedophilia
[48:59.360 --> 49:01.360]  Oh, we're going to stop that
[49:01.360 --> 49:03.360]  Now when they get caught doing it
[49:03.360 --> 49:04.360]  And then they never stop
[49:04.360 --> 49:05.360]  It's all about stalling you
[49:05.360 --> 49:06.360]  All about mind games
[49:06.360 --> 49:08.360]  All about deception
[49:08.360 --> 49:10.360]  The agency released a statement saying
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.360]  In part, we accept responsibility
[49:12.360 --> 49:14.360]  For the apparent misunderstanding
[49:14.360 --> 49:16.360]  And any inconvenience or embarrassment
[49:16.360 --> 49:18.360]  Or no, they're going to continue it, see
[49:18.360 --> 49:19.360]  Just like they kept saying
[49:19.360 --> 49:20.360]  We don't strip old ladies
[49:20.360 --> 49:21.360]  We don't make people that can't walk
[49:21.360 --> 49:22.360]  Get out of wheelchairs
[49:22.360 --> 49:23.360]  That are going home to die
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.360]  And it turns out they are
[49:25.360 --> 49:26.360]  They take old ladies in there
[49:26.360 --> 49:28.360]  And they pull their underwear off
[49:28.360 --> 49:30.360]  And laugh at them
[49:30.360 --> 49:32.360]  And it just goes on and on
[49:32.360 --> 49:33.360]  We have a big breakdown on this
[49:33.360 --> 49:35.360]  From Mike Adams at Natural News
[49:35.360 --> 49:36.360]  At infowars.com
[49:36.360 --> 49:38.360]  If you want to read the full-spectrum
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.360]  Breakdown with links to the mainstream media
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.360]  Reports and video of it
[49:42.360 --> 49:45.360]  Okay, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this
[49:45.360 --> 49:48.360]  But it's so multifaceted and so bizarre
[49:52.360 --> 49:53.360]  About three months ago
[49:53.360 --> 49:56.360]  They went and did a report on militarization of police
[49:56.360 --> 49:58.360]  Now the state police were buying six
[49:58.360 --> 50:00.360]  $600-plus-thousand-dollar armored boats
[50:00.360 --> 50:02.360]  With big machine guns mounted all over them
[50:02.360 --> 50:03.360]  And we did a report
[50:03.360 --> 50:04.360]  They talked to us
[50:04.360 --> 50:06.360]  We did a report and I said, you know
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.360]  The drug war is a fraud
[50:07.360 --> 50:09.360]  And it's basically leading
[50:09.360 --> 50:11.360]  To so many of the problems that we have
[50:11.360 --> 50:13.360]  And it jacks up the prices of the drugs
[50:13.360 --> 50:15.360]  But police like to be able to seize it
[50:15.360 --> 50:16.360]  And grow their agencies
[50:16.360 --> 50:19.360]  And they also like to be involved
[50:19.360 --> 50:21.360]  In the illicit trade, the black market
[50:21.360 --> 50:23.360]  Because it's very lucrative
[50:23.360 --> 50:28.360]  The police got very rich all over the country
[50:28.360 --> 50:30.360]  During ten years of prohibition
[50:30.360 --> 50:32.360]  And they made drugs illegal right after that
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.360]  When they lost alcohol
[50:33.360 --> 50:34.360]  They had to have something new
[50:34.360 --> 50:36.360]  That's all on record
[50:36.360 --> 50:38.360]  And they have drugs illegal
[50:38.360 --> 50:40.360]  So they can shut down the competition
[50:40.360 --> 50:42.360]  And then there's no police officer I talked to
[50:42.360 --> 50:43.360]  That doesn't know
[50:43.360 --> 50:44.360]  The government's been caught
[50:44.360 --> 50:46.360]  In the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s
[50:46.360 --> 50:48.360]  Growing the opium, growing the cocaine
[50:48.360 --> 50:50.360]  Growing the coca, shipping it in
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.360]  And only shutting down their competition
[50:53.360 --> 50:56.360]  I mean, bottom line
[50:56.360 --> 50:58.360]  And now they have the troops growing the opium
[50:58.360 --> 51:00.360]  In Afghanistan and admitting it
[51:00.360 --> 51:02.360]  And then shipping it into America
[51:02.360 --> 51:05.360]  So Mexico's collapsing
[51:05.360 --> 51:07.360]  40,000 dead in the last three years
[51:07.360 --> 51:08.360]  Thousands dead on our side
[51:08.360 --> 51:11.360]  And they're using it to take our liberties again
[51:11.360 --> 51:13.360]  This is how the plan works
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.360]  So Darren McBreen says
[51:15.360 --> 51:16.360]  I want to go back out
[51:16.360 --> 51:18.360]  Because they didn't have the machine guns mounted
[51:18.360 --> 51:19.360]  The first time
[51:19.360 --> 51:21.360]  They're going to have these heavy machine guns mounted
[51:21.360 --> 51:22.360]  And boy, it looks like James Bond
[51:22.360 --> 51:24.360]  Real rows of machine guns
[51:24.360 --> 51:25.360]  Big armored boats
[51:25.360 --> 51:27.360]  They're going to be in South Texas
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.360]  But it's going to proliferate into other areas
[51:29.360 --> 51:30.360]  Drones are in the sky
[51:30.360 --> 51:31.360]  So Darren gets there
[51:31.360 --> 51:33.360]  And it's a press conference
[51:33.360 --> 51:34.360]  They've got three news cameras there
[51:34.360 --> 51:35.360]  They're talking to him
[51:35.360 --> 51:37.360]  And they see Darren walk up
[51:37.360 --> 51:39.360]  Got his info wars microphone
[51:39.360 --> 51:41.360]  And they say, we're not going to talk to you
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.360]  You were deceptive and said
[51:43.360 --> 51:45.360]  You worked for KLBJ
[51:45.360 --> 51:46.360]  The last report
[51:46.360 --> 51:47.360]  And Darren
[51:47.360 --> 51:48.360]  There is this microphone
[51:48.360 --> 51:50.360]  It says info wars
[51:50.360 --> 51:53.360]  And again, it's about changing the subject
[51:53.360 --> 51:55.360]  And Darren goes
[51:55.360 --> 51:57.360]  Well, no, the last time you
[51:57.360 --> 51:58.360]  Last time we talked to your other folks
[51:58.360 --> 51:59.360]  When we called
[51:59.360 --> 52:00.360]  Asked where the event was
[52:00.360 --> 52:01.360]  They said, who are you with?
[52:01.360 --> 52:02.360]  And we said info wars
[52:02.360 --> 52:03.360]  And that woman didn't know
[52:03.360 --> 52:05.360]  And she said, well, where are you broadcast?
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.360]  We said, well, channel 10 carries our stuff
[52:06.360 --> 52:09.360]  And also 590 a.m. KLBJ
[52:09.360 --> 52:12.360]  So again, we're there to ask them questions
[52:12.360 --> 52:13.360]  About all these
[52:13.360 --> 52:15.360]  Close to $700,000 boats
[52:15.360 --> 52:17.360]  Militarization of police
[52:17.360 --> 52:18.360]  And it's like, no, you're not on the air
[52:18.360 --> 52:19.360]  You're not media
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.360]  You don't exist
[52:20.360 --> 52:21.360]  And so then I learned
[52:21.360 --> 52:24.360]  Even before we went down there the other day
[52:24.360 --> 52:25.360]  They were anticipating it
[52:25.360 --> 52:27.360]  And we're calling
[52:27.360 --> 52:29.360]  Five different people
[52:29.360 --> 52:30.360]  And cold calling lines
[52:30.360 --> 52:31.360]  Saying, what do you think Alex Jones
[52:31.360 --> 52:32.360]  And his problems with the state police?
[52:32.360 --> 52:34.360]  Well, I never even hardly talk about
[52:34.360 --> 52:36.360]  Calling producers, calling hotlines
[52:36.360 --> 52:37.360]  Calling call in numbers
[52:37.360 --> 52:39.360]  So they were all ready to get the quote
[52:39.360 --> 52:40.360]  I guess they got somebody on the line
[52:40.360 --> 52:42.360]  To say, no, he doesn't work here
[52:42.360 --> 52:43.360]  I'm just on there
[52:43.360 --> 52:44.360]  I'm just on the radio there
[52:44.360 --> 52:47.360]  I have my own giant 16,000 square foot facility
[52:47.360 --> 52:48.360]  Over 100 stations
[52:48.360 --> 52:50.360]  XM channel 166
[52:50.360 --> 52:51.360]  Cover of talkers magazine
[52:51.360 --> 52:52.360]  3 million listeners a day
[52:52.360 --> 52:53.360]  15 million a week
[52:53.360 --> 52:54.360]  Fastest growing phenomenon
[52:54.360 --> 52:55.360]  Media worldwide
[52:55.360 --> 52:57.360]  Just number one alternative media
[52:57.360 --> 52:58.360]  So they finally got
[52:58.360 --> 52:59.360]  I learned who it was
[52:59.360 --> 53:01.360]  One person to say, oh, no, he's not
[53:01.360 --> 53:03.360]  So then they could put in their files
[53:03.360 --> 53:04.360]  I'm a liar
[53:04.360 --> 53:05.360]  I'm delusional
[53:05.360 --> 53:06.360]  I'm not on the air
[53:06.360 --> 53:07.360]  That's like the New York Times
[53:07.360 --> 53:08.360]  That time they said
[53:08.360 --> 53:10.360]  That Bilderberg wasn't happening in Virginia
[53:10.360 --> 53:12.360]  And I was in a field just crazy
[53:12.360 --> 53:14.360]  Imagining that they were there
[53:14.360 --> 53:17.360]  Armored, you know, limousines coming in
[53:17.360 --> 53:18.360]  Secret service
[53:18.360 --> 53:20.360]  Flags on the vehicles
[53:20.360 --> 53:22.360]  Marines running around in the bushes
[53:22.360 --> 53:24.360]  Bilderberg, Obama's there
[53:24.360 --> 53:25.360]  Boom, didn't exist
[53:25.360 --> 53:26.360]  I'm crazy
[53:26.360 --> 53:27.360]  And I'm not on the air right now
[53:27.360 --> 53:28.360]  You're not listening to me
[53:28.360 --> 53:30.360]  In central Texas on the number one talkstation
[53:30.360 --> 53:31.360]  590
[53:31.360 --> 53:34.360]  By the way, we're number one in the key demographics
[53:34.360 --> 53:36.360]  In places like Orlando
[53:36.360 --> 53:38.360]  And many other areas around the country
[53:38.360 --> 53:40.360]  And we're number one in some demographics
[53:40.360 --> 53:42.360]  Number two on 590
[53:42.360 --> 53:44.360]  Against all radio period
[53:44.360 --> 53:46.360]  Music, everything, dwarfing
[53:46.360 --> 53:48.360]  That's some of the highest ratings for that station
[53:48.360 --> 53:50.360]  But I'm not on it, though
[53:50.360 --> 53:51.360]  You have to understand
[53:51.360 --> 53:52.360]  I'm not on it, though
[53:52.360 --> 53:53.360]  I'm a liar
[53:53.360 --> 53:54.360]  I'm discredited
[53:54.360 --> 53:55.360]  I don't have moral authority
[53:55.360 --> 53:57.360]  See how they change the subject
[53:57.360 --> 53:59.360]  It's a warfare tactic
[53:59.360 --> 54:01.360]  In Waco, when the tanks were ramming it
[54:01.360 --> 54:02.360]  Machine gunning the people
[54:02.360 --> 54:03.360]  They were saying, this is not an assault
[54:03.360 --> 54:04.360]  Come out with your hands up
[54:04.360 --> 54:05.360]  And it's on the floor foods
[54:05.360 --> 54:06.360]  They'd come out
[54:06.360 --> 54:07.360]  They'd shoot them
[54:07.360 --> 54:08.360]  People say, oh, I'm not being attacked
[54:08.360 --> 54:09.360]  Okay, I'll come out
[54:09.360 --> 54:11.360]  And so it's a psychological warfare tactic
[54:11.360 --> 54:12.360]  They sit there with little tactics
[54:12.360 --> 54:14.360]  They learn Delphi technique
[54:14.360 --> 54:15.360]  They go to seminars
[54:15.360 --> 54:16.360]  To change it
[54:16.360 --> 54:17.360]  To change the room
[54:17.360 --> 54:18.360]  Hey, we want to talk about the machine guns
[54:18.360 --> 54:19.360]  And all this
[54:19.360 --> 54:20.360]  And the militarization
[54:20.360 --> 54:21.360]  And what's happening
[54:21.360 --> 54:23.360]  Oh, well, you're bad
[54:23.360 --> 54:26.360]  You're not on the radio
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.360]  You see how that works
[54:28.360 --> 54:29.360]  Instead of discussing the boats
[54:29.360 --> 54:30.360]  They throw it back
[54:30.360 --> 54:31.360]  You're bad
[54:31.360 --> 54:32.360]  And then start calling up
[54:32.360 --> 54:33.360]  Calling up the program directors
[54:33.360 --> 54:34.360]  Calling up the general managers
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.360]  Alex Jones is misrepresenting himself
[54:36.360 --> 54:38.360]  He wanted to do something about this
[54:38.360 --> 54:40.360]  Again, like it's Russia
[54:40.360 --> 54:41.360]  And they're trying to
[54:41.360 --> 54:42.360]  It's crazy
[54:42.360 --> 54:44.360]  So now you're on my radar screen
[54:44.360 --> 54:45.360]  Let's go to the report
[54:45.360 --> 54:46.360]  We may not have time to play at all
[54:46.360 --> 54:47.360]  It's on infowars.com
[54:47.360 --> 54:48.360]  But here's Darren McBreen
[54:48.360 --> 54:50.360]  Our reporter here at us
[54:50.360 --> 54:52.360]  Now we are here for the unveiling
[54:52.360 --> 54:54.360]  Of yet another DPS patrol vessel
[54:54.360 --> 54:56.360]  Now this is the second boat
[54:56.360 --> 54:58.360]  Of what will eventually be
[54:58.360 --> 55:00.360]  A total of six 34-foot
[55:00.360 --> 55:02.360]  Shallow water interceptors
[55:02.360 --> 55:04.360]  To patrol the Rio Grande River
[55:04.360 --> 55:06.360]  As the Texas Highway Patrol
[55:06.360 --> 55:08.360]  Goes on a wild spinning spree
[55:08.360 --> 55:09.360]  These hot rod boats cost
[55:09.360 --> 55:12.360]  Approximately $600,000 each
[55:12.360 --> 55:14.360]  And yes, that's taxpayer money
[55:14.360 --> 55:15.360]  To fight al-Qaeda
[55:15.360 --> 55:17.360]  And the small-time drug traffickers
[55:17.360 --> 55:19.360]  On the Texas rivers
[55:19.360 --> 55:20.360]  They're buying these giant
[55:20.360 --> 55:24.360]  $690,000 speed boats
[55:24.360 --> 55:26.360]  For lakes and rivers
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.360]  That have giant machine guns
[55:28.360 --> 55:30.360]  Mounted all over them
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.360]  And they didn't have the machine guns
[55:32.360 --> 55:33.360]  Mounted three months ago
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.360]  When we first went out
[55:34.360 --> 55:35.360]  And talked to them at a lake
[55:35.360 --> 55:36.360]  They didn't know who we were
[55:36.360 --> 55:38.360]  We did a nice interview
[55:38.360 --> 55:39.360]  Put it on TV
[55:39.360 --> 55:41.360]  I made my points about how they're
[55:41.360 --> 55:42.360]  We're going bankrupt
[55:42.360 --> 55:44.360]  But they're constantly militarizing
[55:44.360 --> 55:45.360]  Our police
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.360]  Darren McBreen and John Brown
[55:47.360 --> 55:48.360]  Went out there politely
[55:48.360 --> 55:50.360]  And they were bowing up
[55:50.360 --> 55:51.360]  They were saying we're not
[55:51.360 --> 55:52.360]  Going to talk to you
[55:52.360 --> 55:53.360]  Even though it was a press event
[55:53.360 --> 55:54.360]  They called
[55:54.360 --> 55:55.360]  They had state police
[55:55.360 --> 55:57.360]  Standing right up in their space
[55:57.360 --> 55:58.360]  And when they left
[55:58.360 --> 55:59.360]  They had state police
[55:59.360 --> 56:01.360]  Follow them out of the parking lot
[56:01.360 --> 56:02.360]  Stopped right there
[56:02.360 --> 56:03.360]  You know what I'm going to do
[56:03.360 --> 56:04.360]  I'm going to cut the last segment
[56:04.360 --> 56:05.360]  With Jerome Corsi
[56:05.360 --> 56:07.360]  We'll do 45 minutes with him
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.360]  Let's go ahead and get him on the line
[56:09.360 --> 56:10.360]  For the next hour
[56:10.360 --> 56:11.360]  Because I want to play this
[56:11.360 --> 56:12.360]  Actually at the end of the show
[56:12.360 --> 56:14.360]  But imagine
[56:14.360 --> 56:16.360]  That then they start calling
[56:16.360 --> 56:18.360]  Our local affiliate
[56:18.360 --> 56:20.360]  And then I learned
[56:20.360 --> 56:21.360]  From one of the producers
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.360]  And others that they've been calling
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.360]  For days before
[56:25.360 --> 56:27.360]  Ahead of time
[56:27.360 --> 56:29.360]  Again for their intelligence file
[56:29.360 --> 56:31.360]  And I told them that's the DPS intelligence
[56:31.360 --> 56:33.360]  That's what FBI files are
[56:33.360 --> 56:34.360]  They're a bunch of lies
[56:34.360 --> 56:35.360]  They're a bunch of bull
[56:35.360 --> 56:36.360]  And they call it intelligence
[56:36.360 --> 56:38.360]  So they can put in the file
[56:38.360 --> 56:40.360]  Like you didn't just hear this report
[56:40.360 --> 56:42.360]  On 590 a.m.
[56:42.360 --> 56:43.360]  Because they said so
[56:43.360 --> 56:44.360]  In the DPS report
[56:44.360 --> 56:45.360]  You know they can say
[56:45.360 --> 56:46.360]  Kebler elves are real
[56:46.360 --> 56:48.360]  They can say flying monkeys are real
[56:48.360 --> 56:49.360]  And you know what
[56:49.360 --> 56:50.360]  I mean it's like this
[56:50.360 --> 56:52.360]  The Stratford group here in Austin
[56:52.360 --> 56:54.360]  The WikiLeaks have gotten their stuff
[56:54.360 --> 56:56.360]  And it's saying here
[56:56.360 --> 56:58.360]  That the head of that
[56:58.360 --> 56:59.360]  New York Moss things
[56:59.360 --> 57:00.360]  And FBI informant
[57:00.360 --> 57:01.360]  Of course that was all the way
[57:01.360 --> 57:02.360]  To get everybody fighting with each other
[57:02.360 --> 57:04.360]  But what else is in the Stratford stuff
[57:04.360 --> 57:06.360]  This private intelligence group
[57:06.360 --> 57:07.360]  The head of it is in here
[57:07.360 --> 57:09.360]  Attacking me
[57:09.360 --> 57:11.360]  Calling me a lunatic
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.360]  And so I'll cover this later
[57:13.360 --> 57:14.360]  What a lunatic
[57:14.360 --> 57:15.360]  Because I don't listen
[57:15.360 --> 57:16.360]  To a bunch of double talk
[57:16.360 --> 57:17.360]  A lunatic
[57:17.360 --> 57:18.360]  Because I'm right so often
[57:18.360 --> 57:20.360]  A lunatic because I'm effective
[57:20.360 --> 57:22.360]  Now all you've got is terms
[57:22.360 --> 57:24.360]  Like lunatic
[57:24.360 --> 57:26.360]  To attack people like my shell
[57:26.360 --> 57:27.360]  Because you can't counter
[57:27.360 --> 57:28.360]  What I'm saying
[57:28.360 --> 57:30.360]  Is America losing its freedom
[57:30.360 --> 57:32.360]  Is globalism destroying our country
[57:32.360 --> 57:34.360]  Is the new world order cancer
[57:34.360 --> 57:35.360]  You bet it is
[57:35.360 --> 57:37.360]  I want America and the Republic back
[57:37.360 --> 57:39.360]  I stand with George Washington
[57:39.360 --> 57:41.360]  I stand with Thomas Jefferson
[57:41.360 --> 57:43.360]  Who do you stand with
[57:43.360 --> 57:45.360]  The Royal British call them cooks too
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.360]  Yankee Doodle Dandies

[59:51.360 --> 59:54.360]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[59:54.360 --> 59:58.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[59:58.360 --> 59:59.360]  Network
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:08.360]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.360]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:18.360]  This is a short segment, but Dr. Corsi PhD from Harvard University Political Science
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.360]  Expert in Banking, Military Operations, you name it, really a great source
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.360]  This information has turned out to be accurate with stunning precision many times
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.360]  He's one of the chief advisors of Sheriff Arpaio who said there's probable cause
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.360]  It is clear that the versatility it is of forgery
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.360]  His analysis is right on with ours day one, because it's what it is
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:45.360]  They've had top forensic experts world renowned say this of course in the last six months or so
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.360]  We're going to talk about that first
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:54.360]  Then we're going to get into the Iran situation, the economy with him, and a lot more with Dr. Jerome Corsi
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.360]  Doc, just give us a prelude in this short segment because we're going to go to break here in a minute
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.360]  On the Iran situation first, then we'll get back into the other stuff when we start the main segment of the show here
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.360]  But what's going on with Iran right now?
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.360]  Well, the Iran situation is about ready to break into a shooting war
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:20.360]  I've maintained that we've had a covert war with the intelligence agencies in both Israel and probably the United States
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.360]  Well you don't maintain it, you said it a few years ago and now it's admitted
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.360]  Now it's admitted, now they're finally openly admitting it
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.360]  Because we've had facilities in Iran blown up
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.360]  We've had cyber attacks against Iran
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:38.360]  Iran has retaliated, they've tried to kill Israeli diplomats in various places around the world
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360]  So the war has started
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.360]  It's a question of when it'll break out into a full-scale shooting war, Alex
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.360]  And that could be any day, you could wake up any day and that could happen
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  I also want to go back into what do you think Obama, just give us a prelude
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.360]  What do you think Obama's going to do as he free-falls in the polls
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:03.360]  And his advisors tell him, gee, a new Oklahoma City would sure help to blame our enemies with
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.360]  I mean, they're not even veiling this stuff anymore
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.360]  Well, I think it's time for Obama to start, he'll start thinking about false flag attacks
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.360]  He'll start thinking about creating crises in order to scare everybody
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.360]  I mean, I would expect there to be another economic crash that would occur very quickly
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.360]  The war with Iran is going to be a very difficult war to contain
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.360]  And any number of bizarre things can happen
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:34.360]  I mean, we've got TSA, now talking about stopping people on the highways
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.360]  I mean, the loss of freedom is just staggering
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.360]  And I don't see Obama readily giving up power
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.360]  I've never seen Obama readily giving up power
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.360]  Even if he loses the election
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.360]  And I think they are going to do everything they can
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.360]  The New World Order folks behind Obama
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.360]  Saul Linsky style, far leftists in the United States
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.360]  Do everything they can to retain power, even if it means cheating in elections
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.360]  Well, we'll break that down after the break
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.360]  What about, give us a preview of what you're going to tell us on the economic front
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.360]  I mean, because you are an expert on that front
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.360]  Why don't you tell folks about your research in that area
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.360]  Well, we're just printing money
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.360]  Worldwide, the European Union in the United States, we're printing money
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.360]  The Federal Reserve is now, I'm estimating about a trillion and a half dollars
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.360]  In credit to the EU
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.360]  This propping up of Greece is a farce
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.360]  Greece is going to default
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.360]  It's going to further default
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.360]  I'm not even sure Greece will get all the bailout money this round
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.360]  And right after Greece is going to come Italy
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.360]  And then a whole series of other countries in the EU
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.360]  Holding together the EU is a losing proposition
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:49.360]  The United States, the housing market is headed for worse than depression levels
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.360]  Real unemployment, if you measured it accurately, would be more like 22 or 25 percent
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.360]  The number of people on dependency of the federal government, food stamps, unemployment insurance
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.360]  You name it, is growing every day
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:10.360]  We're not going to create any jobs in an economy where government regulations are so tight
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.360]  Governments on our necks and the New World Order is determined to continue sending jobs
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.360]  To the lowest possible slave level job market in the world
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.360]  If China isn't low enough, the New World Order will find somewhere else to send the jobs
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.360]  And as long as we're permitting to do that
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.360]  We're on a straight slide down into a continuing global depression
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360]  Or make the 30s look like a picnic
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360]  We'll flesh that out more straight ahead
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.360]  But first we'll get into the incredible press conference that you were involved in
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.360]  With Sheriff Arpaio, what the next step is there
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.360]  Undoubtedly, Obama is hiding his providence
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:59.360]  He's hiding where he comes from, we'll be right back
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.360]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.360]  Even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.360]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.360]  Here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:22.360]  Of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360]  Fight off cancer and be healthy
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.360]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360]  And discovered Young Jevity
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.360]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.360]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.360]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.360]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible

[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.360]  We are on the march
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.360]  The Empire is on the run
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:24.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:28.360]  Held the highest level security clearance for the State Department
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360]  And that's above the CIA
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.360]  He's got a PhD from Harvard in political science
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.360]  I'm not going to get into his whole background
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.360]  Multiple, number one New York Times bestseller
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.360]  Wrote unfit for command, swift boat, veterans speak out against John Kerry
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.360]  Also many other bestselling books, America for Sale, Fighting the New World Order, Surviving a Global Depression
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.360]  And preserving USA sovereignty
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.360]  And so much of what he talked about years ago
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.360]  Has become mainstream information
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.360]  That, oh, oil, most of it isn't fossil
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.360]  It's abiotic
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360]  The list goes on and on
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.360]  I remember him a few years ago
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.360]  We were also covering it
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.360]  Talking about the covert war that western powers have against Iran's nuclear program
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360]  People are like, oh, there's not going to be a war
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360]  It's never going to happen
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.360]  There's already a war
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.360]  But we're going to get into that with Dr. Corsi
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360]  We're going to get into the economy
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.360]  He worked at the highest levels of the financial system
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.360]  He's predicted what's going to happen on that front
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.360]  And I want to see where America's going to end
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360]  I mean, how he sees the breaks happening here
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.360]  But first, he was part of the press conference last Thursday
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.360]  With Sheriff Joe Arpaio out in the Phoenix area
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.360]  Of course, Sheriff Joe announced six months ago or so
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360]  He was investigating Obama's birth certificate
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.360]  Because, you know, it's a matter there in the state with the legislature
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.360]  Saying he's got to prove himself and all the rest of it
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.360]  And his constituents kept asking him to look into it
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.360]  And as soon as he did that, he got raided by the feds
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.360]  Haming, you know, human rights abuses and things
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.360]  Not visited, raided, basically
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360]  I mean, they act so scared
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.360]  They released the fake birth certificate a week before
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360]  Dr. Corsi's book came out
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.360]  Where's the birth certificate?
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.360]  And then they had fake stories put out by their organs
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.360]  Their minions on record
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.360]  Saying the book had been recalled when it hadn't
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.360]  Just so, so, so again
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.360]  When people flee, when people act guilty
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.360]  That's always the big sign here
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.360]  Now, Dr. Corsi, break down the investigation with Arpaio
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360]  Where it goes now for people that have heard
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  Oh, that's ridiculous, we've seen his birth certificate
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.360]  We heard that for three years before he released the fake one, as you know
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.360]  But just recap for people and tell us what happened at the press conference
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.360]  And where all this is going
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.360]  Well, it's pretty stunning, this is the first time, Alex
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.360]  A law enforcement group, duly constituted law enforcement
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.360]  Sheriff Arpaio, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.360]  Has conducted a law enforcement investigation
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  It's going to be a continuing investigation
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.360]  The press conference was held to announce that the investigation
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.360]  Is determined, there's probable cause to believe
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.360]  The Barack Obama's birth certificate
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.360]  The PDF file released April 27, 2011
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.360]  Is a forgery and the Selective Service
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:20.360]  Registration card, a file supposedly in 1980 by Barack Obama
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360]  Is also a forgery
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.360]  Now, these two conclusions should be startling
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.360]  This is a law enforcement conclusion
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.360]  That now there's guilty parties out there
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.360]  Criminals involved in forging fundamental identity papers
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360]  For the President of the United States
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.360]  And when you get to this point
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360]  All the mainstream media is doing
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.360]  All the buzz in the mainstream media has been that
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.360]  Michael Zulu and the chief investigator
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.360]  Lead investigator, Cole Cates Posse and I
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.360]  Dare to release a book
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.360]  And so now the mainstream media has taken to attack us
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.360]  Saying, oh, you're trying to benefit financially
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.360]  From, you know, a public investigation
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.360]  Well, what do they do?
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.360]  I mean, that's all the media does is report on investigations
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.360]  How do you think you keep the lights on around here?
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.360]  Yeah, Michael Zulu, who is a detective
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.360]  Has done this entirely on a volunteer basis
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.360]  He hasn't made a penny out of this
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.360]  And in fact, he owns his own work product
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.360]  Yeah, but they do that just to change the subject
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.360]  You know, that's a classic tactic
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360]  I mean, come on
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360]  This is the whole thing is
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  Rather than look at the accusations that we're making
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.360]  Which are criminal, probable cause determinations
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.360]  Which means the sheriff of Ohio is going to shift now
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.360]  Into a criminal investigation
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.360]  With additional powers from his office
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360]  To the Cole Cates Posse
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.360]  Rather than even address those
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.360]  The mainstream media searches and says
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.360]  Oh, but these two guys are going to make a dollar
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.360]  Well, you can say what you want about Sheriff Joe
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.360]  But he has got big brass, you know what
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.360]  And is a hard charger
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.360]  And the system doesn't like him
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.360]  So he's okay in my book
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.360]  Well, and also, he's got tremendous courage
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.360]  Tremendous courage fighting all this
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360]  Sheriff O'Pile said, I want you to do
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360]  We checked to make sure there's no violations
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.360]  Of any regulations or rules
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360]  I'm free to write a book
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.360]  It's what I do, it's how I make my living
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360]  Mike Zulu is ready to write a book
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360]  They're just changing the subject
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360]  Tell folks the name
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  And they can get it at Amazon right now
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.360]  But the book is called
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  A Question of Eligibility
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.360]  That's subtitled
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.360]  A Law Enforcement Investigation into
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.360]  The Burst Certificate in Eligibility of Barack Obama
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.360]  E-Book, it's $9.99
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.360]  It's available right now
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.360]  On Amazon.com for the Kindle Barnes & Noble
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.360]  For the Nook, iPad
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360]  If you don't have a Kindle or Nook
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.360]  You can buy the book through the Kindle store on Amazon
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.360]  And the Nook store on Barnes & Noble
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.360]  And download onto your PC
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.360]  Let me ask you this question
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  This is the big one
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.360]  Why did they put out such a ridiculous forgery?
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.360]  I mean, look, I was going to wait
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  It came out that day
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360]  We spent all day looking at it by nighttime
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.360]  It wasn't, I mean, I did basic stuff
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360]  But now you guys have done a lot more
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.360]  Than we've done top forensic experts
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.360]  Once you tell folks about it
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360]  Have come out, but just briefly
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.360]  We went through it
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.360]  It wasn't just in layers
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360]  We were the first to break that
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.360]  It wasn't just that
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360]  It wasn't a typewriter
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.360]  Which each splat of the thing is different
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.360]  They were using the same fake typewriter front
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.360]  From some type of WordPress system
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.360]  Please explain it to people
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.360]  I mean, the C's had the same fake splats
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360]  It's fake, it's fake, it's fake
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.360]  Exactly
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360]  And in fact, it's a bad fake
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.360]  It's an obvious fake
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.360]  So why is it so bad?
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.360]  Well, you know, it's almost like
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.360]  They were tempting us
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360]  It's been suggested
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360]  That they're going to produce the real document
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.360]  From the vault
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.360]  You know, this is ridiculous
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360]  If this is the birth certificate
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.360]  This has got to stand up to forensic analysis
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360]  And it's got to be proven not to be a fake
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360]  If it's a fake
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360]  The American people have been lied to
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.360]  And I don't think there is a pen and ink
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  Original that's going to look anything like
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.360]  What was released
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360]  We want to see the microfilm
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360]  We want to see all of the original records
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.360]  From Hawaii
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  And now the FOIA requests
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360]  The law enforcement requests are going to come out
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360]  Starting on Monday
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360]  From Sheriff R. Pyle's office
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.360]  To the Hawaii Department of Health
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.360]  To show us the original record
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.360]  And let's see if Obama tries to block it
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.360]  Let's not forget a few months before this happened
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.360]  Governor Abercrombie, friends with Obama, said
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360]  I've gone and looked
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360]  It's not there
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360]  Exactly
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360]  And the whole idea of saying it's not there
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360]  And then suddenly
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360]  Okay, the book is good
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.360]  My book, where's the birth certificate
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360]  Is going to be produced
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.360]  It's about to come out
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.360]  It's on drudges, top headlines
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.360]  It's become a Amazon number one bestseller
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.360]  Donald Trump is pumping the issue
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.360]  And suddenly the birth certificate
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.360]  That Abercrombie, the governor of Hawaii
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]  Could not find
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.360]  Is magically produced by the White House
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]  Let's talk about the stamp
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360]  Let's talk about all of it
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360]  I mean, this whole thing's a forgery
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360]  They call him African American
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360]  That term wasn't in use until a decades later
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360]  I mean, it's insane
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.360]  The stamps, the registrar stamps on the birth certificate
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360]  Are on separate layers
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360]  You can pick them up
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.360]  You can move them around the document
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.360]  They leave white halos behind
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.360]  These are supposed to be the authenticating
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.360]  Stamps that are imprinted
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.360]  Onto the original document
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.360]  Not brought in, imported from external sources
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.360]  And put onto the document as a layer
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.360]  It's totally a...
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.360]  This is like when they photoshop
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360]  When photoshop was new 15, 16 years ago
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.360]  And they'd stick your head crudely on a dinosaur head
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.360]  And it's obvious it's fake
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.360]  I mean, it's ridiculous
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.360]  It's ridiculous
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.360]  And the selective service card
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360]  Which the media have ignored
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  I think is equally an important issue
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.360]  Because the cold case posse investigators
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.360]  Went and got the original stamps
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.360]  The stamp on Barack Obama's is a 1980 postal stamp
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.360]  They got the same stamp
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  From the same postal station in Hawaii
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.360]  Where Obama filed that...
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.360]  Supposedly filed that selective service registration
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.360]  Every stamp used at that time by the post service
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.360]  Had the date on the slug on the stamp
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  With four digits, 1, 9, 8, 0
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.360]  Obama's has only 8, 0
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.360]  And just shifted to the right
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360]  What the investigators found out was
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360]  They had gotten...
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360]  There was no...
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  You know, when they forged this
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.360]  They got a 2008 plug
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360]  They cut off the 0, 8
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360]  They turned it upside down and inverted it
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  Stuck it back in the plug
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  Stamped it
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.360]  The only one with the two digits
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360]  Stay there, we gotta go to break
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.360]  Explain it on the other side
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.360]  And let's not forget
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360]  He was using a fake social security number
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.360]  Of someone else in Connecticut
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.360]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.360]  And his bar certificate was cut out
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360]  Of the Kenyan records
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360]  Showing it was there
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:18.360]  I mean, it goes on and on and on
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.360]  An endless supply of nutrient dense food

[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.560]  i came out with bright bars death and i said look they can't say within two
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.000]  hours of him being dead at the hospital
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.080]  the day he's going to release
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.080]  of video
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.280]  film footage
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.760]  of obama at communist meetings where they were talking about re-educating
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:04.000]  people and throwing up overthrowing the government that's now what's being
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.160]  reported
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.080]  and then he dies
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:11.920]  and then they say oh it's natural causes go to sleep now the l.a. times is
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.960]  reporting
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.200]  that no the corner is looking at foul play not saying that's what happened
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.960]  but is going to look at all the bases including
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]  murder
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.280]  well that's what you're supposed to do
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.840]  it's a week with wittany houston they say that they're going to spend six to
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.480]  eight weeks on this because
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:30.760]  they've got a test for everything the coroner thinks it's suspicious
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.720]  now expanding on this
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.520]  getting back to the birth certificate
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:38.280]  they countered you by releasing in a week before your book comes out for those
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.440]  that just joined us
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.880]  they had a squire come out and say the book had been recalled and had them
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.920]  just to try to sabotage it they were acting like
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.520]  this evidence would be completely damning
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.680]  because it is and then they released
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.040]  was it hubris was it arrogance
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.440]  was it that it was so compartmentalized that they just use some moron in there
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.840]  uh... i mean maybe it is a trap they're going to release another one later
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.660]  but then they'll be so discredited by that i mean i i i just think
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:08.160]  it's good old-fashioned hubris what does your gut tell you about this because
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.640]  there's so many frauds and anomalies
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:13.440]  the problem is this is is even covering them all
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.920]  a hubris i agree with you alex i think it's also
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.080]  a calculation of the mainstream media will
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.960]  pander to obama
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.760]  and call anybody who dares criticize obama racist
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.600]  scare everybody off
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.240]  you know and then they'll be no real investigation
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.320]  it meanwhile obama sets in the white house and laughs at everybody
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.200]  we're also going to have the uh... pilot investigation just beginning
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.720]  to have a whole series of revelations
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.840]  uh... there
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.520]  testimony is being developed
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.120]  that the white house is intimidating
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.880]  in a systematic way the mainstream media
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.800]  if anybody any broadcasters dare
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.560]  going to this birth or story
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.520]  they're gonna risk
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.920]  fcc investigations people
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.760]  have the careers ruined thrown off the air
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.280]  mean we're developing information on that as well as
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.700]  yes the work on a errors

[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.080]  we were conspiracy theorist four years ago
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.440]  to point out this very satirical name now they float in the media we was known
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.520]  as very satirical he did change his name he did get an indian citizenship we
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.480]  can only do that if you drop your u.s. the fact is this guy
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.400]  has got
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.800]  more identities

[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.920]  muslim all this his mother clearly was working for intelligence groups
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.340]  grandmothers involved at bank sending money
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.560]  i mean who is obama really because you're a former intelligence guy

[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.320]  if you have to give a prime break down who is this guy really
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.280]  what we know is obama is not who he says he is
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.880]  that's what we know for sure
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.840]  the cia a m prince and look at his mother shows up in indonesia
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.280]  takes his child to indonesia during the insolent
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.520]  civil wars
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.400]  five hundred thousand christians being slaughtered
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.600]  here they come being put into
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.320]  you know the insecure part of the city where the government of the
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.760]  intelligence workers live in bangkok
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.280]  uh... his mother

[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.360]  the cia
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.920]  i mean this is an environment which you gotta wonder
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.680]  what's brock obama as a child bary satoro
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.120]  doing in this environment makes no sense at all
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.760]  and then who paid it
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:12.520]  for
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.400]  the satoros to bring the child over there
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.200]  read the i n s file these people had no no money at all
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.560]  brock obama bary satoro comes back he registers
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.760]  at punahoo
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.760]  who pays this expensive
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.120]  private school
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.520]  in hawaii
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.560]  but it goes on and on
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.600]  there was a record of who it's an identity theft case
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.720]  did brock obama forges
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:40.200]  selective service registration card because he didn't read years after you say
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.440]  it comes out even in the evening and that his dad wasn't
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.120]  really married it was a sham they sent him back
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.640]  uh... it comes out that his names bary satoro it comes out that the birth
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.440]  certificate was cut out in kenyan meaning it was there
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.800]  i mean all of it is right there
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.960]  and you're right the media for three years again i go back to this said
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.960]  you've seen the birth certificate to show their lying hoaxing
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.760]  if we've seen it for three years and what's this new one
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.320]  we're right without any critical examination
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.800]  this is a political mainstream media and you can take what
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.240]  you know the washington post of new york times as you might as well read it
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.440]  as the old product under the soviet union
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.240]  it's government propaganda it's not news
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.080]  it's it's censored
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.360]  only the news
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.480]  the government wants you to hear and anything the government doesn't want
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.280]  you to hear is heavily censored
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.920]  this is not a first amendment free press
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.280]  it goes on and on
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.560]  mother father
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.800]  brock obama senior and uh... no it no indication they were married nothing
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.840]  liking
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.320]  looks nothing like a
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.280]  mean truthfully looks more like malcolm x's as for it means that you know it's and
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.640]  then there's questions
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.800]  who in fact
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.320]  whose child is it really because the i n s says
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.480]  that if this is back in nineteen sixty one of and on them
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.440]  were to apply for brock obama senior the father to stay in the u.s. because he's
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.800]  married to a
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.520]  u.s. citizen and on them
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.080]  as u.s. citizen child
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.840]  the i n s doesn't believe it and they're going to contest it
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.560]  they don't think they're married in it they don't think this baby
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.800]  is brock obama seniors child
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.600]  so whose child is it
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.400]  i mean these are all answered questions president of the united states
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.840]  if he applied
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.080]  for a job
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.600]  it's careful piles office he couldn't have been hired

[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.680]  it would take his
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.000]  a social security number to put it through e-verify it doesn't verify
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.280]  it's issued and there's going to be information on this coming out
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.640]  it just wasn't ready in the press conference
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.440]  don't assume that what president what

[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.040]  iran
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.440]  i don't like
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.960]  things the moolah's do i'm not saying iran's some great country but it's people
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.960]  are good folks just like americans just like russians
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.360]  it's like mexicans chinese brazilians
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.520]  uh... australians were all just humans we all have children we all want to live
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.600]  and have a better future
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.520]  and i don't like the fact that british intelligence and kermit roosevelt
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.140]  helped overthrow iran
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:55.400]  when mom and mozadek was pro-west but he wanted sovereignty
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.920]  and i don't like the fact that they
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.480]  did the whole iran contra thing with the moolah's all of it
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.440]  but it's it's not like you're either with iran
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.960]  or you're with america you've got these globalist interest that when we attack
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.360]  iran
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.360]  are going to use that attack to take our liberties here at home they've
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.920]  admitted
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.520]  and then i ran has said they're going to strike back
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.800]  so they want to stage any false flags they're gonna have some real events
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.800]  and then it's going to be used as a power grab and i'm sick of it i want my
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.560]  bill of rights a constitution
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.920]  obama's got the india he's launching wars he's putting al-qaeda in charge of
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.720]  libya
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.280]  using them against syria i don't like a side the point is they're putting stuff
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.240]  worse in in egypt
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.080]  now i understand
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:40.080]  that it iran was to be the big power i got the fact that israel feels threatened
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.240]  by that i know israel gets attacked by
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240]  by has below the tyranian run
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.960]  i know it iran's had its low intensity war against israel so israel's got their
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.080]  war inside there
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.320]  you know it's going on both ways
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.760]  but but you know doctor court see i know i know you're supportive of israel i'm
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.280]  not an enemy of israel
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.440]  i'm like ron paul i just want to stay out of this and be left alone
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.520]  what you know i think i think our positions are getting
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.080]  uh... closer together i mean i i'm
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.220]  maintaining
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:08.480]  the brock obama is intentionally
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.040]  taking every step necessary to cause a war to happen
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.480]  in the in the middle east exactly while acting like he's against it okay break
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.200]  down what's happening to give us a large picture for people that don't
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.800]  understand all the factors together
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:23.280]  but large that is that we start with this arab spring which
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.920]  you know the white house it's uh... you know proclaim was this great burst of
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.880]  democracy in the middle east
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:29.880]  it wasn't
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.680]  it's the muslim brotherhood systematically taking over
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.920]  and clamping down with islamic regimes that will develop over the next year or
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.520]  two
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.880]  you see it happening in egypt right now
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:41.640]  egypt
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.480]  you're going to get with the barricade
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.200]  egypt is now moving closer to iran
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.560]  they're they're going to
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.080]  throughout kill christians
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:55.200]  as united states and if you haven't seen the pyramids already forget about it
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.080]  don't dare go to egypt you
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.560]  threatened your life
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:01.320]  go back to june two thousand nine
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.520]  we have the
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.400]  green movement in the streets of tehran
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.080]  uh... we've had wasabi who lost of
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.760]  a fraudulent election
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.080]  avidine john
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.720]  and president obama instead of picking up the phone and saying i support the
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.920]  green movement
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.360]  sat in the white house and sat in his hands intentionally
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.680]  knowing that the iranian regime would crush the green movement
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.640]  that was the greatest chance to do it
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.880]  actually i'll both agree the greatest chance
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.080]  for freedom in iran is that the people of iran
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.760]  get rid of this regime and put in their own
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.160]  democratic regime
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.280]  which the iranian people the persians around the world
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.480]  would support with great enthusiasm
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.160]  obama blocked it intentionally
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.280]  because he did not want
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.480]  any force for positive change of freedom or peace moving into the middle east
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.080]  he preferred the mullahs
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:52.960]  he supported the mullahs by his silence
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.840]  now he's got the you know the building up
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.360]  he's going to go after a song
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.960]  ever so is that great is going after an enemy of iran
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:02.960]  wait a minute who are these rebels
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.520]  these rebels are the muslim brotherhood
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.920]  all that obama is doing is trading
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.560]  you know friend of
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.680]  uh... iran
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.000]  uh... with
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.720]  the muslim brotherhood
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.720]  is to run syria
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.360]  it'll still be radical
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.600]  it'll still support hezbollah
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.680]  in lebanon
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.280]  but they're gonna kill the christians and jews that have lived peacefully in syria
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.200]  they've said they are
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.360]  and this isn't even on the news
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.560]  this isn't even on the news and i mean my my my whole point is
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.120]  is that they're trying to sow total discord anarchy and craziness
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.800]  in the middle east and what's that going to do the gas prices i mean that
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.960]  okay so that we're gonna have a war and the war is already started i think in a
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.200]  covert war
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.440]  now we have a war
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.880]  the war is going to at least involve an attempt to shut down the straits of our
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.760]  moves
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.080]  which about forty percent of the world's oil supply goes through every day
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.320]  going on
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.440]  i mean you could double war shooting war starts
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.000]  wherever oil is at that time four dollars
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.800]  eight dollars i mean that that's conceivable to me
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.840]  and remember alex
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.840]  when i wrote
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.240]  black gold stranglehold i predicted the oil would be a hundred dollars a barrel
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.440]  that was in two thousand five six
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.560]  and everybody said i was crazy in a year and a half later you're right
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.880]  and today
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.280]  all of a hundred dollars barrels considered normal
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.800]  there's absolutely no reason for this except that
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.120]  the new world order
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.720]  the geopolitical system
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.480]  wants to take every last dollar
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.280]  out of the u.s european so they can but but but but but i didn't buy it up well
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.600]  i mean as you said look at warren buffett
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.360]  who stands to make billions a year office trains taking the oil
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.200]  to the west coast of canada to china so he has obama kill a already
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.280]  almost complete pipeline
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.520]  i mean it's a little economic sabotage foreign enemies could not do stuff like
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.960]  this but we were
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.960]  intentionally the new world order is in the white house if anybody thinks that
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.240]  president obama
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.320]  even there stands the constitution the crazy
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.360]  has no regard for the constitution
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.320]  president obama
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.040]  maybe aspiring to be
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:06.040]  you know president of the united nations secretary general clinton has said
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.700]  that we'll look at how he launched the war
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.720]  and congress will give you authorization he said i have the u n that
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.640]  was reason i have the u n authority i don't need you congress and they've
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.200]  been systematically both
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.560]  you know it's been going on even george w boys signing treaties avian flu
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.240]  we're under the control of the u n
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.800]  this whole united nations control
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:28.680]  the global control that's what happened in europe
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.120]  said in europe when the
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.680]  crisis was going on
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.120]  new world order would use it
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.020]  to take away the sovereignty of nations now
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.880]  grease cannot even decide its own budget
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:42.000]  the same thing is going to go on when a war occurs with iran
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  the minute that war starts
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  you're gonna have oil spike tremendously and obama is going to show up on the
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:48.800]  tv
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.960]  and pretend he's the great savior
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:53.040]  when the react you know the truth is
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:57.360]  obama caused this war to happen and he'll release a little bit of the
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.040]  strategic oil supply act like he's a savior
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.700]  and what a joke that is
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.000]  you know the fact is
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.680]  obama's lying left and right say although
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.080]  we're getting more independence on foreign oil look at him on the india
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.680]  he said i'm against it he demanded it then he said he wouldn't sign it then
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.600]  he's signed it
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.520]  and you know the whole deal here is
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.280]  we're using less oil
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.720]  that's the only reason we have a higher percentage of oil that's been from u.s
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.680]  production
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:24.800]  in the meantime
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.720]  we're shutting down coal plants
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.480]  we won't do the pipeline
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.600]  we don't have any drilling going off either shore
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.040]  this administration is
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.480]  desperately intent
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.520]  on increasing the price of oil why do the big insiders the crony capitalists
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.560]  that work with socialist extremists of every band
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.280]  why do they want to destroy europe the united states
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.760]  well first of all they know they're going to be on the inside
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.960]  so while the money is being stolen
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.440]  uh... they're going to get their cut
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.240]  look at all these cylinders i'm estimated it must have been at least
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.200]  forty billion dollars stolen out of the
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:04.560]  uh... seven eight hundred seventy eight billion dollar stimulus fund that's a
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.000]  conservative estimate
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.680]  given to the supporters
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.880]  of obama look at the eight billion a year akron was getting you don't think
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:14.320]  brightbart made enemies cutting off that it's all there's all their city
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.200]  machines
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.120]  precisely by the way brightbart
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.800]  we're preparing to offer some
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.640]  resources to the family to get some really top corners look at this
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.640]  you know i'm all good is getting
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.000]  the entire
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.560]  month of his life that we're on the entire month
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.840]  somebody can put me the drugs the intelligence agencies and others have
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.800]  developed
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.000]  brightbart could have been injected with something toxic
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.520]  a month ago that would cause a heart attack as if it were today and it's
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:44.080]  materialized out now yeah i don't want to look at just the last 24 hours
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.200]  you know i'm i'm well i'm i want to investigate more but that's what the
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.280]  coroner says he's doing a six to eight week he says he's going to go deep
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:54.400]  he thinks there could be something there well i think there is something i
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.920]  think that's what we got to find out
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.320]  you know i'm an investigator reporter it's like
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.120]  i'm trained that your mother says she loves you you better find another source
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.880]  i want to know isn't it suspicious to you that they announced within two hours it
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.400]  was totally natural just out of the blue and that the media ran with that
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.640]  absolutely you know that we're supposed to believe a 43 year old healthy 43 year
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.760]  old drops over and he's had heart problems and all these other it's working too
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.560]  hard well look a lot of people at 43 years old have heart problems and work
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.800]  very hard but don't keel over a catastrophic heart attack today they're
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.200]  going to release footage that'll quote destroy the president
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.400]  precisely you know and again one of the meetings is we better watch our
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.320]  security that was the discussion and share of our
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.400]  piles office immediately after bright part's death was announced
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.600]  all right i've got a report i'm going to get to on the state police and a new
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.360]  boondoggle they've got with gunboats but but stay there i want to do a few more
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.400]  minutes with you to recap and and any other points you want to make on where
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.520]  the economy is going and how to turn it around and what tricks you think obama
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.560]  is going to play not a durum course he's our guest
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.760]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:07.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.520]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:15.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.360]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:27.440]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:31.280]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.480]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.400]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.280]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.400]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:33.600]  it the world is getting so crazy we only got a
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.000]  few minutes left with dr corcy bottom line how do you see all this unfolding
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.480]  what are some of the possible probable uh in your analysis
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:47.920]  futures that we see here uh with the economy with all of it i mean will the
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.920]  globalist will the crony capitalist who are waging war against all free
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.480]  societies and funding all sorts of radical groups will they be successful
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:01.120]  in converting the western world into a high-tech police state and in doing all
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:04.000]  this it's going to be a very desperate last
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.200]  battle here they're going to run very fast to the finish line
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.200]  i'd watch for economies going to continue to deteriorate
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.880]  more and more people are going to have lose their jobs struggle with monthly
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.640]  payments but yet the unemployment figures are going to be
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.520]  continually manipulated you're going to see either close to
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.200]  8.5 percent whatever they can maintain by
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.720]  increasing the number of people that the bureau labor statistics
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.880]  says are out of the labor pool a lot of manipulation of data
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:38.880]  a lot of lies about how the so-called recovery
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.720]  there isn't any recovery what there is is a deepening
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:47.520]  depression in the housing market there's growing dependence on the government
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.240]  and by the way anybody who thinks that obama is going to
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.760]  maintain their government dependence after he wins
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:58.240]  reelection is a fool that's when the food stamp programs get
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.120]  that's when obama starts intervening to reduce
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.560]  unemployment benefits this is a trap a trap
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:07.760]  interdependency in the government member with health care they said they
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.800]  wouldn't do it and now they admit death panels now they admit
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.320]  once things are socialized they control it all and give all the extra money
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:18.000]  to the banker bailouts not to the people that's right and you know here
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.440]  comes the um we're going to be discussing a is a great
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  length both with the cold case policy and i'm going to be writing about it more
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.360]  on wad well as soon as you told me you're gonna
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:32.400]  when that article comes out you said you're gonna come here first you promise
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.360]  i promise you got my word you will be here first
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:41.040]  at the alex jones show and look alex the airs with you know there are tapes out
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.320]  there with airs the weather undergrounding wanting to exterminate
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:47.840]  23 million people arrest everybody reeducation camps
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.720]  i've had communists on the street tell me they're gonna get me
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.960]  and that they're gonna do this and look after this you think obama wins again
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.680]  you think they'll be a drone course you're writing a w and d or wd or an alex
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.520]  jones show they're gonna clamp down cast unsteen admits at the white house
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.920]  they're gonna shut down anybody that criticizes them
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:09.520]  he says if you criticize electric cars they'll shut you down
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.960]  i mean no one's buying them would i'm not allowed to say that they closed down
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:15.840]  the vault the vault was a bad idea that's a government car
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.960]  obama promoted that entirely but look the lies on the economy are going to
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.800]  continue and intensify and people got to look through to see the lies
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.680]  because it's going to be a rush to the finish to
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.600]  pretty up this new world order until it collapses
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:35.120]  and when it collapses either right before right after the election
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.440]  there'll be a big rush for power try to get everybody into fear that they're
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:42.880]  going to lose all they own well the goal by the way
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.000]  is to take everybody's private property away from them anyway
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  that's where the socialists exactly they keep you in a trap of too big to fail
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.960]  i'm gonna have to get you back up just on the economic front dr coursey thank

[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.400]  they said we're not talking to you those they had like three news cameras out
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.760]  there other news agencies lying in others locally
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:42.240]  they said you're not media you say you're on 590 but you're not
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.080]  and we're like okay i mean because when we called
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.680]  last time they said well what are you on and then he goes i know who alex jones
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:54.720]  is but i'm not on the air again so so it's like this mind game
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.320]  where we're trying to report on the boats and how the drug war is all a fraud
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:01.040]  and how the bigger the drug war gets the more drugs are on our streets and the
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.240]  troops are growing the opium in afghanistan and their response is this
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:10.080]  so so here is that report now we're here for the unveiling of yet another dps
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:13.680]  patrol vessel now this is the second boat of what will
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.520]  eventually be a total of six 34 foot shallow water
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:22.480]  interceptors to patrol the real grand river as the texas highway patrol goes
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.760]  on a wild spinning spree these hot rod boats cost
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:29.920]  approximately six hundred thousand dollars each and yes that's taxpayer
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.720]  money to fight those machine guns all-time drug
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:35.920]  traffickers on the texas rivers they're buying these
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:40.320]  giant six hundred and ninety something thousand dollar speed boats
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:46.400]  for lakes and rivers that have giant machine guns mounted all over them
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:50.160]  and they didn't have the machine guns mounted three months ago when we first
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.680]  went out and talked to in a lake they didn't know who we were we did a nice
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:57.600]  interview put it on tv i made my points about how
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:01.520]  they're we're going bankrupt but they're constantly militarizing our police
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:06.560]  darren mcgreen and john bell went out there politely and they were bowing up
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.120]  they were saying we're not going to talk to you know it was a press event that
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.440]  they called they had state police standing right up in their space
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.320]  and when they left they had state police follow them
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:21.040]  out of the parking lot over by the lake i mean here's here's my deal man
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:24.400]  i mean you guys miss the representatives that was with kelby j i called them and
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:27.600]  they're like no they don't work for us it's not a misrepresentation we're
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:31.920]  broadcast on klvj i mean this is a public place you're walking to film
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:35.520]  but there's not a there's there's not a media representative that'll talk to us
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:39.440]  no it goes on to say are john bound and darren mcgreen on your staff the dps
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.480]  contacted our d our dps contact and we're
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.320]  also affiliated with your show can you shed any light on this
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.160]  missus it's just crazy the state police are calling
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.680]  our local affiliate because wait the media is not supposed to ask us
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:59.120]  questions well wait a minute you're not supposed to discuss what's going on
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.960]  you're supposed to take it you're supposed to
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.480]  we give you a press release and you read it on air that's how america works we
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.840]  don't have a free press in america i mean i have some talking points if you
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.240]  want yeah some talking points um i think we got those pretty much
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:15.360]  last time i mean i i know the cost of the boats and
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.600]  all that yeah but we're we're just kind of wondering
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:21.600]  about joint military exercises stuff like that you know if there's any uh
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:25.520]  i mean you got to know yeah there's no joint military exercises i'm aware of
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:30.560]  there's been in six hundred thousand dollars on these six hundred plus
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:35.120]  yeah for and for a total of six of them and this is the unveiling of the
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.000]  second one with machine guns militarizing
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.840]  and they don't like it it's wrong to sit there and try to violate
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.520]  uh press freedom in this country can you believe calling up our affiliate
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:49.280]  trying to imply we're doing something wrong playing weird legalese games
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.880]  and by them following us it seemed like intimidation you know it was it was pure
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.720]  intimidation well i mean he's calling i know they plan on buying a lot of these
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.880]  unmanned drones uh dps is not that i'm aware of this
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.880]  the state is the state of texas you know weird because there's like border patrol
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.200]  with the drones and all that not federal well and but they work in with federal
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.880]  agencies that's what i mean so it'd be like homeland security for example is
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.480]  federal yet they provided a lot of the funding for these boats that are here
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:20.240]  in the state you know you know so so that's why i was wondering if there's
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.200]  any you know federal cooperation with these unmanned
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.480]  drones as well for border patrol and fighting these out of control drug wars
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:32.160]  uh yeah i don't know we don't have drones yeah now
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.520]  whose drones we have access to i might be sure
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.040]  rights activist or whatever also concerned that maybe these boats will be
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:42.720]  used to like pull over somebody to hey do you have your fishing license
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:46.080]  you know and you got all these tactical guns on there and and you have your
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:49.440]  fishing license it says boat registered is there any alcohol on board you know
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.640]  that sort of thing so those were kind of questions we're going to ask
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.560]  these are going to be used in standard border operations and cooperations
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.960]  all right let's stop right there local stake and look if they're going to use
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:04.000]  these for border operations that's one thing but they're
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.680]  they're basically just trying to stampede the sheep through a bunch of fear
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.040]  to allow the militarization just like getting rid of our bill of rights for
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.040]  al-qaeda now they say no it's for libertarians conservatives gun owners
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:18.080]  i mean now police departments are getting homeland security blimp some of them
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:22.080]  are like 30 feet long they're they're using drones on quote cattle thieves in
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.640]  north dakota look i know what's going on in every
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.080]  country the police and military end up taking over the people let them we're
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:34.000]  just trying to keep the police honest we want our bill of rights and constitution
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.920]  that's been trampled back great job with the crew listeners thank you so much
