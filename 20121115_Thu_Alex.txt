[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:44.320]  it is the 15th of November 2012 I am Alex Jones your host and I can
[00:44.320 --> 00:48.800]  undoubtedly with butterflies in my stomach which I never have even when
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.440]  I'm speaking to thousands of people in a hall I can unequivocally tell you that
[00:54.440 --> 01:00.680]  this is going to be the most important radio broadcast hands down that I have
[01:00.680 --> 01:08.160]  ever done now we have not been blindsided by the secession movement but
[01:08.160 --> 01:14.320]  it's almost like a bus that ran me over ten years ago it's old news to us but
[01:14.320 --> 01:20.840]  the new news is that it is now breaking nationwide and worldwide and is a
[01:20.840 --> 01:31.640]  symbol and a indicator of the sleeping giant that is America awakening and the
[01:31.640 --> 01:38.880]  entire globalist program has been built and designed to block what you are
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.960]  about to see unfold I am going to make some announcements here today and I'm
[01:44.960 --> 01:52.840]  going to lay out plans for my deep study of the Constitution that can save this
[01:52.840 --> 02:04.320]  Republic if you execute them victory is in our grasp people don't know that
[02:04.320 --> 02:12.360]  they're in tyranny until it really starts to get bad ladies and gentlemen
[02:12.360 --> 02:18.920]  petitions to the White House under federal law have to be responded to when
[02:18.920 --> 02:23.240]  they reach a certain number it's now more than 15 states it was just seven
[02:23.240 --> 02:30.560]  last night that went past that threshold but secession itself is a red
[02:30.560 --> 02:39.840]  herring I hope you're listening to me what we really want is a new issuance of
[02:39.840 --> 02:47.600]  the Declaration of Independence signed July 4th 1776 the purest American values
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.720]  the purest essence of the United States was secession from a corrupt distant
[02:53.720 --> 03:02.840]  corporate empire backed up by military force we are recaptured by the progeny
[03:02.840 --> 03:12.360]  by the literal and figurative offspring of those robber barons 235 years ago we
[03:12.360 --> 03:17.280]  are at the crossroads and the entire enemy battle plan that we've reverse
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.320]  engineered is designed to suppress states rights movements because the
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.280]  states created the federal government and it is not their right it is not
[03:27.280 --> 03:33.640]  their duty we the people that make the states it is an absolute imperative
[03:33.640 --> 03:45.120]  beyond duty it is survival that we secede from the new world order that has
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.640]  conquered us through fraud that we declare the fraud and declare the fraud
[03:49.640 --> 03:56.280]  null and void and then reconstitute the Republic with a new Congress of the
[03:56.280 --> 04:06.080]  several states a new Declaration of Independence we can't wait till July 4th
[04:06.080 --> 04:10.560]  and everything we've moved forward with with a nullification movement the
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.560]  states rights movement the system has prepared for this and sold Obama as the
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.960]  next Lincoln and and said any states rights movement is civil war Glen Beck
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.560]  is saying it's illegal in civil war it is the essence of America and there's a
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.800]  new Ron Paul video he put out this morning at info wars.com that we just
[04:30.800 --> 04:35.640]  posted so hit refresh where he says secession is the ultimate American
[04:35.640 --> 04:43.240]  value America is already gone we must recognize that pull out of the new
[04:43.240 --> 04:49.560]  world order prosecute the criminals that have hijacked the Republic who don't
[04:49.560 --> 04:55.480]  flee and then reconstitute the Republic but we must first separate or die to
[04:55.480 --> 05:02.960]  then rejoin we'll be back stay with us the silver lungs generator is the only

[08:50.560 --> 08:57.320]  it ladies and gentlemen we have warned of this we have exposed it we have seen
[08:57.320 --> 09:04.600]  the globalist preparations and now things are unfolding exactly as we knew
[09:04.600 --> 09:13.280]  they would but last night at about midnight after rewatching Ron Paul's
[09:13.280 --> 09:20.480]  most powerful and thought-provoking speech his farewell speech watching it
[09:20.480 --> 09:23.160]  for the second time last night we're gonna play some excerpts coming up
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.480]  today everything crystallized I already knew it intellectually I'd already set
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.640]  it on air a hundred times in different ways but it hit me with that
[09:32.640 --> 09:40.800]  electricity I've only felt a few other times in my life the knowing the knowing
[09:40.800 --> 09:47.760]  the the absolute destiny of this Republic the the conviction that if I
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.680]  prosecute the war against the new world order if you take up the info war and
[09:54.680 --> 10:01.640]  discredit and expose the enemy and take up states rights and take up a new
[10:01.640 --> 10:07.560]  declaration of independence the plans were laid by our forebears the first
[10:07.560 --> 10:11.000]  amendment the second amendment the fourth amendment the tenth amendment the
[10:11.000 --> 10:18.560]  ninth amendment all chief all key all armaments for our protection for seeing
[10:18.560 --> 10:25.200]  the crisis we've now entered the enemy's tools is a dumbed-down population a drug
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.840]  the population a selfish evil greedy weak population and they don't even
[10:30.840 --> 10:37.320]  outnumber us it's a fraudulent election system we know that if the parasites
[10:37.320 --> 10:43.600]  didn't have the producers they would fall and we are now here at the crossroads
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.600]  and we have Edwin V. Erra joining us constitutional lawyer at the start of
[10:49.600 --> 10:53.960]  the next hour we have Lerak well joining us as well and I'm going to make some
[10:53.960 --> 10:58.080]  huge announcements here and then try to be calm and walk through this I've
[10:58.080 --> 11:04.560]  written like seven pages of notes here I want to go over with you here today now
[11:04.560 --> 11:11.240]  this is not complex but this is not dumbed-down radio this is a blueprint and
[11:11.240 --> 11:20.880]  if constitutional lawyers pick this up if Ron Paul can be drafted if you put
[11:20.880 --> 11:25.200]  the energy in today tomorrow next week next month next year this is this is the
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.680]  beginning we've everything else has just been a build-up with the orchestra
[11:31.680 --> 11:43.600]  tuning up before the orchestra begins their true presentation we are at the
[11:43.600 --> 11:51.520]  threshold of absolute history we are plunging into bona fide certified
[11:51.520 --> 12:01.360]  razor sharp total evil Obama did something off the charts today he signed
[12:01.360 --> 12:08.080]  a secret executive order handing over the internet to the NSA and foreign
[12:08.080 --> 12:17.080]  banks unprecedented we are now going under emergency rule right now this is
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.960]  all been planned out all wargamed but we through historical research and
[12:22.960 --> 12:26.560]  thousands of whistleblowers from inside the system many of which were killed or
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.920]  imprisoned remember many people died to bring you this information the only
[12:31.920 --> 12:36.120]  reason I'm alive right now is because people were willing in the 50 60 70s
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.160]  and 80s to be imprisoned and killed they killed thousands of people they
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.680]  arrested congressmen and tortured them they they they hijacked aircraft and
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.280]  handed over congressmen to the North Koreans they to try to keep this down
[12:50.280 --> 13:00.760]  those of us that came before the current awakening we stand on their shoulders so
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.320]  this isn't a game I want to telegraph that to you right now and what I'm
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.200]  going to say today and what I'm taking up now is the most dangerous thing I've
[13:10.200 --> 13:16.000]  ever done and I feel no fear I only feel fear that I will not execute this
[13:16.000 --> 13:28.720]  properly and it's not fear it is more of a gripping bracing realization as if the
[13:28.720 --> 13:38.600]  hand of God is wrapped around my heart saying don't screw this up you may be
[13:38.600 --> 13:48.480]  killed doing this so in your greatest moment of resistance ringing the bell
[13:48.480 --> 13:54.200]  signaling the beginning of the second American Revolution the restoration and
[13:54.200 --> 14:00.480]  the spirit of 1776 don't screw this up Jones and I'll tell all of you this as
[14:00.480 --> 14:07.360]  well you don't screw it up either this is time for dedication this is time for
[14:07.360 --> 14:15.240]  commitment and the spiritual decision to sign your John Hancock in your words
[14:15.240 --> 14:21.120]  and your deeds towards the restoration of our Republic and putting us back on
[14:21.120 --> 14:33.440]  the course of liberty and justice for all and what am I going to call for here
[14:33.440 --> 14:38.320]  I'm going to call for what is in the Declaration of Independence the founding
[14:38.320 --> 14:52.800]  document of July 4th 1776 that is what I'm calling for it is America it is the
[14:52.800 --> 14:59.280]  birth of America it is when it all started and we have the tools we have
[14:59.280 --> 15:06.440]  the information we have all of it before us in our hands if we will only take it
[15:06.440 --> 15:14.000]  up from this inspired document the example of freedom worldwide and breathe
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.560]  life back into it and set those brush fires in the minds of men and women
[15:19.560 --> 15:23.880]  everywhere let me lay out some basic facts here before I get into the battle
[15:23.880 --> 15:29.680]  plan in the info war and the enemy will undoubtedly try to physically come down
[15:29.680 --> 15:36.360]  upon us but that is part of the historical tide and that is another
[15:36.360 --> 15:42.400]  sign of our victory the 1.6 billion bullets the checkpoints the foreign
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.080]  troops the army admitting reeducation camps that's a sign of failure and
[15:47.080 --> 15:56.080]  weakness of the collectivist Borg corporate Bankster state the poison they
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.120]  poured out upon us their venom that was meant to paralyze those of us that love
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.720]  liberty has only energized us while paralyzing and fogging their vision they
[16:05.720 --> 16:09.920]  are confounded they are confused they are believing their own propaganda and
[16:09.920 --> 16:17.200]  lies but I see in their eyes the seeds of their destruction and their failure if
[16:17.200 --> 16:24.240]  only you will take up the gifts God has given us the weapons that God gave our
[16:24.240 --> 16:31.800]  forebears so long lying in their armories collecting dust we will resurrect
[16:31.800 --> 16:37.400]  these mighty weapons and we will use them tirelessly against the enemy we
[16:37.400 --> 16:42.720]  will prosecute a war to restore the republic and run the money changers
[16:42.720 --> 16:48.560]  from the temple now here are some of the points I'm going to break down and I
[16:48.560 --> 16:52.080]  know Paul Watson and others are going to be codifying this into action plans and
[16:52.080 --> 16:58.360]  articles number one Ron Paul the videos up at info wars.com has said
[16:58.360 --> 17:05.840]  secession is the essence of America and the birth of our republic it is more
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.000]  American than even George Washington because he flowed forth from that it is
[17:11.000 --> 17:23.240]  the fount the sinner the core the very blood of the republic it is July 4th it
[17:23.240 --> 17:31.640]  is the freedom it is the dignity it is the absolute sinner of the universe on
[17:31.640 --> 17:38.360]  this planet for liberty and resistance to tyranny it is our armor it is our
[17:38.360 --> 17:49.840]  mind it is our sword it is our shield it is our will now I will expose the trap
[17:49.840 --> 17:55.120]  the globalist or counterfeiters they will take secession and they will
[17:55.120 --> 18:01.560]  repackage it as civil war and as racism and you're already seeing that you
[18:01.560 --> 18:07.520]  already see them jumping on it they were ready it was the session from the
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.800]  British Empire by British citizens who were having their rights violated
[18:11.800 --> 18:19.680]  exactly as we are today after a long train of abuses that led to them pulling
[18:19.680 --> 18:26.480]  out of that corrupt system to form a new union to form a new system read the
[18:26.480 --> 18:31.120]  Declaration of Independence and then it was not just their right it was their
[18:31.120 --> 18:42.360]  duty to do so and so we're saying rediscover that reissue a new Declaration
[18:42.360 --> 18:47.880]  of Independence it may take a year it may take two years but accelerate the
[18:47.880 --> 18:53.440]  program the idea literally storm your state houses not demanding more
[18:53.440 --> 18:58.880]  government handouts but as we stormed them over the TSA last year and that's
[18:58.880 --> 19:03.320]  what the media called it marching in not asking demanding that they throw the
[19:03.320 --> 19:08.080]  TSA out of our state unanimously voted in the house killed by Dewhurst in the
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.720]  Senate now we're have removed him and he lost his Senate race now they're back
[19:13.720 --> 19:17.760]  with even more votes in the Senate we are going to force the issue with the
[19:17.760 --> 19:22.600]  globalist because here's the key we're not seceding from the federal government
[19:22.600 --> 19:28.520]  we are recognizing and declaring what is self-evident that the federal
[19:28.520 --> 19:33.000]  government has been hijacked by foreign banking cartels you can go into the
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.280]  legislatures with the Times of London CNBC Time magazine hundreds of
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.560]  publications bragging we've been conquered so we are pulling out of the
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.680]  occupied false federal New World Order system we are seceding from the New
[19:49.680 --> 19:55.360]  World Order hijackers to reconstitute the Republic I have the battle plan
[19:55.360 --> 20:01.040]  we're going to draft Ron Paul stay with me call everyone you know have you ever

[20:12.640 --> 20:16.640]  systems provide life-saving electrical power unlike gas generators a solar
[20:16.640 --> 20:20.760]  generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the Sun
[20:20.760 --> 20:24.400]  it's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home

[25:37.720 --> 25:43.040]  gonna enforce the law and I'll let TSA stick their hands down people's pants
[25:44.800 --> 25:54.720]  well I tell you what we're going to do then we're going to send in F-16s to
[25:54.720 --> 25:57.560]  shoot down aircraft to try to enter Texas I mean that was last year the
[25:57.560 --> 26:03.040]  federal government's out of control it's been taken over they brag in hundreds
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.280]  of publications that America's been conquered the post-America world on and
[26:08.280 --> 26:12.720]  on and on 50 years ago the richest nation in the world the highest education
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.200]  highest IQ longest lived now we're at the back of the pack we have been
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.480]  overrun by criminals with a bunch of fancy propaganda and Ron Paul gave a
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.960]  speech yesterday is farewell where he said we have state-run media they've
[26:26.960 --> 26:32.120]  set up FEMA camps we're going into world government that's what's gonna cure
[26:32.120 --> 26:38.160]  this is slamming the facts down because they're right there not listening to
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.760]  some of the people a campaign for liberty that have tried to infiltrate
[26:40.760 --> 26:43.440]  it saying don't talk about world government don't you know work with the
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.840]  system oh Obama's got a mandate thank God Ron Paul's taking campaign for
[26:47.840 --> 26:51.680]  liberty back over and listen I'm gonna lay out my battle plan we come back from
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.920]  break I'm so excited I've just given you some of the basic facts here but I'm
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.160]  gonna tell you this call everyone you know whether you're listening on a local
[26:59.160 --> 27:08.800]  AM or FM station whether you are listening on XM 168 whether you are
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.600]  tuning 166 excuse me whether you are listening on the internet streams at
[27:14.600 --> 27:19.880]  prismplanet.com or info wars.com call everyone you know and tell them to tune
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.480]  in now because I've got a battle plan based on history based on our
[27:24.480 --> 27:28.560]  republic based on our Bill of Rights and Constitution and based on the fact
[27:28.560 --> 27:32.280]  that we have close to double the nations that we had a hundred years ago
[27:32.280 --> 27:36.640]  because people want freedom and when you've got a corrupt central government
[27:36.640 --> 27:41.360]  Mexico used to be twice the size it is now not not in the north in the south
[27:41.360 --> 27:48.240]  Guatemala and other countries peeled off that is the natural thing is to when
[27:48.240 --> 27:54.840]  you get your federal government hijacked you pull out then you reconstitute and
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.800]  then you go restore the federal government I mean look if foreign enemies
[27:59.800 --> 28:03.320]  parachuted in and took over the White House and the Congress and announced
[28:03.320 --> 28:06.280]  where your new government like something out of America with a K with
[28:06.280 --> 28:09.800]  Chris Christoferson you would say hey the states have got to get together to
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.280]  go kick these guys out that's not our legitimate government that wouldn't be
[28:13.280 --> 28:19.600]  secession that would be the states organizing to reconstitute the republic
[28:19.600 --> 28:27.040]  but to do that they've got to exercise their state's rights of secession not
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.400]  secession to make Texas its own country not secession to make Oklahoma its own
[28:31.400 --> 28:37.560]  country not secession to make Missouri its own country or Illinois secession to
[28:37.560 --> 28:41.560]  say here's our Bill of Rights and Constitution that our state constitutions
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.640]  are based on this is what we follow not the UN not the New World Order not the
[28:46.640 --> 28:53.600]  Patriot Act not the NDAA Federal Reserve out New World Order out get out look at
[28:53.600 --> 28:56.880]  how they set the euro up to get the countries and debt fraudulently sign
[28:56.880 --> 29:00.400]  them on to bank or debt implode them and bring them into a total super union
[29:00.400 --> 29:04.400]  under central bank private bank control they brag about that on Bloomberg TV
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.680]  that's all over the news they say the banks set up the euro to take it over
[29:08.680 --> 29:14.760]  they think you're so dumb this is all admitted so just I give praise to Ron
[29:14.760 --> 29:17.400]  Paul you know when you love somebody and you love what they've done if you get
[29:17.400 --> 29:21.560]  upset by some of the things you see some of the some of his supporters in the
[29:21.560 --> 29:26.440]  power structure do when you when you count on somebody then it's personal you
[29:26.440 --> 29:30.680]  get mad at him and I've gotten mad a little bit at Ron Paul to get him back
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.680]  to realize what had happened to his organization I did it quietly did it
[29:34.680 --> 29:40.680]  gently but now it's happening and I'm telling you we need to draft Ron Paul to
[29:40.680 --> 29:46.400]  lead the second Continental Congress of the States it's a new declaration of

[33:21.640 --> 33:25.440]  Ron Paul said in his speech yesterday that we're gonna play excerpts of after
[33:25.440 --> 33:29.920]  Edwin Vieira leaves us at the bottom of the next hour constitutional lawyer to
[33:29.920 --> 33:33.760]  break down our path towards victory against the globalist secession and
[33:33.760 --> 33:37.680]  reconstituting the Republic I'm gonna lay that plan out as calmly as I can
[33:37.680 --> 33:42.880]  here in a moment if you go to prison planet dot com and our info wars dot
[33:42.880 --> 33:48.720]  com Ron Paul secession is an American principal that videos up there in his
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.240]  final speech Ron Paul warns of continuous march towards fascism that's a
[33:53.240 --> 33:58.120]  Steve Watson article that's a quote he said this is a conscious sound like I
[33:58.120 --> 34:01.200]  wrote the speech I know we're on the same page but man Ron Paul really gets it
[34:01.200 --> 34:07.480]  this is a conscious tyrannical planned seizure takeover by world
[34:07.480 --> 34:13.160]  government conquering the US and God bless him he's told the truth and laid
[34:13.160 --> 34:17.960]  it out we're not gonna beat these people like the media says oh go join the
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.720]  Democrats call for socialism that's all election fraud it's all a scam 12 to 15
[34:23.720 --> 34:29.280]  20 million the numbers are varied of Ron Paul libertarians didn't vote for
[34:29.280 --> 34:33.400]  Romney that's why he didn't get in because people aren't playing games
[34:33.400 --> 34:38.200]  anymore they're not buying three to five million guns a month and buying ammo
[34:38.200 --> 34:47.880]  and signing a million 200,000 petitions to secede because they're playing games
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.600]  anymore and I saw one of the top neocon talk show host I have his quotes here
[34:52.600 --> 35:00.000]  coming out and saying do not sign that petition the government will come
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.800]  rounds you up that's like telling John Hancock and Thomas Jefferson don't sign
[35:05.800 --> 35:09.160]  the Declaration of Independence here you see the Declaration of Independence
[35:09.160 --> 35:12.840]  give me a document cam shot guys I'm gonna sign this this is what it's all
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.240]  about I was up in hot springs last year on a three-day vacation with my family
[35:17.240 --> 35:20.800]  and they had constitutional woman's group there at one of the museums handing
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.280]  out free constitutions on Constitution Day and they gave you a chance to sign
[35:24.280 --> 35:30.360]  it and that's the point Alex Jones see that that's where you get freedom
[35:30.360 --> 35:34.320]  telling these bullies these scum these illegitimate New World Order trash
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.200]  we're not playing games with you let me read from this that these vampires
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.680]  don't like it's like high noon to them while evils are sufferable it goes on
[35:44.680 --> 35:46.920]  here
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.840]  people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government that whenever
[35:53.840 --> 35:57.000]  any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.760]  right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new
[36:00.760 --> 36:05.640]  government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers
[36:05.640 --> 36:11.600]  in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and
[36:11.600 --> 36:14.040]  happiness
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.680]  prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not
[36:20.680 --> 36:25.420]  be changed for light or transient causes and accordingly all experience has
[36:25.420 --> 36:31.000]  shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.800]  to write themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed or
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.720]  conditioned but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing
[36:39.720 --> 36:46.000]  invariably the same object invents is a design to reduce them under absolute
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.720]  despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such governments and
[36:50.720 --> 36:56.920]  to provide new guards for their future security and look I signed my name to it
[36:56.920 --> 37:04.960]  right here I signed my name to this sign your name it is a symbol God sees it
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.360]  printed out or if you got a parchment one hanging on the wall get in there and
[37:10.360 --> 37:15.800]  sign it in fact we've got back there parchment constitutions hanging I want
[37:15.800 --> 37:19.600]  them pulled off the wall I want the Declaration of Independence I'm when it
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.480]  pulled out of the frame I'm gonna sign it because that's what it's about I mean
[37:23.480 --> 37:29.040]  look at this headline when Beck says are you out of your mind they'll come
[37:29.040 --> 37:33.960]  round you up my God that man is a Benedict Arnold with stuff like that or
[37:33.960 --> 37:37.600]  maybe he's just a coward he's got like 30 security people I just go out to
[37:37.600 --> 37:40.760]  Bilderberg streets have a thousand people around me and people like that's
[37:40.760 --> 37:43.600]  crazy Jones why do you do that what do you tell folks we know where you're
[37:43.600 --> 37:49.800]  going we're gonna be his is in God's hands that's why the Tree of Liberty has
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.680]  to be refreshed with the blood of Patriots and tyrants and I'm not living
[37:53.680 --> 38:00.800]  in fear I'm shining my name on to Liberty and I'm in 110% I'm all in I'm
[38:00.800 --> 38:05.640]  doubling down there's no more backing off there's no more playing games there's no
[38:05.640 --> 38:12.160]  more half measures you're either for freedom or you're gonna be a slave now
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.400]  let me give you my plan and I want to start out first with how they're gonna
[38:15.400 --> 38:20.080]  counter strike you've seen it I told you for years John Warner Defense
[38:20.080 --> 38:23.360]  Authorization Act says for insurrection by the states governors and
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.880]  legislatures this is night this is 2007 they were getting ready for this this is
[38:27.880 --> 38:31.420]  a long-term plan when they were getting rid of posse commentatus getting
[38:31.420 --> 38:35.640]  brigade homeland set up 400,000 troops for domestic operations north comm
[38:35.640 --> 38:42.240]  standing up the drones all of the massive preparations that were going on
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.120]  and being established and being set up while all of this was going on they
[38:48.120 --> 38:54.080]  said in the 2007 John Warner Defense Authorization Act it says and I read it
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.360]  on air to you and he that they are preparing to block the states they're
[38:58.360 --> 39:01.080]  worried about the governor's counsel even though it's the most of them are
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.000]  their operatives because we could take that back over and that's the logical
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.200]  place to have a new Continental Congress of the states to restore the
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.800]  republic not a secession recognizing our government's been hijacked that's the
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.080]  key that's not words that's true they have declared they have conquered us
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.440]  that's a legal posting in over 200 newspapers I've seen in just the last
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.840]  year I've shown them Paul Watson I wrote the article bankers declare they've
[39:26.840 --> 39:30.840]  conquered Europe in the US our first issue of the magazine covered that
[39:30.840 --> 39:36.640]  bankers declare they've conquered us that is a legal posting these people are
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.640]  lawyers because they leave back doors escape patches for themselves that's
[39:41.640 --> 39:49.120]  why we understand their battle plan because this barrel of snakes follows a
[39:49.120 --> 39:55.360]  program to exempt themselves from their tyranny okay now listen to me they've
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.120]  got the military set they've got the military ready
[39:58.120 --> 40:01.280]  Britt Perry joked and said will succeed they put the military on alert
[40:01.280 --> 40:05.000]  surrounding states to invade good throw me in that briar patch let's get it on
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.880]  let's start it let's have you come in and knock some heads and put army on the
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.240]  streets let's get it going here not physical don't don't don't fight them
[40:14.240 --> 40:19.560]  when they do this let the redcoats occupy like they did for a decade before
[40:19.560 --> 40:26.040]  it really got going let the redcoats up come in let them rape women speak out
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.040]  against it if you see it happening you've got a moral duty to you know to
[40:29.040 --> 40:36.040]  defend the woman but no offensive attacks no offensive attacks let their
[40:36.040 --> 40:43.120]  evil flow continue they want to start the fight let them shoot first we have
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.640]  the moral high ground they'll probably stage them false flags to then blame
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.360]  and honest to so they can get the moral high ground continue to expose their
[40:51.360 --> 40:57.120]  main weapon that we've almost destroyed false flag we've false flag inside job
[40:57.120 --> 41:01.200]  staged event provocateur event it's now in the nomenclature it's now in the
[41:01.200 --> 41:07.480]  popular culture keep running that offense on them attack in all directions
[41:07.480 --> 41:11.020]  ladies and gentlemen we've been waiting to be fully surrounded we've been
[41:11.020 --> 41:16.080]  waiting for everything we warned to come to pass we fought against it while
[41:16.080 --> 41:22.800]  building next phase resistance systems okay that's why we said from deep
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.600]  behind enemy lines I know I'm in FEMA region 6 I know the globalists admit
[41:26.600 --> 41:30.000]  they conquered us decades ago with the National Security Act now they want to
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.080]  conquer you physically now they really want to break your will and break your
[41:34.080 --> 41:40.040]  back and get you ready for this and break you financially so you go on food
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.960]  stamps and go on welfare and ship all our jobs overseas and use banker bailout
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.640]  money to ship our jobs overseas everything was about bringing us down
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.920]  making us dependent demoralizing us breaking up our families making the
[41:53.920 --> 41:59.480]  general public these gibbering empty demons that get off on the idea of evil
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.520]  but squeal like little pigs when they get caught in the vice grips of something
[42:03.520 --> 42:09.520]  real who have no idea what real darkness is who have no idea what hell is really
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.800]  like have no idea what the stench of terror and he really smells like well
[42:13.800 --> 42:18.560]  you little fools are going to get to smell it
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.400]  the weak are fascinated and worship at the altar of evil because they believe
[42:24.400 --> 42:31.960]  it has power but once evil really gets turned loose they will beat their heads
[42:31.960 --> 42:37.560]  and pull their hair out and they will beg they will beg for justice and there
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.280]  will be none
[42:40.280 --> 42:48.280]  the wicked flee when none pursue the pit they've dug for us they will fall into
[42:48.280 --> 42:53.040]  now let me lay it out they're going to invoke race war you've seen it just you
[42:53.040 --> 42:55.920]  don't like government-run healthcare you're a racist you don't like world

[43:08.160 --> 43:13.400]  like the general public that will be the the globalist weapons system and their
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.680]  constituency their paramilitary police and the military are starting to wake up
[43:18.680 --> 43:22.280]  but still a lot of them are such authoritarians and drunk on power and
[43:22.280 --> 43:27.000]  drunk on the idea that they're moral and and drunk on the on the brainwashing
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.120]  they've been given that a lot of them will try to prosecute a war of
[43:30.120 --> 43:35.080]  intimidation against us and we've got a hold ladies and gentlemen it's like
[43:35.080 --> 43:38.560]  it's like Andrew Jackson said don't fire do you see the whites of their eyes
[43:38.560 --> 43:44.680]  politically just let them keep engaging us in abusing and stomping all over us
[43:44.680 --> 43:49.360]  and just document document document document document while moving
[43:49.360 --> 43:54.400]  politically to delegitimize them to expose them when they brag and post
[43:54.400 --> 43:58.200]  public notices that they've conquered us we've been conquered we've been taken
[43:58.200 --> 44:01.400]  over they're trying to mop up the media they put the internet kill switch in

[44:04.960 --> 44:08.960]  ready the new wars to try to get us to rally around the economic implosions all
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.680]  of it this is going to be one Hades of a fight but if we don't give up and keep
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.400]  pounding in the info war we're going to win now did you call everybody you know
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.520]  and tell them to tune in because I'm gonna lay this out the globalist will

[44:46.520 --> 44:50.360]  already saying arrest us there are and they've already sold the idea like eight
[44:50.360 --> 44:54.800]  movies that have come out and all these magazines that Obama's the Abraham Lincoln
[44:54.800 --> 44:58.560]  that there's gonna be a civil war and that he will stop the racist and the
[44:58.560 --> 45:04.520]  media saying it's secession 2.0 civil war we're gonna fight the graycoats we're
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.400]  gonna fight that that's already the branding it no no no we're not fighting
[45:08.400 --> 45:12.280]  graycoats and bluecoats this is northern or southern or western or black white
[45:12.280 --> 45:16.360]  Hispanic Asian if you want freedom if you want out from under socialism and

[45:38.120 --> 45:41.680]  stood up against tyrants we're fighting the same thing our ancestors fought over
[45:41.680 --> 45:45.360]  and over again in different permutations and the globalist demonize the Bill of
[45:45.360 --> 45:48.480]  Rights and Constitution because even though it was never fully implemented
[45:48.480 --> 45:55.160]  the ideas that it enshrines are anathema to the despot to the tyrant to the king
[45:55.160 --> 46:01.600]  rat and you are at the threshold you are the resistance you are the leaders
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.320]  they're going to invoke race war they're gonna invoke separation of men and
[46:07.320 --> 46:10.200]  women they're going to invoke more attacks on the family they're gonna
[46:10.200 --> 46:13.920]  hammer the economy and say give the bankers unlimited trillions of new

[46:18.040 --> 46:21.880]  people on welfare so that they've got to survive they're forcing us on to the
[46:21.880 --> 46:28.520]  plantation on to the slave reservation on to the control grid they are going to
[46:28.520 --> 46:34.120]  again say it is secession and that it's a violent and go find you know goofballs
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.320]  and guys out there on their little farm saying I'm the president of this I'm the
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.160]  president of that I'm the president of Oklahoma I'm the president of Texas I'm
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.240]  the president in Mexico to make it look kooky I'm laying out their battle
[46:46.240 --> 46:50.800]  plan I told you this was all coming they trained the military they trained
[46:50.800 --> 46:56.200]  North com for this they understand this is the remedy in the Constitution not
[46:56.200 --> 47:01.360]  some secession where some guy declares themselves the king of Texas but
[47:01.360 --> 47:06.680]  Texans saying the federal government has been hijacked by foreign globalists
[47:06.680 --> 47:10.800]  that have bragged that they've conquered us you go into the legislatures with
[47:10.800 --> 47:16.000]  papers with the examples of the news and the bankers announcing that there's a
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.640]  world government we've been conquered their announcement we've been conquered
[47:19.640 --> 47:22.520]  you go in with a declaration of independence saying it's our right
[47:22.520 --> 47:28.360]  and duty to throw this off you call for the state legislature associations the
[47:28.360 --> 47:33.720]  gubernatorial associations not the new 10 member FEMA governor's council that's
[47:33.720 --> 47:37.480]  the counterfeit over the governor's getting together or the rural affairs
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.640]  under Department of Defense Homeland Security to run the rural areas this is
[47:41.640 --> 47:47.320]  an emergency reorganization plan by design modeled after the Mao and Lenin
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.760]  Stalin takeovers of those countries and surrounding areas we know their attack
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.480]  profile we know their bombing runs we know their plan all we've got to do is

[48:20.720 --> 48:24.920]  purging our military right now because I know from high-level multiple sources
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.240]  and you've seen all the resignations that the military said no to this North
[48:28.240 --> 48:32.880]  Com takeover plan military said we're not gonna arrest governors and people
[48:32.880 --> 48:36.120]  we're not gonna arrest newspaper editors we're not gonna arrest talk show

[49:08.960 --> 49:13.320]  mainland of the US there'd be a rifle behind every blade of grass that's the
[49:13.320 --> 49:18.680]  execution of the military and the police by the globalist to bring us into
[49:18.680 --> 49:24.000]  total anarchy if the military and the police try to execute the gun
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.520]  confiscations that Obama and the NRA is documented has planned physical
[49:28.520 --> 49:33.720]  turn-ins of all semi-autos there will be a civil war when that starts it we will

[50:14.840 --> 50:18.160]  that want to be stars in a public party Ron Paul's retaking control of it they
[50:18.160 --> 50:23.520]  need to direct for a calm meeting of governors and legislatures circulating
[50:23.520 --> 50:27.600]  petitions circulating legislation that Ron Paul writes and and the other
[50:27.600 --> 50:33.640]  competing legislation to restore the Republic not secession but to recognize
[50:33.640 --> 50:37.320]  at the state level the globalists have seized our country they're overthrowing
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.720]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution we are not succeeding to destroy the
[50:40.720 --> 50:45.720]  Republic but to unite the Republic they want to build this is a civil war

[56:08.520 --> 56:14.080]  of the head and then the head has gone into all the parts and extracted the
[56:14.080 --> 56:20.200]  wealth you understand to bring it back to the head so that we've got this
[56:20.200 --> 56:26.880]  giant New World Order head and all these little parts of the states that are
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.080]  actually giant but but the state government itself has been made this
[56:30.080 --> 56:35.280]  little you know federal vestigial thing we have to separate from the hijacked
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.960]  globalist government and we have to go with the pieces of the states and
[56:40.960 --> 56:50.560]  constitute the new head and then we join you understand then we rejoin this has
[56:50.560 --> 56:56.080]  been seized everything is to explain this is hijacked this is fascist not in

[57:19.520 --> 57:24.240]  pulling out and and and get our message out that it's about restoring the
[57:24.240 --> 57:28.520]  Republic and kicking the globalist out the others will fall into place it will
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.280]  give other people moral courage in county city state government the federal
[57:32.280 --> 57:35.680]  government the generals have had courage saying no to all these new wars and

[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.840]  law and I wanted to get one of the chief recognized experts and you know one of
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.840]  the founders of the modern militia movement from a point of law on with
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.640]  us a man who's launched a lot of major major movements we see today based on
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:35.280]  what we saw 230 plus years ago but to restate it for stations that just joined
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.600]  us this is the most important broadcast we've ever done the manifestation of a
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.360]  million 200,000 and counting signatures by all 50 states now over 15 states
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.960]  qualifying for the White House to have to respond that is more than symbolic it
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.880]  shows the people saying we will not go under socialism we are not slaves this
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.240]  is all unconstitutional North com in DAA government health care written by
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.280]  foreign bank owned insurance companies we're not going along with this and Ron
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.800]  Paul and his incredible speech we're in place some excerpts coming up 49 minutes
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.920]  it's up at info wars.com he said we're under fascism it's premeditated it is
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.360]  psychopathic organized evil these are quotes by the way he said they are that
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.520]  it is world government they have announced all over the news we played
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.840]  the clips at nauseam where they say we've been conquered by foreign banks and
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.720]  laugh at us on CNBC Bloomberg TV financial Times of London this is a
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.360]  legal declaration just as Europe's been conquered by being signed on to banker
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:44.640]  derivatives we are now here we are being conquered and I say as we go to the
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.200]  lawyer to constitutional lawyer to get his one of the chief experts to get his
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.240]  take on this plan and I don't know his take on this yet I mean I do know what
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.960]  it's going to be because I've read his books research what he's saying but we
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:59.320]  have to get out front and not let hundreds of newspapers TV say it's
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.080]  racist to talk about seceding and that people are mad because Obama's black
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.960]  no we're mad because he's announcing cybersecurity takeover executive order
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.040]  because they're announcing we're under socialism because the country's going to
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.600]  hell in a handbasket we have to point out the blue states are all going
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.200]  bankrupt not the Republicans are much better but people at least voted for the
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.760]  lesser of two evils there they understand the road to perdition we're on we
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.320]  must go to the legislatures and I want Mr. Vieira's take on this right now we
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.960]  must go to the legislatures now and say with with versions of a new declaration
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.800]  of independence with the same facts in the original from 1776 July 4th and say
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.720]  we need to have groups organized through the governor's council not the fake
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.360]  femo one but the real governor's council the legislative councils led by
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.520]  people like dr. Vieira like Ron Paul like Lou Rockwell like count you'll
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.640]  countless other patriots out there that it's now time to say we are seceding to
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.920]  restore the republic but to also reconstitute the federal government which
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.960]  is fascistic is tyrannical is spying on us illegally and is producing a total
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.080]  tyranny of domination because they know the people are waking up it is now time
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.040]  to admit how bad it is and move at the states and explain the country's been
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.000]  conquered by globalist as Ron Paul said in the speech let's just tell it like it
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.680]  is they pride reconstitute the republic secession for survival secession to
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.960]  restore the republic secession because we've been conquered by foreign banks and
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.120]  and get that word out get different petitions circulating get different
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.880]  versions of the new declaration of independence then have a large meeting
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.720]  of governors legislators that want to come organized by Ron Paul campaign for
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.520]  liberty because he's respected and because we trust him to have that
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:57.520]  meeting and then to go forth building that idea this went on for a decade
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.000]  before 1776 we've got to do this before they come for the guns they're planning a
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.360]  civil war they're now billing it that Obama's Lincoln to the states are
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.120]  racist they've got petitions at the White House I've got it right here I'll
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.680]  show you a document cam shot of your viewer to arrest people citing the
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.880]  petitions to organize federal militias to occupy the states to implement all
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.480]  these plans folks this is going to really get bad they're now going to try to
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.400]  totally take over America they've said they're going to try to say all
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.600]  semi-autos have to be handed in now again his website I will give that to you in
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.640]  a moment Edwin Vieira Jr. holds four degrees from Harvard A.B. Harvard
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.480]  College A.M. with PhD Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and J.D.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.760]  Harvard Law School more than 30 years he's practiced law with emphasis on
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.280]  constitutional issues in the Supreme Court of the United States he
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.720]  successfully argued or briefed the case leading to the landmark decision
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.800]  booed versus Detroit Board of Education Chicago teachers I'm not going to go
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.080]  over all his landmark cases but I mean he is a chief amongst constitutional
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.160]  lawyers I've done my excited introduction sir but the crest of the wave from
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:09.360]  Julius Caesar the the play written by well the greatest playwright of all
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.720]  time William Shakespeare his version of Julius Caesar there is a tide in the
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:18.800]  affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune our fortune is a
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.680]  liberty and freedom that's the treasure we seek can you not intellectually but
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.840]  also in your gut sir feel the great wave that is now cresting and we've got a
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.960]  surf that thing into victory now is the time to go on the offense what do you
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.240]  think of my statement of redeclaration of independence a reupload of the
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.680]  original republic and kicking out and and and and trashing this new world order
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:50.640]  takeover sir well I think that's the key element this is not really a
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.920]  revolutionary activity that we're talking about it's a restoration a
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:59.120]  restoration of the principle the declaration and then a restoration of
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.440]  the constitutional principles which are founded on the principle the
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:08.040]  declaration of independence so I become a little bit leery of the ocean
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.920]  bantered around too freely because I don't think the goal ultimately is put
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:17.920]  particular states to remove themselves from the union in the sense of becoming
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.920]  independent republics independent sovereignty but to assert state
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:29.240]  authority which is really at the basis of the entire federal system so as to
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:35.680]  restore the principles of the Constitution in Washington DC to the
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:41.040]  extent that that can be done in the long term and in the short term to return as
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:49.280]  much economic and political power to the states and the people as is possible so
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.320]  I've always said this is a matter of fundamentally of what I would call
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.880]  interposition number one the states stepping forward and telling those
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.280]  people in Washington that there are certain lines that cannot be crossed
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.640]  constitutionally and if they are the states will assert the powers that they
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.320]  have under the Constitution to interpose themselves in favor of their people
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.120]  against essentially a rogue attacks that are coming out of the District of
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:17.680]  Columbia and then secondly the enactment of certain kinds of legislation
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.040]  that is completely constitutional completely within the authorities of the
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.640]  states to put into effect I would say number one is the restoration as I've
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.880]  said many times the restoration of the constitutional militia of the several
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.080]  states these are institutions that the Constitution foresees are to be permanent
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.760]  they're at the same status as the constitutionality at least of Congress
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.840]  the president the court system even the states themselves they will put in there
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.920]  for a very specific purpose because the founding fathers understood as the
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.600]  Second Amendment tells us a well-regulated militia is necessary to
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.720]  the security of a free state and this concept of a free state is the ultimate
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.960]  purpose of both the Constitution and the Declaration so that in a sense is for
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.160]  motor companies to say is job one we have to restore those institutions to
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:08.760]  their constitutional position within each of the states and when we do that
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.080]  those institutions become a foundation for taking many actions that are
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.600]  necessary to give the states the kind of political and economic I won't say
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:23.240]  autonomy necessarily but certainly clout you can't have a really independent
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.920]  state political and economic policy while the state and its people are tied
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.040]  to the federal reserve system it's impossible you have to have an
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.280]  alternative monetary system and we're going to need that any event because the
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.640]  federal reserve system is coming down one way or the other it's going to go
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.760]  into very serious crisis could be hyperinflationary could be a
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.040]  depression could be a combination of both but the end of that fiat money
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:53.080]  central banking paradigm if you will you can see it on the near horizon so
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.680]  that's step number one that could be done through a militia we need to take
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.600]  control of food security and energy security within each state that can be
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.160]  done through a state militia we need to assert all of the aspects of local
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.760]  homeland security FEMA has nothing to do with those things the Department of
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.200]  Homeland Security has nothing to do with those things once the state militia is
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.960]  organized the state militia will have control of those mouths oh and by the
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.800]  way as the Constitution points out the only officers of the state militia are
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.120]  of course appointed by the states which means that those civilian officials in
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.080]  the Department of Homeland Security FEMA whatever have precisely no authority
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.480]  under those circumstances to essentially freeze them out of this process as well
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.960]  so there's a whole series of steps that can be taken but they have to be taken
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:47.560]  within the clear constitutional paradigm that's really our problem you know
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.480]  this is a situation where we've been driving the the Mercedes down the road
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.680]  and now all of a sudden the engine starts chugging and it stops and we go out
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:19:00.640]  we lift up the hood and we look we don't know what to do why not because we
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.440]  haven't read the book of instructions which tells us go fill up the gas tank
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.960]  on a regular basis right look at the gas gauge look at the oil gauge whatever it
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.240]  is right but we have a book of instructions the founding fathers gave
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:18.520]  us for living in a free state under a limited government in which the first
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.920]  purpose is as the preamble says securing the blessings of liberty to
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:27.680]  ourselves and our prosperity dr. Evan Vieira constitutional lawyer advisor to
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.680]  Ron Paul's our guests I want you to continue sir we're gonna skip this
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.040]  network break because this is so important what I'm saying is you're a
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:40.160]  constitutional lawyer and obviously we have a right to secede we have a right
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.400]  to revolt my point is I've always been leery of secession because the system
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.440]  just demonizes it as a new civil war and they say it's been decided you can't
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.280]  secede because of what Abraham Lincoln did obviously though this isn't even a
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.800]  question of the federal government being out of control the globalists have
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.840]  taken over the federal government so I am saying the way to phrase it and I've
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.280]  seen this get through to people because it's the reality is foreign banks brag
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.240]  they've captured the federal government it's totally destroyed the federal
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.080]  system the bill of rights constitution they call us anti-federalists they're
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:15.480]  not even following the federal system this is globalism this is new world
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.640]  order so what I'm saying is with the dumb down public they can grasp secession
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.280]  that we want our own states we're disagreeing with what you're doing it
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:30.120]  will accelerate this process because the feds call states rights secession they
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.840]  call they don't think there should be a state and so if states say they should
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.400]  decide what the speed limit is you know I mean I'm in Democrats say hey let's just
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.520]  go arrest their governor so we know there's a federal globalist socialist
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.840]  tyranny now running Washington they as Ron Paul says in a speech it's it's
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:53.040]  over if we don't reverse this I'm saying it's now time to up the Annie and say
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:58.920]  okay we call secession kicking out the occupying globalist to restore the
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.320]  Republic because the feds have been captured we're gonna move at the states
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.480]  and start having that discussion of a different type of secession to restore
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:12.400]  the Republic because you have the states to see saying we're still America DC
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.400]  isn't America doctor and so we're going to do it to reupload the Bill of Rights
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.640]  Constitution via the Declaration of Independence because the federal
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.920]  government has been lost to foreign special interest that's my point is we
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:32.720]  have to clearly make the break and have the state leaders members of the of the
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.440]  federal system start meeting start having discussions start circulating a
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:42.400]  you know for many years you know a new Declaration of Independence or or or
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.760]  redress of grievances they were giving to the crown before we got to the
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.680]  codification of what Thomas Jefferson wrote there in the weeks leading up to
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:55.560]  July 4 1776 that's what I'm saying is we need to go ahead and up the Annie to get
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:00.160]  the energy going so people understand it's not just this slow movement of
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.480]  states rights which the feds just ignore and are now bankrupting the states I
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.720]  mean the feds are coming in sir as you know under new rules saying hundred
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.320]  thousand dollar fine if you wash your car in your yard six years in jail if
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.880]  your dog craps in your own yard excuse my French I mean the the the the tyranny
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.040]  was dribbling out now the cup has been turned over sir so what I'm saying is
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.960]  I'm calling to draft Ron Paul we're riding up and codifying a basic battle
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:31.760]  plan stating hey secession isn't create our other countries our country's gone
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.280]  we want the states that created the America to recreate it do you see what
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.000]  I'm saying kind of a reboot well yes and I agree with this principle because I
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  have said and I have a book coming out very shortly which goes in this in great
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.480]  detail that when you talk about the Declaration of Independence for instance
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.920]  it was not really a revolutionary document it was a document that looked
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.240]  to the restoration of the principles the laws of nature and of nature's God
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:02.880]  Magna Carta which they believed quite rightly the King George's ministerial
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.920]  government were violating and that's exactly essentially our problem today
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:11.440]  it's the same Declaration of Independence type situation you have people in the
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.280]  central governmental apparatus lawless criminals well however you want to
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.280]  describe them they are violating the fundamental laws of this country they're
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.560]  violating the principle the Declaration of Independence through globalism they're
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.800]  violating the laws of nature of nature's God left right and center and and doing
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.680]  this with impunity and we have a federal system that is built upon checks and
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.480]  balances and if we look at that imbalance which is coming out of the
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.360]  District of Columbia and ask one of the checks that are supposed to be brought
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:43.000]  into play well they are two they are the state governments number one because
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.240]  they're in the middle of this pyramidal structure and then at the base the
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.560]  thing that forms the foundation the people themselves we have been very
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.560]  lax in those two levels in the states essentially pushing back against these
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.480]  encroachments coming out of Washington and ultimately in the people not
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:03.840]  demanding of their state governments as well as the government in Washington that
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.760]  these kinds of actions be taken consistent with the Constitution so I say
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.040]  I'm really not in favor of the word succession because that tends to throw
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:17.640]  people's minds back to the historical period of the Civil War okay then what
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:22.320]  do you exactly so we need to exactly so I have a battle plan we need to come up
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.200]  with a basic plan with you and others of what to call it to start our own
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.680]  petitions just because it gets media attention on the White House website so
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:38.760]  that people see the real way so we call for a second state Continental Congress
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:44.880]  to have the states meet and say what do we do about this rogue federal government
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:51.520]  and so what do we call that sir well I call it a committee to restore the
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.800]  constitutional principles in this country and they cut that down into a sound
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:59.400]  bite but basically that's what we're doing constitutional principles and of
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.520]  course the principle of the Declaration of Independence because the real danger
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.400]  looming down the road is globalism it's the destruction of the separate
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.120]  separate and equal status among the nations exactly the Declaration of
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.040]  Independence gave us that's it well exactly exactly doctor so what I'm
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.880]  asking you as the top constitutional lawyer is we need to explain this into a
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.200]  six-year-old level to get it out there because the media is phrasing any
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:31.120]  states rights as civil war Ku Klux Klan and so and sir you know reconstruction
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.080]  whatever and that's how they want to roll this out I'm saying we just to take
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.600]  control of it we label the constitutional restoration movement as
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.320]  secession from the globalist from the occupied federal government not the
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:49.080]  secession that the Democrats told you about so we need to explain that America
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.040]  has been conquered by globalism this is a restoration but how do you put that out
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:59.400]  to people to explain because to for me that's the key is that folks the
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.320]  government's gone that's why it's so lawless they're under technocrats in
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.200]  Europe now this is bonafide I mean I mean Ron Paul's speech lays it out folks
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:13.640]  we're in it this is real and so I'm saying get the states movements people
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.000]  think it's a petition to Obama that's good to get attention with ideas that's
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  like circulating petitions before 1776 as you know but I'm saying get petitions
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.200]  going get committee hearings in the state legislatures get this buzz going
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.640]  because this is what the whole globalist architecture is set up to block
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.600]  because it's the key to restoring our republic their entire defense is set up
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.960]  against this because this is the answer well I think that's right then two things
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:48.600]  it we wanted to project the idea that we maintain our independence from this
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.360]  globalist structure I don't like the idea of saying we're succeeding from
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.200]  it because I don't think they've won yet they're close to it but they haven't won
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.600]  yet and I don't like the word succession because the other side uses that to bring
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.560]  up the concept of slavery racism and so forth and so on which I think is
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.640]  entirely red herring because it doesn't make any difference whether you're black
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:14.560]  or white liberty is the best thing for you period and the discussion right but
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.600]  they're going to play on that word constantly in order to divide and
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.840]  conquer people on a racial basis so we don't want to give them that rhetorical
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:31.520]  okay how do we seize the wave though and get the movement going I mean we need
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.880]  Ron Paul yourself Ron Ron Paul makes the call and puts together a meeting and
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.920]  invites state and federal legislators and governors people will show up it will
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.560]  be seen as a recodification a reissue into the declaration and then a battle
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.200]  plan to go to the states it must happen now Ron Paul's retiring I know he wants
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.760]  to push for internet freedom that's that's the new plan because they had a
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.400]  focus group you know ask all the campaign for Liberty people what they
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.680]  wanted that's great but that's not the battle plan we have got to draft Ron Paul
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:07.160]  now to launch this this operation and through Ron Paul to find those leaders
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:14.600]  at the state level who will take a position in the forefront that's always
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:20.760]  been my concern after you go beyond Ron Paul where are the leaders at the state
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.280]  level who are going to perform this function sir right but this is his
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.240]  greatest moment that's what I'm saying with you and with Mr. Fine and other
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.560]  constitutional lawyers who have charted from our from our births with the way
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.440]  forward we must it's our responsibility there is no doubt that Ron Paul you and
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:44.200]  others must get together this is where campaign for Liberty must go well I
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.440]  think that's right and the very fact that there is such a groundswell
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:55.800]  developing in this country yes now is the time to take advantage of that it's
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.240]  history serve this is 1776 in my heart and intellectually I mean do you not
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.840]  feel that and know that sir well it's probably about 1773 probably closer to
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.680]  it if you look at the history yes yes but I mean I'm in this way when they
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.920]  started organizing politically when they started looking forward to what they
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.880]  feared was going to happen if the king in the ministry didn't exceed to some
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.040]  reforms it took them two or three years to get that organization that that
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.000]  structure set up and then finally when the English government the British
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.360]  government refused to comply with the colonists justifiable demands then of
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.280]  course other things stay there sir walk us through this for five six more
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.640]  minutes on the other side of the mobile clips of the Ron Paul speech exactly I'm
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.640]  saying this is the beginning of 1776 as I said in the last hour this will take two
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.160]  to three years he didn't even know I said that this we're on the same page
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:53.200]  god bless you dr. Vieira we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.800]  what socialists always do once things start imploding they go just put the

[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.880]  the globalist don't care they want total domination they want to start a civil
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:08.440]  war marching the military and police off to confiscate our guns that Obama is
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.920]  certainly looking at as the NRA documented and is now admitted on
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.200]  banning all semi-autos where you got to turn them in because they don't want us
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:19.400]  to start a peaceful states rights movement and restore the Republic they
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.200]  know you're waking up they know Europe's waking up this is a banking cartel
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.680]  takeover as Ron Paul said I'm gonna play that clip in about seven eight minutes
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:33.400]  after constitutional lawyer and advisor to Ron Paul Ebon Vieira leaves us Dr.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.600]  I'm gonna try to give you the floor because I'm so excited at this
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:39.760]  historical crest repeat to me but to folks what you told me during the break
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.280]  about Ron Paul and the mantle and where we're going and that you're that you
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.600]  concur and that you're gonna talk to him and everybody else should and we're
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.720]  gonna get Bruce Fine constitutional lawyer and advisor to Ron Paul on Lou
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.440]  Rockwell I'm gonna call all his sources I'm gonna get a hold of Ron Paul and I'm
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:02.680]  gonna say now is the time to step into the leadership to organize as your final
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:07.880]  you know incredible work and you know this is such a great work that we're
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.520]  talking about here to to build the foundation going into this tyranny of
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.720]  the resistance this is yet I know Ron Paul who's accepted the draft twice will
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.960]  accept it a third time and he has thrown some of the little minions out of
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.960]  campaign for liberty that we're saying don't talk about the New World Order he
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.960]  has exposed the global government in his speech Dr. Vieira what is your battle
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:34.840]  plan what is your idea that's why we got you on to to get these ideas out to set
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:40.320]  brush fires and then to codify the plan based on our forebearers successful
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:45.520]  operation well I said to you during the break Alex the first step is for Ron
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.480]  Paul to come forward and assume the mantle of leadership here if you look at
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:56.160]  the parallel the American independence movement we had just paragons of
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:01.360]  intellectual and political virtue the Jefferson the Adams's the Patrick
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.920]  Henry's even the Alexander Hamilton but there was one man who stood out and had
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.200]  to stand out of course that was George Washington and that's exactly what we
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.480]  need at this point in time here is the man of undoubted integrity here is the
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.400]  man who has been telling us and warning us about these problems not just for
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:24.440]  years but for decades here's the man who has proven right and he needs to be the
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.880]  figure who stands in the forefront of this movement to restore the Constitution
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:35.160]  Declaration of Independence and then he needs to find really at the state level
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.560]  more than anywhere else I'm not so concerned about finding me yet in
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:45.560]  Washington DC but at the state level leaders of that caliber with the
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.880]  integrity with the political acumen with the willingness to take on this
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:55.360]  project not simply because their own political careers might be advanced
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.920]  because initially I think they won't be but because the welfare of the American
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.800]  people will be advanced and then he needs to bring in with that group a
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.440]  sizable number of advisors who have well what I would call a fair track record
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.080]  on these economic and political issues if he wants to call on me as an advisor
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.480]  I'll be perfectly willing to come forward and work with it and I think that
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:23.280]  there are probably dozens or hundreds of others like me out in the country that
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.680]  would say and do exactly the same thing but it needs his leadership he is the
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.360]  national figure here he is the one whom everyone on either side of the political
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.880]  yellow line if you will recognizes they recognize him for his personal
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.800]  integrity they recognize him for the leadership role he's taken at the
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.240]  national level and ultimately to recognize this is a man who not only has
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:56.320]  been right but has never compromised his principles which is the real key
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.560]  because what's going on in the destruction of our constitutional system is
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:07.040]  the systematic compromise and prostitution of principles for politicians in
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.800]  order to advance their personal careers and this is one man who's never done
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.040]  that the only one I could think of really at that level who has not done it
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:21.920]  yes sir so people need to get to him and urge him urge him with a capital U to
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:29.200]  step forward as the essentially his last act in the political arena to take on
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:36.360]  and begin this project I can feel history rising I can feel the spirit of
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.920]  1776 like I've never felt it listeners you you know that this is the most
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:46.160]  important broadcast we've ever done and dr. Vieira feels it I see you feel it
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.280]  you can see it and and here's what must be understood campaign for liberty are
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.800]  great people I've gotten mad at some of the folks there trying to you know play
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:58.120]  patty cake some of the young men that have become political consultants for
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.440]  the mainline Republican Party folks that have married into the polls like
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.840]  Jesse Benton you know people like Jack Hunter that are involved who you know
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.400]  go out to eat with billionaires and kind of get stars in their eyes they're not
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.880]  bad guys they're just they're just not Ron Paul Rand Paul I've known for 15 16
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:21.000]  years he used to come on and campaign for his dad we he's a good guy he's just
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.960]  up there trying to position himself you know to be able to win the presidency
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.480]  later and I get that that's not gonna happen folks in four years in eight years
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.720]  the globalists are gonna win or it's gonna be a civil war we got to be all
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:39.360]  in now folks that's why they're moving so fast I've got three children and I
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:44.120]  I've got to sit there with my wife who's extremely intelligent and she you know
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.360]  has degrees in history and she's like okay but you know we got to get out of
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.800]  here and she's lived all over the world and her dad worked for the Department of
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.240]  Agriculture and she's like we got to get out of here and I've got to say no
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.960]  we're putting it all in the line we're staying I've signed my name to the new
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:04.120]  Declaration of Independence I'm all in folks I mean I've got dirty tricks
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.840]  happening to me you wouldn't believe you just it's like a movie and I'm just
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.280]  like you know what I'm all in because folks there's no where to run this is
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.280]  history and people that are scared you don't understand you should be scared
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:21.200]  of not taking action and there are people in campaign for liberty who will
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.200]  say oh let's just work with the system let's take over the Republicans and they
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.680]  have been getting people like crews elected over the neocon you know in the
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.200]  Senate here in Texas they're getting a lot of good people in who at least on
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:36.960]  the surface are saying the right thing so campaign for liberty I've analyzed all
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:40.400]  this is Dr. Vieira is breaking down he's analyzed it campaign for liberty
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:43.280]  already knows who the good guys are in all the states it's already got all our
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:48.480]  money we gave it it's got everything it is the zenith it is the launch pad it is
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.800]  the fulcrum it is the it is the progenitor as I said in the first hour
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:59.400]  we're three years out two to three years we have to launch now history is
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:03.320]  repeating itself and the entire globalist operation is designed to stop
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.040]  a states rights restoration movement that dr. Vieira has laid out to Ron Paul
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:12.160]  and again Ron Paul gets his own ideas historically going to the same
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:17.480]  documents but he sources dr. Vieira and his battle plan dr. Fine you're both
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.360]  constitutional your lawyers PhDs this is it but I separately have gone and done
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.600]  the research and it is it is it is incredible sir thank you so much I hope
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.560]  you'll come back very soon to really lay out some battle plans I know you've
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:35.360]  already laid them out but if you'd put out articles it's it's articles that
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.600]  lay it out we're writing an article that others can add to I think we should all
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:43.560]  invade anybody can do it White House dot gov forward slash petitions and
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:49.520]  everyone should codify their own ideas of a restoration and we see the
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.440]  authoritarian lust the Democrats want to get a civil war going we need to reach
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.400]  you out to the military and police now this is a very perilous time we're in
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.360]  and they're going to call us a sessionist so I just simply say
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:09.360]  restorationist through the states reconvening a constitutional Congress
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.040]  and so we need you the constitutional lawyers and others to codify different
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.880]  plans to help Ron Paul adopt a strategy and to launch now any other points you
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:25.080]  like to make doctor America is the last bastion of human freedom in the world
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:31.080]  today this is our responsibility as Americans and my view has always been
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:36.720]  we need to take action immediately if not sooner we can't wait for Rand Paul
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.640]  for do you agree we don't have four to eight years to play patty cake with the
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:44.400]  Republicans no because the economic freight train is coming down the tracks
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.520]  at us at a very high velocity we can't avoid that and what will be the political
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:53.520]  consequences of a complete breakup of the international banking system and
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.440]  they're going to use that meltdown as a way they go they'll try to use it for
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:00.720]  their benefit and we're facing that and they're not going to be able to prevent
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.800]  it from happening but they're going to try and use it we're facing that train
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:10.800]  wreck and we have to prepare ourselves to deal with that now now now that's right
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:15.480]  that's the operative word I pledge myself doctor to you and Dr. Paul I
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.280]  pledge myself to my family before God on the altar of liberty as Thomas
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:23.320]  Jefferson said I swear eternal resistance to every form of tyranny over
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:27.160]  the mind of humankind and I know you pledge with me now on the listeners
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:31.760]  pledge we aren't gonna stop we're drafting Ron Paul we're drafting all
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.120]  liberty lovers go to your state houses now go visit the state reps go visit

[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:06.400]  tough get going it's always darkest before the dawn it had to it had to get
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:13.000]  bad before people get up that's right and now is the time and they want to
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.520]  start the civil war with the gun confiscation we've got a race now to
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.880]  to accelerate our operations against them it may be able to back them off and

[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.200]  gonna play large excerpts of this I want to play a particularly powerful part
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.200]  of the 49 minute speech that Ron Paul gave on the house floor he called it
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.760]  questions excessive government has created such a mess it prompts many
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.880]  questions he goes through those we'll go to break with that then we're gonna
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.440]  come back with his conclusion how we've been conquered by world government only
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.920]  admitting we've been conquered fraudulently you got admit your slave
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.880]  before you start becoming free and and I'm gonna tell you the greatest honor I've
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:36.400]  ever had the greatest treasure even above my children because they have no
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:41.280]  future if we don't win is that God saw fit to take a wretch like me and and
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.400]  it rise me up in all the things that happened in my life to teach to prepare
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.840]  me for this moment of what we're beginning now the bell cannot be
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:53.320]  unwrung to know with surety that we're going to win if God be with us who can
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.040]  stand against us and it's time for everyone who's in the fought and
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.280]  everything else to repent before God I even repent for nasty things I've said
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.800]  about Glenn Beck I should have responded to him more gentlemanly I
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:09.560]  apologize for when he said bad things about me being worldly we don't have
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:12.880]  time for this we don't have time to fight with each other anymore we don't
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:19.800]  have time for all this petty stuff we have got to come together all of us so
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.960]  I repent for my trespasses do you repent for yours all of my enemies out
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:29.000]  there please come in for the big win please realize how much trouble we're
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:36.600]  in realize how much danger in these globalist are dangerous we have to get
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:40.840]  involved now we have to get aggressive now we have to go out and wake up
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:44.240]  everybody we can now and then we come back on the next segment his
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:49.720]  conclusion you know we've put with this show eugenics back on the map we've put
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.240]  the fact that we're conquered on the map with that nomenclature the truth the
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:59.240]  truth will set us free admit how far we fall and admit how pathetic we've gotten
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:04.960]  only then can we rise again and Ron Paul is now getting more hardcore because
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:10.200]  that's all he can do now that Ron Paul is leaving Congress now that his sons in
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.520]  the Senate all this Ron Paul it's time to come out both barrels I know you're a
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:22.280]  man after my own heart I know you know what I know say it all lay it out throw
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:29.280]  yourself against the new world order and all of us will as well and let all the
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.160]  rest of campaign for liberty establishment types that have infiltrated
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.280]  let them hit the streets they're already getting their big Republican jobs I know
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:42.960]  you've purged them good good because there is no future now all in here's
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.520]  part of Ron Paul speech we're going to break and finish up with the rest of it
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:49.000]  here he is saying some questions and he lists the incredible tyranny we're under
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.120]  and I have some other points here it is have a few questions excessive government
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:48:00.040]  has created such a mess it prompts many questions why are sick people who are who
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:05.720]  use medical marijuana put in prison why does the federal government restrict the
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:12.640]  drinking of raw milk why can't American manufacturers manufacturers rope and
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:17.320]  other products from hemp why are Americans not allowed to use gold and
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:23.200]  silver as legal tender as mandated by the Constitution why is Germany concerned
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.560]  enough to consider repatriating their gold held by the Fed for her in New
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:34.520]  York is it that the trust in the US in dollar supremacy beginning to wane why
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.280]  do our political leaders believe it's necessary to thoroughly audit why do our
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.960]  political leaders believe it's unnecessary to thoroughly audit our own
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:49.680]  gold why can't Americans decide which type of light bulbs they can buy why is
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:56.280]  it the TSA permitted to abuse the rights of any American traveling by air why
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.720]  should there be mandatory sentences even up to life for crimes without victims as
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.720]  our drug laws require why have we allowed the federal government to regulate
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:12.120]  commodes in our homes why is it political suicide for anyone to criticize
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.160]  a pack why haven't we given up on the drug war since it's an obvious failure
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:23.240]  and violates the people's rights has nobody noticed that the authorities can't
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.880]  even keep drugs out of the prisons I can making our entire society a prison
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:34.160]  solve the problem why do we sacrifice so much getting this and getting
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.960]  necessarily involved in border disputes and civil strife around the world and
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.240]  ignore the root cause of the most dangerous deadly border in the world the
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:49.960]  one between Mexico and the United States why does Congress willingly give up its
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:56.000]  prerogatives to the executive branch why is changing the party and power never
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.640]  change policy could it be that the views of both parties are essentially the
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.320]  same why did the big banks the large corporations and foreign banks and
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:10.560]  foreign central banks get bailed out in 2008 and the middle class lost their
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:16.280]  jobs and their homes why do so many in the government and the federal
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:22.000]  officials believe that creating money out of thin air creates wealth why do so
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.480]  many accept the deeply flawed principle that government bureaucrats and
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:30.920]  politicians can protect us from ourselves without totally destroying the
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:35.080]  principle of liberty why can't people understand that we're gonna come back and
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.200]  finish up the wide part of this and we're gonna get to the most powerful the
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:42.520]  whole thing though he says we have a cancerous group of psychopaths that's a
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.600]  quote running things I mean he lays it all out world government we're conquered
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:52.680]  it is unbelievable 49 minutes and we're just gonna cover it and cover it and
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:59.240]  cover it Ron Paul is standing up I mean it's time to go 110% into the eye of the
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:04.720]  enemy many conservatives believe the 2012 election was a disaster and hope
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.400]  2016 will turn out much better but even before he was reelected one of the
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:13.080]  country's most widely circulated newspapers discussed how our commander in
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:17.800]  chief could seek a third term and one Maryland based analyst says it's a lot
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:22.240]  more likely than most Americans think in fact he spent the past six months
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.320]  uncovering the details of a shocking event set to take place during Obama's
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:31.000]  second term which could essentially enable Obama to extend his presidency for
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.160]  a third term this would ultimately make him one of the most powerful presidents

[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:00.160]  war going on against us an undeclared secret war with the chemicals and
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.280]  biologicals in our food and water we're far gone we need to get back in their
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:11.280]  face all you people that serve the system your victims as well you fools we've
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.320]  got a breakaway civilization of technocrats that think they're gonna
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.920]  be able to take everything over man we're in trouble wanted large banks large
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.920]  corporations and foreign banks and foreign central banks get bailed out in
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:26.880]  2008 and the middle class lost their jobs in their homes let's continue with
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:31.640]  this out the rest of this segment and coming up after loot Rockwell and others
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:35.000]  I'm gonna I'm gonna play about five minutes where he has his summation and
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.240]  boy he breaks down that we're under global government unelected global
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:43.640]  government run by eugenicists let's go ahead and go back to his questions here
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:48.800]  it is without totally destroying the principle of liberty why can't people
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:54.040]  understand that war always destroys wealth and liberty why is there no so
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:58.800]  little concern for the executive order that gives the president authority to
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:03.720]  establish a kill list including American citizens of those targeted for
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:09.480]  assassination why is patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.880]  the politicians who run it rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:20.120]  support for the people real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:25.800]  government when it's wrong why is it claimed that if people won't or can't
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.000]  take care of their own needs that people in government are able to do it for
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.280]  them why did we ever give the government a safe haven for initiating
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:42.120]  violence against the people why do so many members defend free markets but
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.880]  not civil liberties why do so many members defend civil liberties but not
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:53.200]  free markets aren't they the same why don't more defend both economic liberty
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.800]  and personal liberty why are there not more individuals who seek to intellectually
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:02.480]  influence others to bring about positive changes those who seek power
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:09.840]  changes than those who seek power to force others to obey their commands why
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.480]  does the use of religion to support a social gospel and preemptive wars both
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.320]  of which require authoritarians to use violence or the threat of violence go
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:24.600]  unchallenged aggression and forced redistribution of wealth has nothing to
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:30.240]  do with the teachings of the world's great religions why do we allow the
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.880]  government and the Federal Reserve to disseminate false information dealing
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:39.040]  with both economic and foreign policy why is democracy held in such high
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:46.440]  esteem when it's the enemy when it's the enemy of the minority and makes all
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:52.320]  rights relative to the dictates of the majority why should anyone be surprised
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.000]  that Congress has no credibility since there's such a disconnect between what
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.720]  politicians say and what they do is there any explanation for all the
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:06.560]  deception the unhappiness the fear of the future the loss of confidence in our
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.880]  leaders yes trust in the anger there is a frustration because we're under
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:16.360]  yes there is and there's a way we're gonna break attitudes we come back we
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:21.120]  are going to have Lou Rockwell on no actually we have Porter Stansbury on
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:24.520]  the break now what's happening in the economy then Lou Rockwell but I will

[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:06.000]  he predicted that going to QE3 they're now starting it he predicted so much of
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.600]  what was going to happen in the last decade and he is now predicting right
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.520]  now well that well that's in the mainstream news that they're going to try
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:16.960]  to push for a third term for Obama in the mass depression they're going to
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:20.960]  engineer and so we're going to be looking at that a lot more and where he

[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:36.960]  websites for for different projects what is the best website for people to go
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.080]  to where you have the proof and the you know the information that they're
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:47.320]  trying to move in this direction it's the third term the number one dot com so
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:55.840]  third term one dot com well we've got that site up on screen for prison
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:00.480]  planet TV viewers will continue to give it out I want to go to the economy with

[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.720]  what's happening dealing with the economy well in the from the economy
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.520]  standpoint I've got some numbers for you on these supposed efforts to cut the
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:17.600]  spending and things like that I'll show you there's no way they're going to be
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:22.320]  able to do it and in regards to Obama's third term I'd really like people to see
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.040]  that there's a connection between something that's going on in the oil
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:35.000]  business and presidential politics continuing as well you'll QE unlimited
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.800]  has begun and they are talking about all these major currencies going down will
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.760]  people even notice if the big event accelerates I think people are definitely
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.920]  going to notice the fact that their purchasing power is being eliminated by
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:55.680]  the ongoing inflation that the governor refuses to recognize the website folks if
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:02.200]  you want to see the breakdown the video presentation is www.3rd term one
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:09.120]  dot com that's the number three just the numeral three just three rd term one
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:17.680]  third term one dot com is the best way for people people to find that URL and
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:20.880]  I do think we should discuss this because if we don't discuss the fact that
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.480]  Democratic operatives are in newspapers that you point out your presentation up
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:27.920]  on the side if we don't point out that they're pushing this and that they're
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.320]  trying to float the idea like it was Schwarzenegger to change the 22nd
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.200]  amendment so he can run for president they're going to end up doing it I mean
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:37.960]  he just signed an executive order today and made it secret what his new
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.840]  cybersecurity takeover is but we know what the bill was even CBS News said
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:48.040]  it's a takeover the internet Chinese style control yeah well you know if you
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.200]  if you just look and see what he what he's been doing to win these elections
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:59.400]  by ramping up the enormous amounts of spending that the government's giving
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:05.360]  directly to individuals 750 billion dollars now on welfare programs to go
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.760]  directly to individuals food stamp rolls that have increased by 50% in his
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.880]  presidency if you take just those people who get food stamps that's like 75% of
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.960]  people that voted for him so he you know he the Democratic Party are
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:23.400]  engineering these election victories and I don't think it's unreasonable to
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:27.800]  believe that he could find a way to engineer the repeal 22nd amendment but
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:32.000]  even if he doesn't do that Alex that doesn't necessarily mean that he won't
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.560]  have a third term he could have a proxy and that's one of the things I talk
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:40.560]  about he could put up Eric Holder for example to be the next president while
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:44.480]  he actually remains in control of the administration much like Putin has done

[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:35.880]  I love what went the average democratic party operative is and there are
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:41.080]  minions and people I mean it really is shameful to watch as now a million
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:45.600]  300,000 and counting people have signed petitions all 50 states are about to
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.600]  qualify last time I checked it's like 20 states have now qualified to have to
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.760]  get a White House response because of the number of petitions to secede but
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:57.080]  people don't really know you don't go to the White House.gov to secede you go
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.080]  to your legislature I'm not calling for the classical succession the federal
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:05.560]  government's been taken over and so I'm saying have the states get together and
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:10.600]  organize and say hold your horses you're out of control we want to restore the
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:14.200]  republic I mean the foreign banks brag they've conquered this country just like
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.600]  they brag they've conquered European nations and Porter Stansbury predicted
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:22.520]  all of this Lou Rockwell is coming up but they are now threatening people and
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:25.920]  he's got an article posted Lou Rockwell.com saying don't do this or you're
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.680]  gonna regret it and they've got their operatives in conservative media saying
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.200]  don't sign those petitions it's your right to say we want to secede from this
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:37.440]  federal thing whether it's unsophisticated or not it's people voicing
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.120]  their concern. So Lou Rockwell is coming up more around Paul's speech where he
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:46.040]  says world government's taken us over. Porter Stansbury founded Stansbury and
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:49.000]  Associates Investment Research to Private Publishing Company based in Baltimore

[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.360]  short and it just continues together. Porter and his research team to exhaust
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.040]  the amounts of real world independent research they visited more than 200
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:18.040]  companies in order to find the best low risk investments in the world and they've
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:24.120]  got a new special website with a video presentation www.3rdterm1.com
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:29.680]  that's third term one the numbers are just you know single numbers not not
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:35.680]  spelled out 3rd term one 3rd term one and I got to say yeah they are floating
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.800]  articles everywhere saying in the news right now hey Obama should run for a
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:45.280]  third term we're gonna do this the latest on the economy QE3 what he sees
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.840]  are happening but first I got to ask you Porter what do you make of them saying
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:53.320]  you didn't build it we're gonna bankrupt America we're gonna confiscate all
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.240]  semi-automatic rifles and handguns and Democrats are really saying hey let's
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.200]  start arresting people and you're racist if you don't like world government I
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:06.840]  mean I mean this is even nastier than I thought it would be this is crazy I mean
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:10.760]  why do you think they're trying to totally take over right now I think you
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:14.280]  know I think they believe that they have the votes that they have the power of
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.200]  people behind them and I think if you look at what's going on in our country
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.920]  they've the you know this idea of class warfare has really materialized where you
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:28.640]  have a half of the people that vote that voted for Obama receiving enormous
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:34.880]  direct federal handouts you know they the Democratic Party has perfected this
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:40.880]  this machine that buys elections and they're gonna see how far they can take
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:44.520]  that because it doesn't look like the Republicans can can get organized
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:49.880]  enough to stop them well that's because they're part of the same global system
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:55.080]  where do you think the power structure is trying to take us Porter well just
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.080]  look at you know just sort of look what look what's going around the country your
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.480]  you have you have the highest amount of dependence on the government and the
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:07.760]  history of the United States at the same time you have the federal government
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:11.880]  beginning to break apart financially let me let me throw this number out at you
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:16.280]  Alex and you tell me where it leads right now the government is spending the
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:22.880]  federal government is spending $55,000 per household in the United States there
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:29.560]  114 million households okay they're spending $55,000 per household on
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:34.160]  government United States right now the the average income per household is only
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.280]  $50,000 in the United States does that make any sense is there any country in
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:43.680]  the world that can spend more on government than it earns an income it
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:49.240]  leads towards designed implosion and the weekly standard said it's 61,000
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.720]  breaking down congressional numbers but let's just say 55,000 the average
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:58.760]  welfare household is getting and they are bringing us into debt servitude they
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:03.720]  are deindustrializing the country under Agenda 21 we are being conquered just
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:12.400]  like Stalin conquered Ukraine by turning off the economy well I just look at the
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:19.440]  numbers side of things and I can't find any plausible reason that either party
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:24.560]  would run the country this way they're doing generations of Americans to
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:31.760]  poverty independence and they're doing it by you know by bribing these ignorant
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.360]  voters who will believe anything they read and will do whatever they have to
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:40.240]  do to get a free buck that's worse than that more and more Democrats and then
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:44.000]  they talk about it on all the shows Bill Maher talks about it they say they're
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.840]  gonna just arrest us and put us in forced labor camps I'm not joking that's in
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.400]  the new army manuals I mean they're gonna come literally put us on plantations
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.840]  Porter and let let big fat government slobs beat our brains out rape our
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:59.040]  wives I mean that's really there and I'm not kidding that's what they want to do
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:04.080]  well they're not gonna do that to me Alex I'm I'm prepared to believe if
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:06.920]  things turn out like that no no no but I'm listening I want listeners to know
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:12.200]  I'm not joking they are licking their lips misery loves company they just want
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:15.720]  to wreck and and just decimate everything I mean this is what happens in
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:19.400]  every other country and look at how decadent we are Ron Paul talked about
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:23.400]  it as farewell speech he said we are incredibly immoral and evil we are run
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:29.200]  by authoritarian psychopaths I mean I mean let me tell you we cannot underestimate
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:33.760]  Porter how bad it's gonna get I agree with you completely on the economic side
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:38.160]  of things and I thought that we're on Paul's farewell speech was the most
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:43.680]  poignant political speech I have seen in our country since George Washington's
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:50.000]  farewell address it should be mandatory for every American to watch and
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.560]  listen and to think about he's the only political leader in the United States
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:58.440]  who is willing to tell Americans the truth about our government which is one
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:04.280]  that were financially bankrupt and two that were morally bankrupt America is
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:10.320]  dead basically dr. Paul but but we're not physical we can be resurrected but
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.720]  we're dead it's over we're far gone by design we've been conquered and now
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.440]  we're about to be deindustrialized Porter break down what you think Obama's
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:22.800]  planning from his own operative statements during the implosion he'll be
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:28.800]  the FDR that saves us break that down and stay in office well you know Alex I
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:33.320]  think the one thing that's going on in our country right now that could delay
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:38.960]  the fiscal implosion is the renaissance in the oil and gas industry in
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:44.240]  America it's very powerful it's very real and it's gonna produce a lot more
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:49.800]  revenue and a lot more power for politicians and that is gonna with the
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.520]  way I see things if you look at people who ran for president for three terms
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.960]  it's Teddy Roosevelt Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Obama and they all had
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:00.920]  certain things in common they are all populist they all spent a lot of money
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:05.760]  on the people and they are of course all very progressive but the other thing
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:11.120]  they had in common was in 1901 there was an oil boom from spindle top and 1930
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:15.920]  there is an oil boom from east Texas and right now going on in America is the
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:21.520]  biggest renaissance in oil since 1930 it's the shale boom and all this oil is
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:26.840]  producing a huge new revenues for the feds and also enormous power for Obama
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:34.360]  because right now it's against the law to export oil and so he has the ability
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.760]  to grant licenses that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:42.800]  corporations and of course he's gonna use that power and all that leverage to
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:46.640]  propel himself into a third term and yesterday the Commerce Department
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:49.880]  announced that the United States is now the number one producer in the world
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:56.240]  surpassing Saudi Arabia yeah most Americans don't realize what's happened
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:59.720]  over the last three or four years in the oil fields there's been a huge
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:04.760]  renaissance in oil everywhere I drive in Texas they're drilling yeah and listen
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:10.920]  Alex that's undeniably bullish for our economy and it could absolutely
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:15.520]  sustain our currency for another five or ten years this is gonna this is gonna
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:19.960]  really impact our trade deficits and assuming that we begin to export this
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:24.800]  excess energy it could really help the balance of trade for our country but in
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:29.120]  the process it's gonna make an icon out of Obama because he's gonna take all
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:33.320]  this money like Chavez did and he's gonna buy more votes tomorrow which is
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:37.240]  exactly what Teddy Roosevelt did that's exactly what FDR did well that's what
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:40.800]  Lindsey Williams was saying is that after they imploded the economy they would
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:45.600]  bring in all this new oil and that that would buoy things better than the rest
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:49.400]  of the world but they'll still be in overall global depression or are you
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:52.680]  saying things will turn around or you're saying they'll use this as the
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:57.800]  process of socialization I'm saying that this will this is going to prevent an
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:03.240]  economic collapse for a certain amount of time but instead of investing this
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:08.200]  money wisely to set our country back on sound footing they're going to use it to
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:11.760]  buy more power and more influence and in the process of course they're gonna
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:16.680]  squander this incredible natural resource that we have and and then that's
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:22.080]  gonna put us even further in the hole no matter how much resource you have it
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.680]  doesn't matter I mean Venezuela is still a poor country and they have more oil and
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:30.280]  gas resources than any other place in the world right so why why why can't
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:34.880]  they get their stuff together and the answer is because politically they're
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.840]  they're using this resource for exactly all the wrong thing no no ten years ago
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:42.200]  they had power on everywhere now the power is out half the time folks you
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:47.560]  can see the full break none of this in an amazing video presentation at 3rd term

[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:28.000]  Obama did it it's so sick yeah well you know that he's gonna take credit for all
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.440]  the stuff even though of course he's been against it the whole time but it
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:35.760]  doesn't matter because there is so much money to be made in this I mean Alex you
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:39.960]  can't imagine how how valuable the stuff is just think of this for one second
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:46.160]  the price of WTI oil that's the price of oil in the United States is about $85 a
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:51.200]  barrel the price of oil anywhere else in the world is about $125 a barrel that's
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.000]  an enormous spread okay and it only costs you a couple dollars a barrel to
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.400]  ship it anywhere you want it and it gives you control to drive up or down the
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.320]  market wow so what stay there stay there stay there
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:06.640]  Sermotus believe the 2012 election was a disaster and hope 2016 will turn out much
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.680]  better but even before he was reelected one of the country's most widely
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:14.520]  circulated newspapers discussed how our commander-in-chief could seek a third
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:19.040]  term and one Maryland based analyst says it's a lot more likely than most
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:23.840]  Americans think in fact he spent the past six months uncovering the details of a
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:27.760]  shocking event set to take place during Obama's second term which could
[02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:32.600]  essentially enable Obama to extend his presidency for a third term this would
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:36.400]  ultimately make him one of the most powerful presidents in US history a
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.640]  rival to FDR this analyst believes it will change the course of our nation's

[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:47.840]  been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything in its power

[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:23.120]  coming up or on balls historical speech we've got to get excited we got to take
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:26.360]  the states back we got to have the states get together and say we're
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.640]  nullifying you you want to call that's a session whatever you succeeded you were
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.800]  taken over by the globalist that's coffin nails to these people we're gonna
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:38.320]  draft Ron Paul to get that message out because he gave that message out in his
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:44.920]  speech and that's coming up Porter you're right Putin you've got the folks
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:50.680]  that in Argentina using oil to stay in power you've got Venezuela with Chavez
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:55.640]  and there is an oil boom we're now numero uno number one oil producer in
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:00.040]  the world and it's something that cartels can control and that Obama can
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.080]  manipulate please continue and how that ties in what will he do in that third
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:09.840]  term I mean we're talking about dictator Obama pretty much here what I think
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:13.520]  it's clear if you look around the world there's a link between oil and
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:18.240]  dictatorship and the reason is of course is that oil delivers incredible
[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:23.520]  amounts of wealth and whoever controls that wealth has all the power so if you
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:26.760]  look at the cursors in Argentina there was a husband and then there was a wife
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.480]  and they've they've kept control the government for a decade now could
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:36.160]  Michelle Obama run and four years I don't see why not but I personally think
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.600]  it's gonna be a stooge it's gonna be an Eric Holder type guy and that's assuming
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.600]  that he can't just flat out by his way out of the 22nd amendment which I think
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.280]  he'll be able to and let me give you some facts that you should you can focus on
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:53.480]  okay this is the things you should watch for right now there are a dozen us
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:26:00.800]  companies 12 us companies that have filed for a licensed to export LNG which
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.880]  is liquefied natural gas and Alex I know you're aware that there is a there
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:10.120]  is a huge glut of natural gas the United States the prices of natural gas have
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:13.360]  fallen so low that the companies are flaring the stuff off rather than
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:15.480]  bothering to put it through the pipeline they're just keeping it in the
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.000]  ground they got it turned down boy am I aware of that yeah okay so there's
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  nothing wrong with the cell in the stuff overseas because we're drowning in it
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.120]  okay but they can't Obama has sat on these licenses for over a year he will
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:33.720]  not give anyone a license to export the LNG why well very simply no one's paid
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:36.520]  him enough money yet they all wanted to see whether he would win this election
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:40.400]  now that he's won the election he's gonna collect think about what happened
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:43.840]  when he gave up his senate seat in Illinois remember the governor there
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:48.600]  blogovic yes remember what he said over the FBI wiretap he said this thing is
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:53.720]  effing valuable I'm gonna get something for it right yes well they'll believe me
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:59.640]  these licenses are worth a lot more than a stupid senate seat these things are
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:04.400]  worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars because the price of natural gas
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:10.000]  in Japan is $16 and MCF it's also like to cut Russia off cut Russia off from
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.560]  Europe Russia's playing blackmail with their natural gas they're gonna have
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:20.480]  those super tankers ship that stuff to Europe this stuff is this energy we have
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.640]  is the most valuable thing in the world's economy it's valuable politically
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:29.400]  it's valuable in terms of the macro politics of the globe and most
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:33.840]  importantly it's powerful politically it gives him enormous amounts of
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:37.920]  power in the country so if he says hey I'll give you a license as long as you
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.400]  back my third term what's he gonna get he's gonna get the third term while we
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:48.240]  get the third term so he's gonna buy off the poor with with welfare he's gonna
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:54.680]  buy off the corporations with energy is there any way to stop this nightmare
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:59.040]  because I mean he says he's gonna try to ban semi-auto guns that will start a
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.480]  civil war and then I guess all the corporations will line up behind him to
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:05.960]  just take over America as long as they can make some money I don't think there's
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.640]  any way to stop this as long as you have the system in place we have where so
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:16.040]  few people support so many others I mean look we're a 10% of the people in
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:21.160]  United States are paying for 75% of Obama's largest half the people in the
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:26.560]  country are dependent upon the federal government you know 50 million people are
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:32.840]  getting food stamps you can in a democracy this is just completely
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:37.600]  destructive because you've bought all the voters and hey you know that in the
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:44.680]  last election only 51% of the eligible Americans even bothered to vote I know
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:48.560]  listen Porter I gotta have you back up soon for a full hour because you talk
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:51.880]  about the zombies it is getting frightening when people you told them
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:55.680]  about all the tyranny these yuppies and people giggle and laugh they're so
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:58.920]  disconnected from reality they've never had their butt kicked they've never been
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:01.880]  in the military they've never been mugged they've never gone hungry they've
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:05.800]  never worked a day in their life and they think it's all funny I have no idea
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:10.600]  what these idiots are gonna think when it all collapses well you know they're
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:14.600]  not gonna do very well I can guarantee you that I've thought for a long time
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:18.640]  what would happen if the if the food stamps checks wouldn't clear you know if
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:21.560]  there was so much inflation that the food stamps wouldn't buy you food anymore
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:25.200]  what would happen to an urban setting like Baltimore or what would happen in
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:29.520]  Houston and I think those people who were ignoring these fiscal problems and
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:32.400]  who are ignoring what's happened to the morality of our country are going to be
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:36.240]  it for a rude awakening one day absolutely the Ron Paul speech parts of
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:39.080]  it's coming up is just off the charts we're gonna be playing it all over the

[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:39.240]  these states most people won't even be ready won't be able to get out of town
[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:43.920]  because there'll be absolute panic. There is no preparedness without strategy

[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:39.800]  about a three four minute clip before we get blue Rockwell on to talk about the
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:42.840]  secession movement and the threats that are flying from the feds and their
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:46.200]  cohorts who want to have a military conflict with the American people the
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:49.640]  socialists on their sides are it's time to arrest them it's time to go in with
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:52.880]  the militias we'll take everything they've gotten redistributed and these
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:56.000]  are all like these little spindly-necked wimps who couldn't fight their way out of
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.720]  a paper bag you dirty little commies go ahead and try to start a fight and see
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:03.240]  what happens to you you make me want to throw up how you work for the foreign
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:07.920]  banks and you know for you know every three shillings the new order gets you
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:10.840]  get one I mean it's disgusting how you've sold everything out in your
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:15.000]  socialism and your fake moral high ground the rest of it it's just
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.320]  unbelievable at parasites you are but I want to play Ron Paul here in his
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:25.920]  summation from his speech because he talks about world government and how
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:29.600]  we're under world government now commanding our military and then we'll
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:34.680]  go to blue Rockwell of blue Rockwell dot com here is Ron Paul's conclusion to
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:41.400]  the 48 49 minute powerhouse speech that's up at info wars dot com and
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:47.520]  prison planet dot com here it is in conclusion what are the greatest dangers
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:54.000]  that the American people face today that impede a goal of a free society there
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:58.720]  are five the continuous attack on our civil liberties which threatened the
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:05.840]  rule of law and our ability to resist the onrush of tyranny number two violent
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:11.640]  anti-Americanism that has engulfed the world because the phenomenon of blowback
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.200]  is not understood or denied our foreign policy is destined to keep us
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:21.320]  involved in many wars that we have no business being in national bankruptcy
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:27.560]  and a greater threat to our national security will result number three the
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:31.400]  ease in which we go to war without a declaration by Congress but accepting
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:36.960]  international authority from the UN or NATO even from for preemptive wars
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:42.560]  otherwise known as aggression a financial political crisis as a constant
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:47.160]  number four a financial political crisis as a consequence of excessive debt
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:51.600]  unfunded liabilities spending bailouts and gross discrepancy and wealth
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.760]  distribution going from the middle class to the rich the danger of central
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:03.880]  economic planning by the Federal Reserve must be understood world government
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.080]  taking over local and US sovereignty by getting involved in the issues of war
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:14.480]  welfare trade banking a world currency taxes property ownership and private
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:20.080]  ownership of guns must be addressed happily there's an answer for these
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:24.040]  very dangerous trends what a wonderful world it would be if everyone except the
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.440]  simple moral premise of rejecting all acts of aggression the retort to such a
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:33.960]  suggestion is always too simplistic too idealistic impractical naive utopian
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:39.520]  dangerous and unrealistic to strive for such an ideal the answer to that is
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:42.640]  that for thousands of years the acceptance of government force to rule
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.320]  over the people at the sacrifice of liberty was considered moral and the
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.520]  only available option for achieving peace and prosperity what could be more
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:54.800]  utopian than that now considering the results especially looking at the state
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:59.200]  sponsored killing by nearly every government during the 20th century
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.960]  estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of people it's time to reconsider
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.560]  this grant of authority to the state no good has ever come from granting
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:12.800]  monopoly power to the state to use aggression we are going to air all of
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:18.800]  this on the Sunday radio show over two hours I'm gonna be there playing five
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:23.560]  minute clips commenting it is the greatest political speech that I've ever
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:28.200]  seen because it's not political it's about reality Ron Paul is calling for a
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:32.960]  return of reality and sanity and I've never been more proud to know Ron Paul
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:37.200]  I've never been more proud to know he's right and historically the
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:41.480]  collectivism despite all its promises is a nightmare and how he indicted the
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:46.280]  mega banks taking us over the world government the the the the preparations
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:51.640]  for mass arrest he laid it out and said folks we have psychopathic
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:55.760]  authoritarians these are quotes I mean this is the speech that I would like to
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:59.120]  write because I'm always wanting to do a whole film just breaking down the
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:04.720]  continuum of it and he's done it and and and I have announced that's why today I
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:07.800]  had an epiphany last night I knew the states right movement was what the
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:11.240]  globalists were preparing for because they know it's the constitutional remedy
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:17.160]  they're spinning secession like it's the civil war and racist and saying there's
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:20.560]  gonna be violence and that Obama needs to write in like Lincoln and arrest
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.920]  people this is petitions at the White House now I mean I've got them right
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.680]  here where they say arrest us all this this isn't even when I call secession
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.960]  it's the state saying the federal government sold out to foreign
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:34.160]  corporate interests the globalist world government now commanding our military
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:38.640]  NATO they brag in the newspaper we've been conquered by foreign banks we've
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:41.920]  got to have Ron Paul go out with that message with campaign for liberty that
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:47.600]  knows where all the patriots are at have competing ideas for a reissuance of the
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:51.960]  original Declaration of Independence with a battle plan to say you're a
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:55.440]  legitimate Federal Reserve you've hijacked the country you've now got
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:00.960]  governing power under the Dodd-Frank bill I mean we're in trouble and and we
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:06.040]  repudiate this and what it is is it's a it's a it's a platform to challenge them
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:09.760]  and then people see legitimacy in government so through the states even
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.000]  though you know they're more legitimate in the feds they're still a problem we
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:19.160]  can literally beat these people it's the best platform it needs to be led by
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:23.880]  Ron Paul as I said the first hour Lou Rockwell Evan Vieira Bruce Fine and
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:29.480]  other constitutional lawyers and men of true integrity okay and any there's
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:32.360]  some women out there that have fought tyranny with integrity I'm not even
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.400]  saying I'm in this rodeo but I'm I've rung the bell and I know this is the
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.880]  battle plan and this is the way to go we have to offensively because there's a
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:46.160]  hunger now it's 1.3 million signatures all 50 states are about to qualify for a
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:49.960]  White House response sure you don't go to the government the feds and say give
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:53.840]  up your power but it but but it's it's attacking the articles on the door it's
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.040]  it's letting them know it's a Declaration of Independence by the people
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:02.560]  that we're not going to be slaves under socialism for the blue states all sucking
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:05.660]  their thumbs and we don't want the Republican governors either telling us
[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:09.880]  go along who are squealing we but again they're gonna spin this we're going to
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:13.840]  Lou Rockwell there I don't know what his take is gonna be on this but I think
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:16.880]  it'll be with me because it's constitutional it's historical it's
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.160]  it's a reissuance of the Declaration of Independence it's a reupload of that
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:24.760]  but the feds have been seized by globalist it's totally special interest
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:29.000]  as Ron Paul said we have to start with states that have enough moral people and
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.560]  enough producers left to stand up and say I'm not a slave it's the new civil
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:36.880]  rights movement it's the real civil rights movement we are going to have
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:41.480]  the state stand up with petitions at the legislature legislatures voting to say
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:45.920]  full annulment we do not recognize you anymore we are America we are the
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:50.280]  Republic so not even succession it's pulling out of the occupied federal
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:55.040]  government to reestablish the Republic now now again we have to get our own
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:59.160]  petitions not that they matter at the federal level except in the image the
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:02.600]  whole world to stage each of us players upon it it's a real stage of life and
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:06.480]  death but it's how you present it and so we need Lou Rockwell to come up with
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:11.040]  ideas Ron Paul Ron Paul must put on the mantle as constitutional lawyer
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:15.680]  Vieira said who advises Paul he totally agree with my plan we must launch it now
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:20.760]  the flood has come we must surf this thing or it's over they're gonna start a
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:25.100]  civil war okay they're coming for you the authoritarians know times running out
[02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:30.080]  Lou I got you on and I'm ranting here I'm so excited because a few times in my
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:34.520]  life things have crystallized and I know when I'm right I know when I've done
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:38.440]  the historical research and I know when the zeitgeist is there and I have never
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:43.560]  this is ten times the electricity I've ever felt Lou Rockwell what do you say
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:47.040]  to what I've just laid out here all I'm laying out is what our country was
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:51.480]  founded on can we rediscover the Republic can it rise again will you help
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:56.640]  us get Ron Paul to lead this exploratory movement to really get aggressive
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.600]  well certainly Alex Ron Paul is the leader as we saw in this you know
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:04.920]  fantastic farewell to Congress speech at one of the great speeches of all of
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:09.280]  American history he is the leader he's gonna continue to be the leader I would
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:12.320]  say he's gonna be a more effective leader now that he's out of electoral
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:16.760]  politics he's got many wonderful things in store for us plans that he can't
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.600]  disclose quite yet but after the first of the year when he's no longer in
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:25.600]  Congress is just wait for there's gonna be great stuff ahead but this this
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:29.300]  principle of you know it's I hate to quote Woodrow Wilson he referred to it
[02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:34.840]  as self-determination principle of secession Livio von Mises famously said
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:38.680]  more than a hundred years ago that no people are part of a people shall be
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:43.720]  held in a political allegiance or alliance to which it's opposed it's
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:47.240]  it's wrong this is in fact an ancient Catholic principle goes back to the
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:51.360]  Middle Ages of decentralization that with certain things should be handled
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:55.280]  the level of the individual others at the level of the family others at the
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:01.280]  level of the local community and you do not have the higher governments in
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:06.560]  society controlling the lower you have it just just the reverse so this this
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:13.400]  policy of decentralization of secession is absolutely a key principle of human
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:17.000]  liberty Jefferson talked about it he talked about the worst thing that could
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.080]  happen to this country is we'd get a consolidated government a centralized
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:24.920]  government but it's it's one of the bad things about government many bad things
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:28.600]  about government one of the bad things about government is they all get
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:34.280]  together to increase centralization Hans Hoppe has pointed out why this is in
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:37.640]  their interest so that you have whether it's what's happening in the EU
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.520]  individual countries conglomerating together to make a to make a unified
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:45.320]  state in Europe or at least that's what they want it's already happened in this
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:49.520]  country we've had state and local authority needless as the individual
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:54.040]  authority and other sorts of private authority wiped out or crushed by the
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:56.920]  federal government as it become more and more of a centralized state and these
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:00.240]  people of course all want a world government they want you know they want
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:05.440]  to know a North American Union they want they want they want a world
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:09.240]  government just the sort of horror that John Maynard Keynes used to campaign for
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:15.160]  and every other terrible person political person maybe in the history of the
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.200]  human race I'm sure the Pharaoh wanted to be head of the world too so all the all
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.960]  these guys want this but on the on the other side of power glory for the state
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:32.040]  conglomeration centralization stepping on other people killing mass killing mass
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:35.760]  spying all of the wonderful things the government does to us and to and to
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.720]  people in other countries there is that you know the opposing moral force what
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:46.440]  we call it secession decentralization and and I would argue as Hans Hoppe and
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:49.440]  others have pointed out this really should get down to the individual level
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.880]  we should be able to succeed as individuals Alex like you I never agree
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:59.360]  I never signed the US Constitution this of course was a point that that was
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:03.240]  under spooner made in the middle of the 19th century we didn't we didn't agree
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:07.480]  to this this is something that's imposed on us so the government imposes its
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:10.960]  view on us whether they call it the Constitution or and of course as Ron
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:15.080]  Paul pointed out in his speech the Constitution has failed the Constitution
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:19.480]  did not work so we need we need to concentrate more on what's wrong with
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:23.040]  the government we can't count on the government to save us we can't use these
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:26.680]  government documents thinking that they're going to they're going to save
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:30.280]  us from the government the government uses them against us now I would agree
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:33.480]  with you that the declaration of independence which is a declaration of
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:40.400]  secession is maybe a something we can very much count on rhetorically and to
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:46.720]  it and its principles but you know we always have to remember to and Ron Paul
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:51.160]  has pointed this out just recently America we think of the current American
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:55.960]  system was founded by the secession of the 13 colonies which were 13 little
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:00.400]  independent countries and too bad that we don't still have that system but
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.000]  anyway the 13 independent colonies seceded from Britain this is a war of
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.800]  secession it was not a war of conquest the typical war we think of the kinds of
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:13.120]  wars the US wages so was a war of conquest the war that the Americans
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:17.240]  wage was to get out from under Britain they didn't want to invade London and
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:21.440]  try to rule Scotland or or Wales or whatever they just wanted nothing to do
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:25.920]  it with England in terms of political control so you know that's the way many
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:32.040]  of us feel about Washington DC we feel it about for that matter our own state
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:35.840]  capitals maybe even our local towns they well they're all becoming tyrannical
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.080]  government at all levels is becoming more tyrannical by the day maybe that'll
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:44.000]  help us understand the government is not the answer the other hand Jefferson
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.200]  pointed out that competitive sovereignty is could help restrain government and
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:52.120]  of course it was the abolition of the states as competitive sovereignty is to
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:57.520]  the federal government and the abolition of entities within the states also
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:03.880]  help the sexualization process Jefferson Jefferson said that that people who had
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.360]  his sorts of political views stood with the states against the general
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:14.800]  government stood with the towns against the states stood with the wards against
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:20.920]  the towns stood with the individual against everything so that's the way to
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:25.280]  think of it we want more decentralization more power downwards we
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:28.200]  don't want centralization we don't let alone of course we don't want world
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:32.240]  government or anything like it we don't want a huge conglomerated nation state
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:37.480]  like the US which is too big to be free yes sir one hundred thirty million
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:40.880]  people under one gigantic government and think you're going to have freedom you
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:43.600]  don't have freedom you have tyranny which of course is what we've got
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  absolutely we're rockwells our guest I'm sure you know because you were we
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:50.600]  actually have an article off the rockwell dot com blend back as told his
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:55.040]  listeners and I want to get into bashing thing with him it may just be pure you
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:59.360]  know fear fashion well well I mean my point is he's saying don't you dare sign
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:03.200]  that you'll be a traitor I have his quote in the video here and then we get
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:07.160]  emails I know you're getting them we've got an example right here anti-succession
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:11.640]  threat where it's like I strongly suggest you do not send petition or align
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:15.560]  yourself with any group that would place your allegiance to the country in
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:19.240]  question how about our country got taken over by globalist who bragged that
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:23.840]  they've conquered America on CNBC and the Associated Press banking cartels
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:27.960]  that literally take my money and give it to them while they debase the rest of
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:31.920]  the money and then they're saying it's racist the new civil wars about to
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:35.240]  begin Obama will be the new Lincoln they've been getting ready for this
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.160]  forever I mean these people are truly sick they have petition signed to arrest
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:45.080]  us and to have federal militias come in and retake the states with volunteer
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:49.160]  Democrats who want to run around in little Soviet uniforms they're dreaming
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:53.960]  of some Soviet I mean these people are sick Alex I can remember when Glenn Beck
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:58.200]  said that romp Paul supporters were potential terrorists should all be
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:02.400]  investigated by the army and potentially in the arrested by the army
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:07.160]  yeah no he called me a piece of garbage two days ago what is the what is the
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:11.120]  concept of treason I mean that actually would argue that the government owns us
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:15.400]  that we you know even though they do nothing for us they of course do plenty
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:19.400]  to us that they own us and we're not allowed to get out from under them and
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:23.280]  of course this is you know this is they the government in the American past has
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:27.760]  killed people for wanting to get out from under it so we can't we you know we
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:32.000]  always have to be aware that that they are violence incorporated on the other
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:36.320]  hand we don't need violence we have the ideas the right ideas on our side the
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:41.160]  idea is a freedom as rockers in the nation who is Barack Obama or Mitt
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:46.800]  Romney or Mitt Romney's assistant Glenn Beck to tell the average American
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:50.640]  family that the feds in Washington should be running them as should be
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.480]  supervising them as to how they raise their children should be supervised in
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:58.160]  their home supervising their neighborhood supervising their business I
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:03.680]  mean that's just because pure tyranny and again we need a much smaller country
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:07.640]  would be a great thing to break up the US just like it be a great thing to break
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:13.840]  up the European Union if we look back to the wonderful example of Germany on top
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:18.840]  of points out in free a treaty of West failure days there were 700 little
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.280]  countries that made up Germany they all were Germans they were culturally and
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:27.120]  linguistically Germans but they had they had a tiny government created
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:32.400]  competition between those and firewalls to tyranny no this is this is the way
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:36.400]  it's supposed to be this was the way it was in the Middle Ages when it when you
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:40.160]  just have tiny tiny countries so we've had this terrible tendency by
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:45.160]  politicians to try to conglomerate together the better to rip us off the
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:49.000]  better to rule us the better to put their boot on our neck that's what they
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:52.200]  live for they love and of course the better to wage wars the better to take
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:56.040]  all our money through taxation better to control every aspect of our life rock

[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:17.080]  again we have a global corporate banking cartel that's gotten our government
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:20.800]  to sign on to all of its fraud they've got a giant horde of people who don't
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:24.440]  even know how to tie their shoelaces who are totally domesticated calling for
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:29.880]  anybody who works his head in total class warfare envy we've seen this
[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:34.040]  happen hundreds of times the last thousand years or so we are in deep
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:38.440]  trouble this country has cancer all I say is we can debate smaller units later
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:42.240]  the states are what could deliver that of the Constitution we got to kick the
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:46.040]  globalist out of Washington and then reconstitute the Republic if that's what
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:51.520]  the states chose all I know is I want the foreign occupying force out and Lou I
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:54.880]  don't want to just move around trying people elected to Congress I think it's
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:58.040]  now time to go to the states and say hey you want to secede or you want to
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:01.520]  develop a plan to have a new Declaration of Independence to kick the
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:04.800]  globalist out because the globalists I know you've seen this in the news they're
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.360]  bragging they've conquered our country and I think that's pretty important that
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:14.040]  all these big mega banks and you'll see NBC and the Associated Press tell us
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:17.640]  we're now run by foreign banks but that's a good thing they know best yes
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:22.160]  global governments here but the ADL says you're a terrorist if you say there's a
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:26.520]  world government you know it's time to just go all the way here what's your
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.600]  take on that well I think it is you know I think our ideas are winning this is
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:36.120]  what what bothers the opposition and I think it's wonderful that if a state
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:41.680]  wants to for example seek to use gold and silver as money internally or all
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:45.560]  those other kinds of things get rid of federal regulations nullify federal
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:51.960]  regulations I remember the great moment when South Carolina to oppose that the
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.080]  rotten tariffs of Andrew Jackson that this had nothing to do with slavery by
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:01.360]  the way despite the propaganda they said if you try to raise taxes to the extent
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:05.400]  you're going to destroy us you try to do that we're not going to go along and if
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:09.240]  any federal officials come into our state to try to enforce this taxation
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:13.040]  we're going to arrest them so that was that was the the first great
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:17.840]  nullification and as Jefferson Tom Woods is a great book on nullification if
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:21.360]  you're interested in this topic everybody take a look at Tom's book and the
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:25.800]  power to taxes the power to destroy we are being destroyed we are being
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:31.520]  physically attacked financially by these people here's what I'm saying I know the
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.240]  energies there if Ron Paul steps up and says he's going to lead a movement I
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:38.080]  know they're going to for internet freedom because they put out a
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:41.000]  questionnaire to campaign for liberty people I've looked at it and I said
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.320]  internet was important so he's going with what his constituents of liberty
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:47.720]  have pushed for but I think it's important to codify and go look this
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:51.080]  this this nullification is going to happen campaign for liberty's got to get
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:55.160]  out front Lou Rockwell's got to get out front you've been out front but say hey
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:57:00.760]  you know this isn't what you say secession is this is reconstituting the
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.880]  Republic kicking the globalist cow kicking the fellow reserve out I think
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:08.880]  we can route these people I'm telling you there's a real revolutionary fervor
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:13.280]  there Lou and I think it's time to launch well Alex we've got the truth on
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:16.640]  our side and the truth is that we all have the right to be free we're all
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:21.600]  born free until governments of course try to make us unfree this again as you've
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:25.560]  pointed out this is a very ancient battle between freedom and and and the
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:31.200]  state so secession is part of it self-determination we have the right
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:35.480]  to that they don't have the right to control us against our will and we have
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:38.840]  the right ideas on our side and we have to remember you know even though the
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.040]  government is a is a is aggression concentrated aggression the freedom

[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.520]  now we've got to strike while the irons hot Alex this is the attitude we all
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:41.240]  have to have first of all this is how we start we're walking on the street and
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:44.760]  some guy comes up and shoves a gun in your ribbon and gives us give me your
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:47.840]  wallet maybe you're gonna give him your wallet but you're not gonna give him your
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:52.160]  consent you're gonna realize you were robbed that's the government so you don't
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:55.320]  say oh thank you sir for protecting the public good in the common defense and
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:59.400]  everything by taking my money too many Americans have that attitude to the
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:04.280]  government the government is our enemy it's a parasite it's not doing us any
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:07.720]  good it's doing us immense harm it's doing immense harm to the whole world
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:12.680]  the US government the biggest richest most powerful government ever to exist so
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:16.960]  first of all we have to have you know the attitude that that God created us
[03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:21.240]  free and the government is in effect serving Satan by taking away our freedom
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:25.720]  yes so we have you know that that's that's the nature of the struggle again
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:28.760]  you have to know something about economics you have to know something
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:32.120]  about American history you have to know something about political philosophy and
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:36.760]  libertarianism and so forth to arm yourself intellectually help arm other
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:41.140]  people intellectually this has to be an intellectual fight because they've got
[03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:45.480]  most of the guns they've got the tanks they've got the atomic bombs we can't
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:52.960]  fight them that way they use our energy and our smarts to build it well yeah
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:57.520]  that's right but we are the majority the people who are the ripped off are the
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:03.520]  far more of us than the rippers off so we can't fight them first refuse to give
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:09.920]  them a consent educate yourself talk to your neighbors stir up trouble in in an
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:13.840]  intellectual sense by telling people the truth of the situation pay no
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:18.360]  attention to you know the networks or the big newspapers they're all of course
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:23.520]  just liars and they're all involved in a large called them state-run media it's
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:27.000]  time to just come out with it course of course the now is talk of the house use
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:31.240]  that phrase when talking about foreign media but of course these ABC and NBC and
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:35.640]  CBS New York Times Washington post LA times it's so great to see all these
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:39.200]  people going down of course but they are the state-run media they're in bed with
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:43.920]  the CIA as the church hearings showed the way back in the middle of the 1970s
[03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:48.840]  the forgotten church hearings the AP all in New York Times Washington post all
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:53.560]  these organs are in bed with the CIA and are engaged in propagandizing and lying
[03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:58.560]  to us so just ignore them learn from people on the internet like you Alex pay
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:03.200]  no attention to the official media except maybe to laugh at them or maybe use it
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:07.880]  as a stimulus to get to get angry at them declare them the enemy just I like
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:11.560]  shouting at the TV set myself when I'm watching these things exactly the news
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:17.280]  so you know but just don't don't be fooled and learn some economics the
[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:22.280]  government is wrecking the country it's wrecking our society the big banks of
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:25.680]  course are doing very well in the other the military industrial complex the
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:29.440]  people who are ripping us off but most of us are being harmed by the government
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:33.520]  are being harmed by this agency that tells us that they're superior to us
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:38.240]  that they can use their laws to hurt us but their laws don't apply to them
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:42.160]  absolutely and causing you know what they're not above the law the moral law
[03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:45.600]  applies to them just as much as it does to us just because you're in a government
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:50.000]  suit like mr. betray us with all those Boy Scout medals on his chest doesn't
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.880]  mean that he's better than you are fact you can know he's worse than you are
