[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to midnight as well.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  A couple weeks ago I covered the article, the shocking article, out of Harper's Magazine and another interview that was done of the author, My Guerrilla News Network.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  The good folks over there, he's Jeffrey Charlotte.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  Now, I've talked a lot about neo-cons, neo-conservatives.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  They're for open borders, gun control, supercomputers of Communist China, nuclear reactors in North Korea.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  They're for draconian police state legislation like Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  They have bizarre Nazi connections like the Bushes and Prescott Bush running the largest Nazi bank in the United States, Brown Brother Harriman, that controlled over half of Nazi steel production.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  The Skull and Bones with all of its bizarre activities at Yale, with all these CIA directors and three Bushes.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  I've infiltrated Bohemian Grove and videotaped the bizarre rituals that our world leaders do there, German Chancellors, British Prime Ministers, American Presidents.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  And yeah, it all sounds crazy, but it's mainstream, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  The Grove admitted on Trio Network in that hour-long special that aired, Secret Rulers of the World, that indeed I did sneak in and get footage of that ritual, but they're just having fun.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  I guess they were just having fun in the movie Eyes Wide Shut.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  But you have all these so-called Christian leaders involved with these organizations calling themselves Christians, but doing the exact opposite.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  We were just talking to Jeffrey Charlotte, and he was getting into how they think that Hitler's model was good, Mao's model was good, the mafia's model was good.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  They don't call themselves Christians.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  They don't call themselves Christians.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  No, it's all about Jesus, and Jesus wants a secret world government with a secret brotherhood running it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  They call it the brotherhood, the family, all these different names, very shadowy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  They've got a house in D.C., where we're on the radio right now, where seven to eight Congressmen live, Ash Cross connected to it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  A lot of good Christian leaders are connected to it.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  Go over this in detail for us, Jeffrey Charlotte, please, because it's so important.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  I would also challenge folks to go to your website, killingthebuddha.com, about your upcoming book.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  Please break it down for us what the brotherhood is, or the family, as they call it, how they operate, how it was founded, and all these shadowy connections.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  Okay.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  The family started in 1935 in Washington State, and it started as a union-busting group, small-scale, Norwegian immigrant named Abraham Brady, whose biggest fear was communism.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  He was a minister, but his main thing, he thought that God was calling him to fight communism and was giving him a special commission.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  And everyone else, he thought Christianity had always ministered to the down and out, the poor and the weak.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  And he said, well, what about the up and out, the powerful and strong?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  And he thought that's what Christ wanted him to do, was to go out and minister.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  And so he built that up, starting there and then spreading across the country.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  By the early 40s, a third of the Senate had attended one of his weekly meetings in Washington, and these would be prayer meetings.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  And ostensibly there would be no politics discussed, but it's all about giving you a particular worldview that's going to help you make your decisions.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  And it's also about making deals.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  And as they spread out internationally, these prayer groups would encompass more and more international leaders.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  And they had a particular affinity for dictators, strongmen.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  General Kosti Silva, the horrible dictator in Brazil.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  General Suharto, who was a murderous dictator, killed half a million of his own citizens in Indonesia.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  These were guys that they would get into prayer cells with U.S. congressmen.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  And as the group has grown, it's never gotten too big, because they're not looking to convert everyone.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  And that's what makes them different than your standard Christian fundamentalists.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  I want to mention their view of Christ as essentially this sort of very strong leader who should dictate every decision we make, not just moral questions.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  Now, you also say that they say Christ is more of a spirit guide, and that, of course, Christ's emissaries here on earth,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  this secret global order will administer his kingdom here in this part of this larger global system.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  Now, it's obvious from your writings and then what I've dug up since I read your stories about this,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  and you were inside the group, of course, for a month and then investigated it for months before and after,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  that it's just an envelope, an envelope, a way for them to use Christians as a cover.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  From the evidence I see, they've done this in countless other organizations to put this, oh, this Christian mantle on covert activities
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  and legitimize dictators and mass murderers.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  I mean, you get into how they sit around at these dinner tables and talk about how Hitler was good.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  Well, I can clarify that. They do admire what they call a Hitler model.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  That does not mean that they admire Hitler's policies, although they're unclear that there's not much of a distinction.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  They are not anti-Semitic, but they do say, look, here's what this guy, he worked with a group of five of other brothers, friends, and look what he accomplished.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  Imagine if we could put that model to work for Christ.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  But also, you say, Jeffrey Charlotte, writer for Harper's Magazine.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  You also say in there, in an interview you did for Guerrilla News Network, that Nietzsche, they talk a lot about Nietzsche.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  Well, Nietzsche was insane. He said God was dead. He hated Christians.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  I mean, you've got all these unsundry characters. This is all they seem to talk about.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]  Well, I depicted seeing which one very intelligent young guy and I had a discussion about Nietzsche.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  And I should say, look, I think Nietzsche's a philosopher. We should all study whether or not we agree with him.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  I don't think that's out of line. I don't think that's crazy.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  I think what's crazy is not making the distinction between the Hitler method, so-called, or the Mao method.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  You know, there was another one. Imagine if you could take what Mao did and put that to work for Christ.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  Well, you can't, because that's not a Christian goal. And I think they don't make that distinction.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  I have nothing against Christianity. I'm not an anti-Christian writer by any means.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  I want to see them. And I think there are actually a lot of people with good heart and good integrity within the group.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  And they are not paying close enough attention to what they, as a group, are doing.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  But, I mean, that's how the Masons work, is you've got the low-level useful idiots that mean well that are being used by the higher-level people.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  And I'm just telling you, sir, from my study, the people that are involved, this fits the model that I have seen over and over again.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  And these so-called Christian leaders, a lot of them are members of this group.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  And they put the spin out that basically you're not going to heaven unless you worship George Bush.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  And he's this ordained, great Christian man, this great leader.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  All the guys are members of Skull and Bones of Bohemian Grove.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  And I've been on talk shows with these so-called big Christian leaders.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  And they will rebuke me on air for criticizing Bush about Skull and Bones.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  Yeah, yeah. Well, I tell you, it gets even more complicated than that.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  You can find this online. Al Gore once referred to Doug Coe, who is the leader of the family, this group, as one of his personal heroes.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  So they cut across political lines. What they're most interested in is power.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  It's not even so much a particular agenda.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  I mean, they like George Bush and John Ashcroft, as you mentioned.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  They've been involved with them since 1981, when he began corresponding with the leader and meeting with him.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  But they also have democratic allies, too.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  And they've even, you know, if you look at some of these leaders that they've allied themselves around the world,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  despite their fierce anti-communism, they'll even ally themselves occasionally with a communist leader.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  Well, I mean, that's the double-speak of we're against communism, but we fund it, we're for it,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  because it centralizes things, and Jesus wants centralization.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  Now, Jesus Christ fought against centralized government of man.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  He stood up against Rome. He stood up against the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  This is a joke. And they talk about Christ being the spirit guide.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  They say that they're not really against abortion, that other religions can do a good job.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  That's what your article says. Is that accurate?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  Yeah, they do. They definitely maintain, in as much as they have a public space, which is not very much,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  they're dedicated to being, in their own words, an invisible organization.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  And that's not me charging them with that. That's what they call themselves.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  But in as much as they sometimes surface in the public, they have a fairly ecumenical approach.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  So, for instance, you know, Duharto was an Indonesian. He was a Muslim, you know.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  And they're happy to work with him.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  Or I just discovered some correspondence with Ziad Bahr, the former dictator of Somalia,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  who was meeting with Charles Grassley, still a senator today, a Republican senator.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  And Ziad Bahr was a Muslim, of course.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  But he would say, yeah, sure, I'll pray to Jesus, because he knows that's giving him an entree into American government.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  Now, what is the Cedars? You talk about how they bring world leaders in,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  and how you even saw a congressman meeting with them, who was basically being interrogated to be a member.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  He was there presenting himself. Let's talk about that, who the core is, the core group, it's all secret.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  And then some of the members of this, and some of the so-called Christian leaders today.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  Sure, sure. Well, there's a bunch of locations. Ivanwald is the house for young men, at which I live.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  And that's down in a sort of a cul-de-sac, where a bunch of houses all belong to this.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  The chief one of which is called the Cedars, this beautiful old mansion,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  built by the son of the George Mason, famous from American history.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  And they use that to host diplomatic events.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  I was there, for instance, one day. Ed Meese, former attorney general, very corrupt guy,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  was presiding over a diplomatic breakfast with an ambassador from Rwanda,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  and one of the biggest wars on the planet right now is involved in.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  And then they also have a house in Washington, D.C. proper, where these congressmen live.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  And that's where I saw a Republican congressman, Todd Teahart of Kansas, meeting with Doug Coe.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  And Congressman Teahart was very eager to prove his credentials
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  by showing how fiercely opposed he was to abortion and to Islam.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  And that was kind of a no-no. They got upset about that.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Doug Coe, the leader, said, that's not what we're really about.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  We're just about building what he calls a covenant, this bond, this bond.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  What about just saying we're Christian and taking over Christian organizations
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  and having key personnel and positions of power?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, in the documents, they refer to the long-term goal as a worldwide network
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  of 200 world leaders committed to thinking like Christ, talking like Christ, and acting like Christ.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  And of course, you've got to remember, their idea of how Christ acts and thinks and talks
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  is not necessarily the same as that of most Christians.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  In your article, you say that they're all having a discussion around the dinner table,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  and they say, who had a covenant? And they say, Hitler. Oh, yes, very good.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  We will have our own covenant Jesus with Mao and Hitler. I mean, this is insane.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  Well, they would not say we have a covenant with Mao and Hitler.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  They say, like Mao and Hitler, who had a covenant.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  They see that these guys, the guys who've been most effective are these fascists.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  Yeah, and the Nazis, of course, were the fool's society.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  Illuminati, this is MSNBC, that founded the Russell Trust, 1832 at Yale, and it's the same group, folks.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  Stay there. This is riveting, Jeffrey Charlotte. We really appreciate you joining us.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  And I want you to continue telling us the story and breaking it down.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  There's so much more, and then I want to take some calls.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  His website is killingthebuddha.com. He also writes for Harper's.
[00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:13.259]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:18.259]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:26.259]  The big money of the so-called neo-con-Christians. They attack those that expose Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones.
[00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:35.259]  And I was talking to Jeffrey Charlotte, the writer for Harper's Magazine, who spent a month inside the organization in D.C.
[00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:40.259]  I was talking about Bohemian Grove during the last segment. During the break I was talking to him and learned something.
[00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:49.259]  And I told you, folks, it was a connection to this because I've done my study under the different names, the Brotherhood, the Family, all these different names.
[00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:57.259]  That the founder or the prime mover of this organization in modern times does a lot of his recruiting at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:00.259]  But why don't you tell us about that, Jeffrey?
[00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:05.259]  That's just something I learned about recently. A man named Doug Coe, the leader of this group of families.
[00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:13.259]  Not the founder, but he is essentially the prime mover. And he has attended the Bohemian Grove, apparently.
[00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:17.259]  And that's how he works. He goes around the world. He's visited every country in the world.
[00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:25.259]  And he does what he calls making friends. Oftentimes he'll travel with a couple U.S. Congressmen abroad. That's very effective.
[00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:30.259]  And I'm sure the Bohemian Grove is very effective, too. This is one of the best connected guys on the planet.
[00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:35.259]  And this is not me accusing him of this. Again, this is people within his own group talking about it.
[00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:40.259]  I've seen his correspondence with, you name the political figure. He knows him and talks to him.
[00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:46.259]  And he goes and he says, hey, look, why don't you just come in and pray with my friends and I.
[00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:54.259]  And it'll be totally non-political and we'll just exchange views. And you bring a person closer and closer into this covenant, this tight relationship.
[00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:59.259]  Now, this is just the level they allowed you into, the documents they allowed you to see.
[00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:04.259]  You were saying there was a lot of documents that you were not allowed to see, a quote, about the core.
[00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:11.259]  Well, there are a lot of, one of the things, again, and I say that these guys are not as well organized as one might fear.
[00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:16.259]  Because the fact of the matter is they put a lot of their documents in public places.
[00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:20.259]  I think they don't think they're doing anything wrong. So they're not really afraid.
[00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:24.259]  Well, sir, the practice is now to hide everything in plain view.
[00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:29.259]  That could be it. That could be it. But whatever the case may be, the documents are there and you can read them.
[00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:34.259]  And, you know, when I say that anyone doesn't believe what I'm saying, go ahead, look at the documents.
[00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:42.259]  Now, you were saying this congressman from Kansas is there and he's saying, hey, I'm pro-life, I'm a real Christian, I want your support.
[00:14:42.259 --> 00:14:46.259]  They've got all these big Christian leaders and other senators and congressmen and women as members.
[00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:51.259]  And they say, hey, don't bring up this abortion thing. We're not really concerned with that.
[00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:56.259]  We're not really after the Muslims. You know, Jesus is everything.
[00:14:56.259 --> 00:15:02.259]  I mean, it's so obvious what's going on. Now, who are some of the big Christian leaders that are supported and involved?
[00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.259]  You mentioned Billy Graham.
[00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:11.259]  Billy Graham, yeah, Billy Graham has been referred to in the documents as a core member for going back many years.
[00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:23.259]  Chuck Colson, who is now a big Christian leader, was at one point Nixon's cheap, dirty tricks guy actually went to jail for that for, I think, three years and came out and found something called prison fellowship.
[00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:26.259]  But he's a Christian now. We can't criticize him.
[00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:36.259]  He's a Christian. He's an interesting Christian. I mean, I actually came across a letter from Chuck Colson to Doug Coe saying, hey, our German brothers are really doing a great job.
[00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:41.259]  They're essentially saying something effective. They've got the Nazi technique.
[00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:46.259]  Now, again, I want to emphasize Chuck Colson is not a Nazi. He's not an anti-Semite.
[00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:51.259]  What these guys admire, though, is the organizing principles, and they don't make the distinction that the organizing principle is false.
[00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:55.259]  Well, this is what they admit to you. This is what they admit to you on the surface.
[00:15:55.259 --> 00:16:00.259]  I believe that. I believe that. I've researched them pretty deeply, and I don't think that makes them any less dangerous or worrisome.
[00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.259]  Sir, do you know who founded Skull and Bones?
[00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:05.259]  No, just that I've heard of Skull and Bones.
[00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:15.259]  Well, go read the MSNBC article. It was founded by a secret German cult in the United States for the purpose of taking over the United States.
[00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:24.259]  It is a fool's society. Their symbol is the swastika. This is admitted. It's inside the tomb. Hitler was a member of the same brotherhood, okay?
[00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:26.259]  Just want you to know that.
[00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:31.259]  I will check it out when we get off the phone today. I will check it out and do some research.
[00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:39.259]  I think this group probably then might even stay clear of that, because the fact of the matter is they're not committed to Nazi principles.
[00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:45.259]  What I'm saying is that they're recruiting at the Grove. They've got Skull and Bones people in the higher echelons.
[00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:51.259]  Well, Skull and Bones aren't in any powerful group in the country. It's an association of powerful men.
[00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:56.259]  You can say, oh, we're just having fun, but powerful men hanging out together and helping each other.
[00:16:56.259 --> 00:17:00.259]  But then they threatened you. Two of them said, well, you better watch it. You're a traitor.
[00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:05.259]  Yeah, yeah. I talked to a bunch of them, and they were quite decent.
[00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:08.259]  They said, look, I'm really upset that you did this. This is really wrong.
[00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:12.259]  It's called good cop, bad cop. I will start doing what you did.
[00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:21.259]  I believe the good cop. I would say to the bad cop just what they would say to me. I'm praying for them.
[00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:25.259]  I hope that they want to follow Christ, and I hope they learn to do that.
[00:17:25.259 --> 00:17:29.259]  That involves not threatening people to say things you don't like.
[00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:33.259]  Well, Lionel Chetwin threatened me. You know who he is?
[00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:34.259]  No, I'm not familiar with him.
[00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:42.259]  A big guy making this major TV movie about Bush being a hero on 9-1-1 and a top guy taking over the media for Bush.
[00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:48.259]  And I'm there in the dressing room in Los Angeles, and the guy walks over and says, you're Alex Jones.
[00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:52.259]  We're going to get you. They're real Christians.
[00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:57.259]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[00:17:57.259 --> 00:18:01.259]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:19.259]  All right. We've already got a lot of callers that want to talk to our guest, Jeffrey Charlotte.
[00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:22.259]  We'll go to your calls here in a few minutes. I know he's got more he'd like to add.
[00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:31.259]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:36.259]  Before we go back to my guest, whose website is KillingtheBuddha.com, an upcoming book he's got coming out.
[00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:46.259]  He's a Harper's writer. Before we talk about the brotherhood, the family, this prime moving CIA-connected organization of so-called neocon Christians.
[00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:52.259]  You want to find out what these guys are really up to, what goes on at the Bohemian Grove where they recruit.
[00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:58.259]  Where German chancellors and British prime ministers and members of the Dutch and British royal family go.
[00:18:58.259 --> 00:19:04.259]  And the Bushes back into the 30s and presidents at the turn of the last century.
[00:19:04.259 --> 00:19:11.259]  It goes on and on. If you want to know the truth about Bohemian Grove, and they admit I snuck in and got this footage.
[00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:16.259]  That's mainstream news. You want to see the rituals they do, worshipping Moloch.
[00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:20.259]  Last time I checked that's not a god Christians are supposed to worship.
[00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:25.259]  You want to see the mock human sacrifice, the video I got that was aired on Trio Network.
[00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:31.259]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:40.259]  And the film starts with Washington Times, AP, Reuters, articles about the Grove, admitting the orgies, admitting the satanic rituals.
[00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:45.259]  But it's all just fun. You know the Christian leaders go and they truck in the male prostitutes.
[00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:50.259]  But oh they're just having fun. So you need to go to Infowars.com.
[00:19:50.259 --> 00:20:00.259]  You need to get this video. You need to call toll free to get it at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:06.259]  You also need to get Police State 3 total enslavement about government sponsored terror, Patriot Act 1 and 2,
[00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:12.259]  Homeland Security, the FEMA camps, all mainstream news, executive orders, gun grabbing.
[00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:14.259]  It's all in Police State 3 total enslavement.
[00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:18.259]  Then I have frankly my best film, 9-1-1 the Road to Tyranny and part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror,
[00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:23.259]  covering what really happened on September 11th and how the globalists carried that out.
[00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:34.259]  So go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get the videos or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:44.259]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:20:44.259 --> 00:20:51.259]  Please take action. Get my videos. Make copies for non-profit, educational, not for sale purposes.
[00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:55.259]  Get them. Make 100 copies. Force multiply the information.
[00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:59.259]  Give it to your church so they know who these neocon leaders really are.
[00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:06.259]  Now back to our guest, Jeffrey Charlotte again with Harper's Magazine, incredible articles.
[00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:10.259]  A lot of them are very tame though, just analysis of different religious groups.
[00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:14.259]  This one is one of the more bizarre about the brotherhood of the family.
[00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:19.259]  You say that some Christian organizations believe this is an anti-Christ organization.
[00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:21.259]  Can you tell us about that, sir?
[00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:24.259]  Yeah, sure. I think they're even crazier.
[00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:33.259]  There is a group online that has been tracking this guy, Doug Coe, for some years on the theory that he is the anti-Christ.
[00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:41.259]  And if you believe in that particular kind of literalist and unsophisticated reading of Revelation,
[00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:44.259]  yeah, then I suppose he could fit your profile.
[00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:48.259]  I do. I think he's the anti-Christ. No. But there are these groups that are out there.
[00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:55.259]  Well, regardless, saying that the Hitler and Stalin are mal-model, I mean, that's sick enough.
[00:21:55.259 --> 00:22:01.259]  That's sick enough. That's my point exactly. We don't need to even go any further than that.
[00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:06.259]  As soon as you say, hey, let's use the Hitler model for Christ, well, you've gone off the tracks right there.
[00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:12.259]  Well, look at Homeland Security. That was called Reich Security. Reich meaning land, land security.
[00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:15.259]  And the police are wearing black uniforms. I mean, it's really happening.
[00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:18.259]  Let me read you a quote here, and then I'll let you continue. We'll take calls.
[00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:25.259]  Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration,
[00:22:25.259 --> 00:22:28.259]  but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose.
[00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:34.259]  The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.
[00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:41.259]  David Rockefeller's statement in 1973 about Mao Zedong in the New York Times, August 10, 1973.
[00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:50.259]  So the neocons followed this Professor Strauss, Chicago University, someone who fled Germany.
[00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:54.259]  He wrote papers, Reuters has reported, saying that dictatorship is good.
[00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:58.259]  So we have this same theme popping up over and over again.
[00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:05.259]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. I think that's it, and I think that's a common thread throughout is a certain number of people
[00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:13.259]  who really feel that a few elite men should be calling all the shots, and that's the government model they admire.
[00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:17.259]  And they don't even quite recognize sometimes that what they're advocating is dictatorship.
[00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:21.259]  Now, what are the exact, I mean, you've got the quotes in the Harper's article,
[00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:24.259]  which it had to be documented on the record or Harper's wouldn't let you run by it.
[00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:27.259]  Oh, yeah, yeah. The lawyers combed over it.
[00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:31.259]  But continuing with this, exactly, now you're sitting around with these people,
[00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:35.259]  and they talk about how, I'm trying to find the quotes here,
[00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:42.259]  Jesus needs a sacred group of men running the world so he can love us properly. Is this what...
[00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:50.259]  Well, I can tell you, for instance, there's a document that they gave me for one of their projects called Youth Corps.
[00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:54.259]  Youth Corps is sort of a, it's a group that's going to go around
[00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:59.259]  and build these sort of these island walls like homes for young men and young women to train them.
[00:23:59.259 --> 00:24:02.259]  And in their official documents, Youth Corps doesn't even admit to being a Christian group,
[00:24:02.259 --> 00:24:05.259]  much less a fundamentalist group.
[00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:09.259]  But then they have these other documents, a document called Youth Corps Vision, which I was given.
[00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:13.259]  And it says the vision is to mobilize thousands of young people worldwide,
[00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:18.259]  committed to principle, precepts, and persons of Jesus Christ. That's fine.
[00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:24.259]  And then it says to help them mature into people who talk like Jesus, act like Jesus, think like Jesus.
[00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:26.259]  That's the power of faith.
[00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:31.259]  And then when it gets weird is when they start saying to see that the finest and best invisible organization
[00:24:31.259 --> 00:24:34.259]  is developed and maintained at all levels of the work.
[00:24:34.259 --> 00:24:39.259]  And even though the structure is hidden, see that the family atmosphere is maintained
[00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:41.259]  so that all people can feel a part of the family.
[00:24:41.259 --> 00:24:44.259]  And that's why I say you go off the rails right there.
[00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:48.259]  Invisible organizations are not what Jesus was working toward.
[00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:51.259]  Invisible organizations are not what's more important because we're a democracy.
[00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:54.259]  We are not a Christian nation. We're a democracy.
[00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:56.259]  We're a constitutional republic.
[00:24:56.259 --> 00:25:00.259]  Let me stop you for a second, Jeffrey Charlotte.
[00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:02.259]  Number one, we're a constitutional republic.
[00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:03.259]  Okay.
[00:25:03.259 --> 00:25:05.259]  I'll get a lot of heat over that.
[00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:07.259]  No, you're right, you're right, you're right. Thank you for the correction.
[00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:13.259]  You know in a pure democracy if 51% of the people say kill this group and take their property, it happens.
[00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:17.259]  In a republic you can't. The minority as well as the majority is protected.
[00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:18.259]  But let me continue.
[00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:23.259]  There is a classic intelligence system, pyramidal structure,
[00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:29.259]  where you have the low level idiots who pay their dues, their tithes, fund the higher level echelon,
[00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:31.259]  and they have key people in positions of power.
[00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:35.259]  This is how the CFR, how the Trilateral Commission, how others work.
[00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:39.259]  And then you see the CFR and Trilateral and Bilderberg Group
[00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:43.259]  and Bohemian Grove members all in this organization.
[00:25:43.259 --> 00:25:47.259]  This is nothing but a vehicle to take over Christianity in this country
[00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.259]  and the Jeffrey Bush's faith-based initiative, that'll be the coup de grace.
[00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:56.259]  I think the faith-based initiative is very worrisome and it's one of those things, again, it looks good.
[00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:58.259]  Who can complain about a soup kitchen feeding the hungry?
[00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:02.259]  And then you have to question what is the system that they're putting into place.
[00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:05.259]  It takes control with the tens of billions of dollars a year.
[00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:07.259]  Any other facets you want to hit on?
[00:26:07.259 --> 00:26:09.259]  I'll stop jumping in, this is just so riveting.
[00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:10.259]  You were in there for a month.
[00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:13.259]  Any other facets you want to hit on before we take calls?
[00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:16.259]  Sure. The one thing I would like to say that I think that your listeners are attuned to,
[00:26:16.259 --> 00:26:20.259]  one of the most compelling things about this group is that they're internationalists.
[00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:27.259]  And I think liberals too often dismiss fundamentalists as stupid and as provincial and local.
[00:26:27.259 --> 00:26:29.259]  And these guys are none of that.
[00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:30.259]  They're very internationalists.
[00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:31.259]  They're very sophisticated.
[00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:32.259]  They're very savvy.
[00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:33.259]  They're charming.
[00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:37.259]  They're not Jerry Falwell screaming at you on the TV.
[00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:42.259]  These groups are, you know, they look just like everyone else, as they say.
[00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:47.259]  And I think if we're going to really combat fundamentalism, we need to acknowledge that
[00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:48.259]  and give credit where credit is due.
[00:26:48.259 --> 00:26:50.259]  They can accomplish a lot and they can do a lot.
[00:26:50.259 --> 00:26:51.259]  And they're smart.
[00:26:51.259 --> 00:26:53.259]  And there's good things about their vision.
[00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:55.259]  We should try and encourage those things.
[00:26:55.259 --> 00:27:01.259]  Jeffrey, there's nothing wrong with being a fundamentalist on issues that are important.
[00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:04.259]  I'm a fundamentalist on the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:07.259]  Well, that's a little bit different than being a fundamentalist Christian.
[00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:08.259]  Well, I am a fundamentalist Christian.
[00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:13.259]  I am a fundamentalist reading of the Bible, which has no historical basis.
[00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:20.259]  You have this whole left-wing view, this whole left-wing lens that you're seeing them through.
[00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:24.259]  And, look, the globalists control the left and the right.
[00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:25.259]  You said that was important.
[00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:26.259]  That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:29.259]  That's why I'm trying to emphasize that this is an internationalist group.
[00:27:29.259 --> 00:27:32.259]  In other words, people write to me and they say, oh, I knew it.
[00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:35.259]  I knew those right-wing Republicans were, this is what they're all about.
[00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:37.259]  And I say, no, it's not a question of left and right.
[00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:44.259]  It's a question of people who believe in transparency, who believe in democracy and open debate and discussion,
[00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:47.259]  versus people who think a few elites should control everything.
[00:27:47.259 --> 00:27:49.259]  All right, let me read you another quote and then we'll go to calls.
[00:27:49.259 --> 00:27:51.259]  Maybe you'll understand once you've heard this.
[00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:53.259]  Do you know who Professor Carroll Quigley was?
[00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:54.259]  No, I don't.
[00:27:54.259 --> 00:27:57.259]  Bill Clinton thanked him in his first State of the Union address.
[00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:01.259]  He was the head of political science at Georgetown University.
[00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:02.259]  Okay?
[00:28:02.259 --> 00:28:03.259]  Okay.
[00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:06.259]  And this is what he said in his book, Tragedy and Hope.
[00:28:06.259 --> 00:28:10.259]  There does exist and has existed for a generation an international network
[00:28:10.259 --> 00:28:14.259]  which operates to some extent in the way the radical right believes the Communists do.
[00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:17.259]  In fact, this network, which we may call the roundtable groups,
[00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:20.259]  see it's roundtable interlocking groups,
[00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:25.259]  has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists or any other group and frequently does so.
[00:28:25.259 --> 00:28:29.259]  I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years
[00:28:29.259 --> 00:28:33.259]  and was permitted for two years in the early 60s to examine its papers and secret records.
[00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:38.259]  I have no aversion to it or most of its aims and have for much of my life been close to it
[00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.259]  and many of its instruments.
[00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:43.259]  I have objected both in the past and recently to a few of its policies,
[00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:48.259]  but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown
[00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:51.259]  and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known,
[00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:54.259]  Professor Carroll Quigley in his book Tragedy and Hope.
[00:28:54.259 --> 00:28:55.259]  I don't agree with that more.
[00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:58.259]  I mean that's exactly the main issue is that they wish to remain unknown.
[00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:02.259]  You can advocate whatever you want as long as you're not doing it secretly
[00:29:02.259 --> 00:29:06.259]  and you're not hiding and you're not trying to manipulate power to manipulate power secretly.
[00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:10.259]  Well, they called for dictatorship and then Ashcroft trying to pass Patriot Act II.
[00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:14.259]  Yeah, I think Ashcroft has made pretty clear where his sympathies lie.
[00:29:14.259 --> 00:29:18.259]  Well, now you say he's connected to the group. What about that?
[00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:23.259]  Yeah, in 1981 a correspondence began between he and Doug Coe
[00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:27.259]  in which they agreed to get together and pray together
[00:29:27.259 --> 00:29:32.259]  and also talk about how they could bring Jesus, remember this is their Jesus,
[00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:35.259]  their idea of Jesus, into politics.
[00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:40.259]  And they don't really have, I think, a great sense of the separation of church and state
[00:29:40.259 --> 00:29:44.259]  and I think we're seeing the effects of that right now.
[00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:51.259]  He also helped, Ashcroft helped organize within this group a series of somewhat secret
[00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:52.259]  and again that's their word.
[00:29:52.259 --> 00:29:55.259]  The organizers said this is a secret meeting for students.
[00:29:55.259 --> 00:29:58.259]  They have to handpick students from good colleges around the country,
[00:29:58.259 --> 00:30:01.259]  they're brought to a hotel, no press, no press is alerted about this.
[00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:05.259]  And someone like Ashcroft or Senator Pete Domenico of New Mexico
[00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:13.259]  will just give them a weekend seminar on how they can bring Jesus into politics
[00:30:13.259 --> 00:30:15.259]  and how you can do it without setting off alarms.
[00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:19.259]  And we bring Jesus as we secretly take over all the religious groups.
[00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:22.259]  We bring Jesus in through a Hitler model.
[00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:25.259]  Yeah, instead of saying, hey, you bring Jesus in by saying I'm a Christian
[00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:29.259]  and these are my views and you can support them or not support them if you want.
[00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:31.259]  We don't talk about abortion.
[00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:33.259]  We don't talk about the Muslims.
[00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:36.259]  Well, Ashcroft does talk about abortion and the Muslims.
[00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:41.259]  I mean, Ashcroft is a more openly dictatorial character.
[00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:44.259]  That's the front for all of this but I'm showing people the core.
[00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:47.259]  The core is much more sophisticated than Ashcroft.
[00:30:47.259 --> 00:30:48.259]  Absolutely.
[00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:50.259]  One more comment on this.
[00:30:50.259 --> 00:30:53.259]  Isn't it a conflict of interest to have seven to eight Congressmen
[00:30:53.259 --> 00:30:58.259]  who live in D.C. in a house paid for by this nonprofit shadowy group,
[00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:00.259]  as you write, connected to the CIA?
[00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:03.259]  Yeah, the building is actually registered with IRS as a church too,
[00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:09.259]  which when I think AP, Associated Press, followed up and checked it out
[00:31:09.259 --> 00:31:11.259]  and these guys are saying, oh, I didn't know that, I didn't know that,
[00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:13.259]  and I didn't even know it was any Christian.
[00:31:13.259 --> 00:31:16.259]  A Maine reporter followed up with John Elias Baldacci,
[00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:20.259]  then a Congressman, now Governor of Maine, conservative Democrat,
[00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:23.259]  and he claims he didn't even know there was any Christian element to it.
[00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:24.259]  Now, I was there.
[00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:28.259]  Every meal was preceded by a prayer and it's a fairly unconventional prayer.
[00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:30.259]  Oh, what is the prayer?
[00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:34.259]  It's always a free-form prayer and it's always to emphasize, you know,
[00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:36.259]  there's a lot you wouldn't disagree with it, you know,
[00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:40.259]  thank you, Jesus, thank you for this food, this is all good, we agree with this,
[00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:44.259]  and then emphasizing our total allegiance to this.
[00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:47.259]  And I would even have people, I would hear people say all the time,
[00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:50.259]  they say, you know, the kingdom of Christ is not a democracy
[00:31:50.259 --> 00:31:54.259]  and there can only be one king and that's what we have to pray to be broken
[00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:59.259]  and have our spirit humiliated because democracy can be a prize.
[00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:03.259]  Well, they're saying that they are the Knights Templars, basically,
[00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:05.259]  depending the grail.
[00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:09.259]  They believe that they're the new chosen and I heard that said a lot of the time,
[00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:12.259]  that they are actually, you know, the chosen or the elect,
[00:32:12.259 --> 00:32:14.259]  however you want to put that.
[00:32:14.259 --> 00:32:16.259]  And Jesus is a spirit guide in abortion.
[00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:17.259]  We don't talk about that.
[00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:19.259]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[00:32:19.259 --> 00:32:21.259]  Dan, you're on the air, then Bob in New York and others.
[00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:22.259]  Go ahead, Dan.
[00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:23.259]  Hello, Jeff.
[00:32:23.259 --> 00:32:24.259]  Hello, Dan.
[00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:25.259]  Hi, Dan.
[00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:29.259]  I think they're alluding to Hitler, whether they even admit it to themselves.
[00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:31.259]  You were just hitting on it right now.
[00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:35.259]  And it's the same mistake that all religion without the real Christ
[00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:40.259]  and all the religion without real God is, is this idea of a superior race.
[00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:42.259]  The Nazis were the superior race.
[00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:45.259]  It's a takeover system for religious organizations.
[00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:46.259]  It's a total front.
[00:32:46.259 --> 00:32:48.259]  It fits all the parameters of a cult.
[00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:52.259]  You've got congressmen living in this house paid for by the group.
[00:32:52.259 --> 00:32:53.259]  Give me a break.
[00:32:53.259 --> 00:32:57.259]  Well, Dan, I would make one important distinction is that they don't,
[00:32:57.259 --> 00:33:00.259]  and this is what separates them from a lot of those,
[00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:02.259]  because they don't believe in a superior race.
[00:33:02.259 --> 00:33:05.259]  Not that I've been able to, and I've looked in this book,
[00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:08.259]  there's people of all races involved and that's important to understand.
[00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:11.259]  What they believe in is that strength and that power.
[00:33:11.259 --> 00:33:13.259]  Now, as for the true Christ or the not true Christ,
[00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:16.259]  it's not for me to judge what's in their heart.
[00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:17.259]  Well, I don't want to have a religious debate.
[00:33:17.259 --> 00:33:19.259]  I'm talking about this sinister organization,
[00:33:19.259 --> 00:33:23.259]  and I'll call it duck-a-duck, you know, when it's yellow and quacks
[00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:25.259]  and wobbles and swims and flies.
[00:33:25.259 --> 00:33:29.259]  Now, I want to go back to the point that two of these guys threatened you
[00:33:29.259 --> 00:33:31.259]  and said, you're a traitor, you will pay.
[00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:34.259]  So I would take that very seriously.
[00:33:34.259 --> 00:33:35.259]  Anything else, Dan?
[00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:37.259]  Yeah, well, what I was going to say was,
[00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:41.259]  is that it's confusing the human accomplishments,
[00:33:41.259 --> 00:33:45.259]  and the conservative right type person,
[00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:49.259]  they are so impressed with authority and success,
[00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:51.259]  and they're trained never to doubt anything.
[00:33:51.259 --> 00:33:52.259]  This is the suck.
[00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:54.259]  Good Christians end up being their servants.
[00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:56.259]  I think you've got it right there, Dan,
[00:33:56.259 --> 00:33:58.259]  this kind of fetish for authority and success
[00:33:58.259 --> 00:34:02.259]  and confusing that with what being a good Christian is.
[00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:04.259]  Which is the total opposite message, actually.
[00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:06.259]  Well, I'll give you my analysis.
[00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:07.259]  This thing stinks to high heaven,
[00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:12.259]  and you write about the CIA connections in your article, correct, Jeff?
[00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:15.259]  I don't mention that too much.
[00:34:15.259 --> 00:34:18.259]  I think that they've always had guys in every branch of government.
[00:34:18.259 --> 00:34:22.259]  They've always had, that's not something I've explored too thoroughly,
[00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:25.259]  but I don't think that, I mean, they've got prayer groups
[00:34:25.259 --> 00:34:28.259]  in the Department of Defense and prayer groups throughout government.
[00:34:28.259 --> 00:34:32.259]  And, you know, the government's bigger than the CIA,
[00:34:32.259 --> 00:34:34.259]  and we should be worried about what's going on throughout it.
[00:34:34.259 --> 00:34:35.259]  Absolutely.
[00:34:35.259 --> 00:34:37.259]  Thanks for the call, Dan.
[00:34:37.259 --> 00:34:38.259]  Appreciate the call.
[00:34:38.259 --> 00:34:39.259]  Bob in New York, you're on the air with our guests.
[00:34:39.259 --> 00:34:40.259]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:41.259]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[00:34:41.259 --> 00:34:42.259]  Fine.
[00:34:42.259 --> 00:34:43.259]  How's Jeff today?
[00:34:43.259 --> 00:34:44.259]  Hi, Bob.
[00:34:44.259 --> 00:34:45.259]  Hi.
[00:34:45.259 --> 00:34:47.259]  Jeff, Alex brought up a point,
[00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:49.259]  and I'm going to give you some homework, if that's okay with you.
[00:34:49.259 --> 00:34:50.259]  Sure, I'd love that.
[00:34:50.259 --> 00:34:51.259]  Okay.
[00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:53.259]  There was a gentleman by the name of Anthony Sutton
[00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:56.259]  that wrote a book called America's Secret Establishment,
[00:34:56.259 --> 00:34:58.259]  a look into skull and bones.
[00:34:58.259 --> 00:35:02.259]  And where this all goes back to is a philosopher
[00:35:02.259 --> 00:35:05.259]  in the 19th century named Hegel.
[00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:09.259]  And what's amazing is if you go way back, which Anthony has done,
[00:35:09.259 --> 00:35:16.259]  is he exposes the fact that not only is skull and bones some satanic ritual,
[00:35:16.259 --> 00:35:19.259]  you know, and they do weird things inside a tomb,
[00:35:19.259 --> 00:35:26.259]  but it infiltrated all of U.S. education systems since the early 1800s.
[00:35:26.259 --> 00:35:32.259]  And the whole point of this education system is not to educate,
[00:35:32.259 --> 00:35:34.259]  it's to make you subservient.
[00:35:34.259 --> 00:35:39.259]  He also goes into their biggest ploy is eugenics.
[00:35:39.259 --> 00:35:47.259]  The head of the Nazi eugenics program was meeting in 1932 with Harriman.
[00:35:47.259 --> 00:35:50.259]  You know, this is genocide.
[00:35:50.259 --> 00:35:52.259]  They need to depopulate.
[00:35:52.259 --> 00:35:55.259]  And so they're setting up the little Christian soldiers
[00:35:55.259 --> 00:35:58.259]  who think they're Christian bringing in the world dictatorship.
[00:35:58.259 --> 00:36:00.259]  Stay there, Bob. Stay there, Jeff.
[00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:02.259]  We'll be right back with our guest. Stay with me.
[00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:29.450]  All right, folks. I really do appreciate our guest with all this great information
[00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:34.130]  and amazing research he's done, Jeffrey Charlotte. Combined with the research I've done and the
[00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:39.730]  research the globalists have done, it's stunningly scary what the globalists are setting up here
[00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.930]  and how I hear these so-called Christian leaders on the radio saying, Patriot Act 1 and 2 is good.
[00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.450]  Basically, you're not a Christian if you don't worship George Bush. They will attack you if you
[00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.010]  mention skull and bones and Bohemian Grove. They will attack you if you mention that Bush goes to
[00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:02.370]  Muslim prayer breakfasts and worships Allah. This is the new system, folks. It's just putting the
[00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.250]  name of Christ on something and then trying to sell an agenda attached to that engine.
[00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:14.290]  We're talking to Harper's writer, Jeffrey Charlotte, an award-winning author. His website
[00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:20.050]  is KillingTheBuddha.com. He's got a new book coming out. Let's go back to Bob in New York.
[00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:24.690]  Anything else real quick, Bob, you want to say to Jeffrey? Well, Jeffrey, you've done some great
[00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.250]  work. You opened up something that we weren't even aware of. Well, I was aware of it on different
[00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:37.490]  names. Opus Dei, I don't know if you've ever looked into that. I'm looking into now the
[00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:45.250]  possible connection between Opus Dei. In the late 60s, this group had a lot of trouble getting into
[00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:50.050]  Spain. They had leaders throughout the rest of the European government, but Spain, which was
[00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:58.050]  the Catholic government, this group is very Protestant. They ended up making common cause
[00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.730]  with a group of government officials who were in Opus Dei. Through that, they were able to get
[00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:07.410]  access to Franco, the dictator of Spain. These government officials, these Opus Dei guys,
[00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:12.130]  with doubts for this group and said, all right. From there on, they're doing business. They say
[00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:18.690]  in your article that, oh, we like Franco. Yeah, they did admire Franco, another dictator who
[00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:27.410]  killed a lot of his own citizens, ruled Spain for many years with US support. Again,
[00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:32.210]  they thought, this is a guy who maybe he has some problems with his policies, but we like
[00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:37.250]  the way he approaches governance because it's on the model of crisis they understand it,
[00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.690]  which is hierarchical, which is- Which is a dictatorship. Thanks for the call,
[00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:44.530]  Bob. Belly in Texas, you're on the air with our guest. Go ahead, Belly.
[00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.290]  Hello, Alex. Nice talking to you again. Nice talking to you.
[00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.930]  I called you, I think it was two weeks ago, and I was wanting to ask you about if you've seen
[00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:58.530]  44 Minutes or that, and you let me plug my website on here.
[00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.810]  Okay, sir. What's on your mind?
[00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:04.690]  Okay. Well, real quick, if I could just explain my story, would I have to explain
[00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.610]  Dwarfs what you guys have been talking about? But basically, I'm going to try to make this
[00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:14.930]  real short. The state of Michigan has just came and raped and pillaged my whole family.
[00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.330]  Well, sir, we see these horror stories every day. I may have to hold you over the next hour
[00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.210]  and you tell me you're calling in from Texas.
[00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.490]  Yeah, I'm calling from Texas. It's a child support issue.
[00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.890]  Okay, sir, I'm going to have to push you on hold because when I have a guest on,
[00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.490]  it's about that issue. You know what? I'm not going to take any more calls. I just want to
[00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:37.490]  go ahead and let our guests finish up. Sir, are there any other points you'd like to make,
[00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:42.050]  any other things you'd like to discuss about this situation you've exposed?
[00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:49.090]  I think we've covered it pretty well. I think one thing that's worth looking at is in 1945,
[00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:56.130]  the founder of the group, Abraham Brady, was using the phrase, the New World Order. He was
[00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:00.690]  working with the administrators of the Marshall Plan with which the US helped to rebuild Europe
[00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.610]  and do a lot of good work. But he was also saying, let's use that to promote this Christian agenda.
[00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.850]  And to say, look, you want to do business with us, you have to do it on these terms. You have to
[00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:17.410]  worship not only Christ, but our idea of Christ. And we're going to share on that. And I think
[00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:22.530]  it's important to understand that these groups are not, you know, it's not a bunch of bad guys
[00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:29.730]  in the back room cackling. And a lot of them do pursue this with good hearts and with good integrity.
[00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.330]  But the issue becomes, are you going to do it out in the open, out in the public? Well,
[00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.810]  we can all debate. We can say, is this a good idea or a bad idea?
[00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.410]  And they call it, and the founder called it a New World Order in just a few years
[00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.490]  and had presidential support. Exactly.
[00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.330]  Did you know that Hitler called for a New World Order, sir?
[00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.450]  I didn't, but it's not surprising.
[00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.530]  Well, you know, George W. Bush and his daddy have called for a New World Order.
[00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:57.730]  That's a popular phrase. It's a popular phrase and I think it's a phrase to watch out for.
[00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:02.930]  It means world dictatorship. Appreciate you joining us, Jeffrey Charlotte. Great job.
[00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:08.930]  Take care. Be right back with the third hour with another guest.
